<start> <start> i was informed of urgent message from titanic with her position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i immediately ordered ship turned around and put her in course for that position we being then miles s <end> <end> 
<start> <start> t from her had heads of all departments called and issued what i considered the necessary orders to be in preparation for any emergency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> saw flare half a point on port bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking this for granted to be ship shortly after we sighted our first iceberg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had previously had lookouts doubled knowing that titanic had struck ice and so took every care and precaution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we soon found ourselves in a field of bergs and had to alter course several times to clear bergs weather fine and clear light air on sea beautifully clear night though dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus doing distance in three hours and a half picking up the first boat at a <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boat in charge of officer and he reported that titanic had foundered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all survivors aboard and all boats accounted for viz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fifteen lifeboats one boat abandoned two berthon boats alongside saw one floating upwards among wreckage and according to second officer senior officer saved one berthon boat had not been launched it having got jammed making sixteen lifeboats and four berthon boats accounted for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time we had cleared first boat it was breaking day and i could see all within area of four miles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we also saw that we were surrounded by icebergs large and small huge field of drift ice with large and small bergs in it the ice field trending from n <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as far as we could see either way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave him the principal news and asked him to search and i would proceed to new york at proceeded full speed while researching over vicinity of disaster and while we were getting people aboard i gave orders to get spare hands along and swing in all our boats disconnect the fall and hoist up as many titanic boats as possible in our davits also get some on forecastle heads by derricks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got thirteen lifeboats six on forward deck and seven in davits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after getting all survivors aboard and while searching i got a clergyman to offer a short prayer of thankfulness for those saved and also a short burial service for their loss in saloon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before deciding definitely where to make for i conferred with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ismay and as he told me to do what i thought best i informed him i considered new york best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew we should require clean blankets provisions and clean linen even if we went to the azores as most of the passsengerssic saved were women and children and they hysterical not knowing what medical attention they might require <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it best to go to new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i also thought it would be better for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ismay to go to new york or england as soon as possible and knowing i should be out of wireless communication very soon if i proceeded to azores it left halifax boston and new york so i chose the latter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again the passengers were all hysterical about ice and i pointed out to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ismay the possibilities of seeing ice if i went to halifax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i knew it would be best to keep in touch with land stations as best i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have experienced great difficulty in transmitting news also names of survivors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our wireless is very poor and again we have had so many interruptions from other ships and also messages from shore principally press which we ignored <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave instructions to send first all official messages then names of passengers then survivors private messages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had haze early tuesday morning for several hours again more or less all wednesday from a <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strong southsouthwesterly winds and clear weather thursday with moderate rough sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am pleased to say that all survivors have been very plucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the majority of women first second and third class lost their husbands and considering all have been wonderfully well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tuesday our doctor reported all survivors physically well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our first class passengers have behaved splendidly given up their cabins voluntarily and supplied the ladies with clothes etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all turned out of our cabins and gave them to survivorssaloon smoking room library etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our crew also turned out to let the crew of the titanic take their quarters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am pleased to state that owing to preparations made for the comfort of survivors none were the worse for exposure etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg to specially mention how willing and cheerful the whole of the ships company behaved receiving the highest praise from everybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i can assure you i am very proud to have such a company under my command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following list of the survivors and dead contains the latest revisions and corrections of the white star line officials and was furnished by them exclusively for this book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hesitated afresh but on other grounds and only for a few seconds then i had made my choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were empty rooms at bly and it was only a question of choosing the right one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower one though high above the gardensin the solid corner of the house that i have spoken of as the old tower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a large square chamber arranged with some state as a bedroom the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years though kept by mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had often admired it and i knew my way about in it i had only after just faltering at the first chill gloom of its disuse to pass across it and unbolt as quietly as i could one of the shutters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> achieving this transit i uncovered the glass without a sound and applying my face to the pane was able the darkness without being much less than within to see that i commanded the right direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a person diminished by distance who stood there motionless and as if fascinated looking up to where i had appearedlooking that is not so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was clearly another person above methere was a person on the tower but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what i had conceived and had confidently hurried to meet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the presence on the lawni felt sick as i made it out was poor little miles himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not till late next day that i spoke to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grose the rigor with which i kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet her privately and the more as we each felt the importance of not provokingon the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the childrenany suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of mysteries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i drew a great security in this particular from her mere smooth aspect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others my horrible confidences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she believed me i was sure absolutely if she hadnt i dont know what would have become of me for i couldnt have borne the business alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she was a magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination and if she could see in our little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability their happiness and cleverness she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they had been at all visibly blighted or battered she would doubtless have grown on tracing it back haggard enough to match them as matters stood however i could feel her when she surveyed them with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all her look thank the lords mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still serve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flights of fancy gave place in her mind to a steady fireside glow and i had already begun to perceive how with the development of the conviction thatas time went on without a public accident our young things could after all look out for themselves she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their instructress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that for myself was a sound simplification i could engage that to the world my face should tell no tales but it would have been in the conditions an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the hour i now speak of she had joined me under pressure on the terrace where with the lapse of the season the afternoon sun was now agreeable and we sat there together while before us at a distance but within call if we wished the children strolled to and fro in one of their most manageable moods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they moved slowly in unison below us over the lawn the boy as they went reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grose watched them with positive placidity then i caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the tapestry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had made her a receptacle of lurid things but there was an odd recognition of my superioritymy accomplishments and my function in her patience under my pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she offered her mind to my disclosures as had i wished to mix a witchs broth and proposed it with assurance she would have held out a large clean saucepan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that in my recital of the events of the night i reached the point of what miles had said to me when after seeing him at such a monstrous hour almost on the very spot where he happened now to be i had gone down to bring him in choosing then at the window with a concentrated need of not alarming the house rather that method than a signal more resonant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a good young man and though of course acts of goodness are their own reward still i was glad he had the two halfcrowns alberts uncle gave him as well as his own good act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am not sure alice ought to have put him in the golden deed book which was supposed to be reserved for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps you will think this was the end of the source of the nile or north pole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you do it only shows how mistaken the gentlest reader may be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wounded explorer was lying with his wounds and bandages on the sofa and we were all having our tea with raspberries and white currants which we richly needed after our torrid adventures when mrs pettigrew the housekeeper put her head in at the door and please could i speak to you half a moment sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and her voice was the kind that makes you look at each other when the grownup has gone out and you are silent with your breadandbutter halfway to the next bite or your teacup in mid flight to your lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alberts uncle did not come back for a long while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we did not keep the breadandbutter on the wing all that time of course and we thought we might as well finish the raspberries and white currants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we kept some for alberts uncle of course and they were the best ones too but when he came back he did not notice our thoughtful unselfishness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came in and his face wore the look that means bed and very likely no supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke and it was the calmness of whitehot iron which is you have done it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what on earth possessed you to make a we were being beavers said h <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not see as we did where alberts uncles tone pointed to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt said alberts uncle rubbing his hands through his hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well my beavers you may go and build dams with your bolsters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your dam stopped the stream the clay you took for it left a channel through which it has run down and ruined about seven pounds worth of freshlyreaped barley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> luckily the farmer found it out in time or you might have spoiled seventy we said we were sorry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing else to say only alice of course not said alberts uncle you never do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes ill kiss youbut its bed and its two hundred lines tomorrow and the line isbeware of being beavers and burning bridges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dread we knew by that that though annoyed he was not furious we went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got jolly sick of capital bs and ds before sunset on the morrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night just as the others were falling asleep oswald well retorted his brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is one thing about it oswald went on it does show it was and filled with this agreeable thought the weary beavers or explorers polar or otherwise fell asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter it really was not such a bad babyfor a baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its face was round and quite clean which babies faces are not always as i daresay you know by your own youthful relatives and dora said its cape was trimmed with real lace whatever that may bei dont see myself how one kind of lace can be realler than another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in a very swagger sort of perambulator when we saw it and the perambulator was standing quite by itself in the lane that leads to the mill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder whose baby it is dora said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isnt it a darling alice agreed to its being one and said she thought it was most likely the child of noble parents stolen by gipsies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these two as likely as not noel said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you see something they were two tramps and they were lying on the grass at the edge of the lane on the shady side fast asleep only a very little further on than where the baby was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were very ragged and their snores did have a sinister sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i expect they stole the titled heir at dead of night and theyve been travelling hotfoot ever since so now theyre sleeping the sleep of exhaustedness alice said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a heartrending scene when the patrician mother wakes in the morning and finds the infant the baby was fast asleep or else the girls would have kissed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the author never could see anything in it himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the gipsies did steal it dora said perhaps theyd sell it to what could you do with it if youd got it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive often thought i should enjoy adopting a baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have thought there were enough of us dicky said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah but youre none of you babies said dora <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a baby he behaves jolly like one this was because of what had happened that morning when dicky found h <end> <end> 
<start> <start> going fishing with a box of worms and the box was the one dicky keeps his silver studs in and the medal he got at school and what is left of his watch and chain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the box is lined with red velvet and it was not nice afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said dicky had hurt him and he was a beastly bully and he cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we thought all this had been made up and were sorry to see it threaten to and the others came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were going to the millers with a message about some flour that hadnt come and about a sack of sharps for the pigs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after you go down the lane you come to a cloverfield and then a cornfield and then another lane and then it is the mill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a jolly fine mill in fact it is twowater and wind onesone of each kindwith a house and farm buildings as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw a mill like it and i dont believe you have either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we had been in a storybook the millers wife would have taken us into the neat sanded kitchen where the old oak settle was black with time and rubbing and dusted chairs for usold brown windsor chairsand given us each a glass of sweet scented cowslip wine and a thick slice of rich homemade cake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there would have been fresh roses in an old china bowl on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was she asked us all into the parlour and gave us eiffel tower lemonade and marie biscuits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chairs in her parlour were bent wood and no flowers except some wax ones under a glass shade but she was very kind and we were very much obliged to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got out to the miller though as soon as we could only dora and daisy stayed with her and she talked to them about her lodgers and about her relations in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he showed us all over the millsboth kindsand let us go right up into the very top of the windmill and showed us how the top moved round so that the sails could catch the wind and the great heaps of corn some red and some yellow the red is english wheat and the heaps slice down a little bit at a time into a square hole and go down to the millstones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the corn makes a rustling soft noise that is very jollysomething like the noise of the seaand you can hear it through all the other mill noises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i see what stuff he is made of he shall have a rise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i never do things at haphazard and its easier going up than coming down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ive fought the world pretty hard myself and i like to help those that are fighting it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isnt that your son coming round the corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well hes back exact to his time at any rate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him i hope he will be as punctual on monday morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if this were an imaginary story i might wind it up by a delightful denoument of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bethunes turning out an old friend of the family or developing into a new one and taking such a fancy to donald that he immediately gave him a clerkship with a large salary and the promise of a partnership on coming of age or this worthy gentleman should be an eccentric old bachelor who immediately adopted that wonderful boy and befriended the whole boyd family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but neither of these things nor anything else remarkable happened in the real story which as it is literally true though told with certain necessary disguises i prefer to keep to as closely as i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such astonishing bits of luck do not happen in real life or happen so rarely that one inclines at least to believe very little in either good or ill fortune as a matter of chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is always something at the back of it which furnishes a key to the whole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> practically a mans lot is of his own making <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may fail for a while undeservedly or he may succeed undeservedly but in the long run time brings its revenges and its rewards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has not been taken into the house of bethune co <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a partner and it was long before he became even a clerkat least with anything like a high salary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bethune so far from being an old bachelor had a large family to provide for and was bringing up several of his sons to his own business so there was little room for a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a young man who deserves to find room generally does find it or make it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and though donald started at the lowest rung of the ladder he may climb to the top yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a fair field and no favor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he determined to stand on his own feet from the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had hard work and few holidays made mistakes found them out and corrected them got sharp words and bore them learnt his own weak points andnot so easilyhis strong ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still he did learn them for unless you can trust yourself be sure nobody else will trust you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people soon found out that they might trust him that he always told the truth and never pretended to do more than he could do but that which he could do they might depend upon his doing punctually accurately carefully and never leaving off till it was done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore though others might be quicker sharper more up to things than he there was no one so reliable and it soon got to be a proverb in the office of bethune co.and other offices tooif you wish a thing done go to boyd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am bound to say this for i am painting no imaginary portrait but describing an individual who really exists and who may be met any day walking about edinburgh though his name is not donald boyd and there is no such firm as bethune co <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the house he does belong to values the young fellow so highly that there is little doubt he will rise in it and rise in every way probably to the very top of the tree and tell his children and grandchildren the story which in its main features i have recorded here of how he first began facing the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went to the zoo the leopard to see but found him an unsociable fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not look at us or say where he bought his polkadot suit of yellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> merrily swinging on briar and weed near to the nest of his little dame over the mountainside or mead robert of lincoln is telling his name bobolink bobolink spink spank spink snug and safe in that nest of ours hidden among the summer flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no not exactly that but ralph paused and looked puzzled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something in the earnestness of her manner which made a facetious compliment seem grossly inappropriate and in the moment no other escape suggested itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then answered he while his features lighted up with a happy inspirationthen you will appreciate my situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fondly cherished my old picture of you in my memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i have lost it and i cannot help regretting the loss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not mean however to imply that this new acquaintancethis second edition of yourself so to speakwill prove less interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she again sent him a grave questioning look and began to gaze intently upon the stone in her bracelet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you will laugh at me began she while a sudden blush flitted over her countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this is my first ball and i feel as if i had rushed into a whirlpool from which i have since the first rash plunge was made been vainly trying to escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hardly know anybody here except my cousin who invited me and i hardly think i know him either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well since you are irredeemably committed replied ralph as the music after some prefatory flourishes broke into the delicious rhythm of a strauss waltz then it is no use struggling against fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he offered her his arm and she arose somewhat hesitatingly and followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid she whispered as they fell into line with the procession that was moving down the long hall that you have asked me to dance merely because i said i felt forlorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if that is the case i should prefer to be led back to my seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something so charmingly naiive in this selfdepreciationsomething so altogether novel in his experience and he could not help adding just a little bit countrified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his spirits rose he began to relish keenly his position as an experienced man of the world and in the agreeable glow of patronage and conscious superiority chatted with hearty abandon with his little rustic beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if your dancing is as perfect as your german exercises were said she laughing as they swung out upon the floor then i promise myself a good deal of pleasure from our meeting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never fear answered he quickly reversing his step and whirling with many a capricious turn away among the thronging couples <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when ralph drove home in his carriage toward morning he briefly summed up his impressions of bertha in the following adjectives intelligent delightfully unsophisticated a little bit verdant but devilish pretty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some weeks later colonel grim received an appointment at the fortress of aggershuus and immediately took up his residence in the capital <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw that his son cut a fine figure in the highest circles of society and expressed his gratification in the most emphatic terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had known however that ralph was in the habit of visiting with alarming regularity at the house of a plebeian merchant in a somewhat obscure street he would no doubt have been more chary of his praise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the colonel suspected nothing and it was well for the peace of the family that he did not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may have been cowardice in ralph that he never mentioned berthas name to his family or to his aristocratic acquaintances for to be candid he himself felt ashamed of the power she exerted over him and by turns pitied and ridiculed himself for pursuing so inglorious a conquest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless it wounded his egotism that she never showed any surprise at seeing him that she received him with a certain frank unceremoniousness which however was very becoming to her that she invariably went on with her work heedless of his presence and in everything treated him as if she had been his equal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she persisted in talking with him in a half sisterly fashion about his studies and his future career warned him with great solicitude against some of his reprobate friends of whose merry adventures he had told her and if he ventured to compliment her on her beauty or her accomplishments she would look up gravely from her sewing or answer him in a way which seemed to banish the idea of lovemaking into the land of the impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was constantly tormented by the suspicion that she secretly disapproved of him and that from a mere moral interest in his welfare she was conscientiously laboring to make him a better man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> day after day he parted from her feeling humiliated fainthearted and secretly indignant both at himself and her and day after day he returned only to renew the same experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last it became too intolerable he could endure it no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let it make or break certainty at all risks was at least preferable to this sickening suspense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he loved her he could no longer doubt let his parents foam and fret as much as they pleased for once he was going to stand on his own legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the end he thought they would have to yield for they had no son but him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertha was going to return to her home on the seacoast in a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ralph stood in the little lowceiled parlor as she imagined to bid her goodbye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had been speaking of her father her brothers and the farm and she had expressed the wish that if he ever should come to that part of the country he might pay them a visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her words had kindled a vague hope in his breast but in their very frankness and friendly regard there was something which slew the hope they had begotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held her hand in his and her large confiding eyes shone with an emotion which was beautiful but was yet not love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were two or three people with him but it seemed as if for a moment he had forgotten themhad forgotten where he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered suddenly if his daughter had been fond of irises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was looking at them with such a tender lost expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl who was a lovely fair thing was standing quite close to him with her hand in his arm and she was smiling toosuch a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl with her hand in his arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see how fair she is i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood very still looking across the flowers at the group <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a singular interest and intensity in his expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he watched the pair silently for a whole minute i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yees he said slowly at last i do see what you meanand it is lovely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must be a new friend of my mothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she is one of the white people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looks like a white iris herself doesnt she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macnairn later who the girl was but she didnt seem to recognize my description of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> le breton had gone away by that time and so had the girl herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tall very fair one in the misty pale gray dress i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> le breton when he was looking at the irisbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were cutting some roses only a few yards away from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred keith is fair she reflected but she was not there then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i she paused again and turned toward her son who was standing watching us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw their eyes meet in a rather arrested way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took her almost two hours to dress her hair and by that time it was too late for her usual morning audience so she proposed holding that after the foreigners had gone away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at herself in the lookingglass with her imperial robe on and told me that she did not like it and asked me whether i thought the foreigners would know that it was an official robe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it makes my face look the same color as my robe she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suggested that as it was only a private audience if she wished to dress differently it would not matter at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed delighted and i was afraid lest i had not made a proper suggestion but anyway i was too busy to worry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her majesty ordered that her different gowns should be brought in and after looking them over she selected one embroidered all over with the character shou long life covered with precious stones and pearls on pale green satin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tried it on and said that it was becoming to her so she ordered me to go to the jewelroom and get flowers to match for her hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one side of the headdress was the character shou and on the other side was a bat the bat in china is considered to be lucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course her shoes handkerchiefs and everything else were embroidered in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after she was dressed she smiled and said i look all right now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had better go to the audience hall and wait for them and at the same time we can play a game of dice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then to us all she said all of you will stay at the back of the screen during the audience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can see all right but i dont wish that you should be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eunuchs had laid the map down on the table and were just going to commence playing dice when one of the high rank eunuchs came into the hall and kneeling down said that the american admiral had arrived at the palace gate together with the american ministerten or twelve people altogether <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her majesty smiled and said to me i thought it was just going to be the american minister and the admiral and one or two of his staff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who can the rest of the people be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however never mind i will receive them anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we helped her to mount her throne upon the dais fixed her clothes and handed her the paper containing the speech she was to give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we went back of the screen with the young empress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so very quiet not a sound anywhere that we could hear the boots of the visitors as they walked over the stones in the courtyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were peeping from behind the screen and could see several of the princes mounting the steps conducting these people to the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the admiral and the american minister came in and stood in a line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they bowed three times to the empress dowager <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the emperor was also on his throne sitting at her left hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his throne was very small just like an ordinary chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her majestys speech was simply to welcome the admiral to china <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they then came up to the dais and shook hands with their majesties ascending on one side and retiring down the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prince ching took them into another palace building where they had lunch and the audience was over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the audience was over her majesty said that she could hear us laughing behind the screen and that maybe the people would talk about it and did not like it at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told her that it was not myself who laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said the next time when i have men in audience you need not come into the audience hall at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it is different when i have my own people at the morning audiences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her majesty did not go to her bedroom that afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said she wanted to wait until these people had gone and hear what they had to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a couple of hours prince ching came in and reported that they had lunched and that they were very pleased to have seen her majesty and had gone away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must here explain that the admiral had entered by the left gate of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the middle gate was only used for their majesties with one exception viz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the admiral left by the same gate he had entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her majesty asked prince ching whether he had showed them around the palace buildings or not this was in the summer palace and what they had thought about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did they say anything and were they pleased or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said to prince ching you can go now and make the necessary preparations for the ladies audience next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that same evening her majesty said to us you must all dress alike tomorrow and wear your prettiest clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these foreign ladies who are coming to the palace may never see us again and if we dont show them what we have now we will not have another opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ordered us all including the young empress to wear pale blue also the secondary wife of the emperor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said to me if the ladies ask who the secondary wife is you can tell them but if they dont ask i dont want you to introduce her to them at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these people at the palace here are not used to seeing so many people and they might not have nice manners and the foreigners will laugh at them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she said to us again i always give presents when ladies come to the court but dont know whether i will give this time or not for at the last audience i did not give anything at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> addressing me she said you can prepare some pieces of jade in case i need them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put them in a nice box and have them all ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont bring them to me until i ask for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said we have talked enough now and you can all go to rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was only too glad to go to my own room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning everything went on very nicely and there was no trouble at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her majesty was well satisfied for we had all taken great care in fixing ourselves up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said to me you never put enough paint on your face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will have to paint your lips as that is the custom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont need you yet so go back and put some more paint on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i went back to my room and painted myself just like the rest of them but i could not help laughing at seeing myself so changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time i got to her room again she said now you look all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you think that powder is expensive i will buy some for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said that with a laugh for she always liked to tease me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time her majesty had finished her toilet one of the ladies brought a number of gowns for her to select one from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said she would wear pale blue that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked over twenty or thirty gowns but found nothing which suited her so she gave orders for some more to be brought in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally she chose a blue gown embroidered with one hundred butterflies and wore a purple sleeveless jacket which was also embroidered with butterflies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the bottom of this gown were pearl tassels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore her largest pearls one of which was almost as large as an egg and was her favorite jewel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore two jade butterflies on each side of her headdress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her bracelets and rings were also all designed in butterflies in fact everything matched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among her beautiful jewels she always wore some kind of fresh flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young empress and the court ladies were not allowed to wear fresh flowers at all unless given to them by her majesty as a special favor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she said that the fresh flowers were for her her idea being that we were too young and might spoil fresh flowers if we wore them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after she was dressed we went into the audience hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ordered her cards to be brought in as she wanted to play solitaire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she talked all the time she was playing and said that we must all be very nice and polite to the american ladies and show them everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said it doesnt matter now for we have everything changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will imagine we are always like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and bye if they question you about anything just tell them that it is not so and that we change everything at each audience just to give them a bit of surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must tell it some day otherwise no one will know it at all and the trouble would not be worth the while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a private audience for ladies and her majesty did not use the big throne but was sitting on her little throne at the left side of the audience hall where she received her own ministers every morning the emperor was standing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a eunuch came in the same as the day before and announced that the ladies had arrived at the palace gate nine in all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her majesty sent some of the court ladies to meet them in the courtyard and bring them to the audience hall which they did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was standing at the right side of her majestys chair and could see them mounting the steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her majesty whispered to me and asked which one is mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i had never seen the lady i answered that i could not tell but when they got nearer i saw a lady walking with the american ministers wife and concluded that she must be mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they got nearer her majesty said again that missionary lady with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think she must like to see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell her i am very glad to see her always and see if she understands what i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still i stuck to my bottle like any fine old english gentleman all of the olden time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more the bottle was interfered with the stauncher i became if possible in my first determination that my countryman should have it delivered to him intact as the man whom he had so nobly restored to life and liberty had delivered it to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever i had been obstinate in my days and i may have been say once or twice i was obstinate about the bottle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i made it a rule always to keep a pocket full of small coin at its service and never to be out of temper in its cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus i and the bottle made our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once we had a breakdown rather a bad breakdown on a steep high place with the sea below us on a tempestuous evening when it blew great guns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were driving four wild horses abreast southern fashion and there was some little difficulty in stopping them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was outside and not thrown off but no words can describe my feelings when i saw the bottle travelling inside as usual burst the door open and roll obesely out into the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a blessed bottle with a charmed existence he took no hurt and we repaired damage and went on triumphant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a thousand representations were made to me that the bottle must be left at this place or that and called for again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never yielded to one of them and never parted from the bottle on any pretence consideration threat or entreaty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no faith in any official receipt for the bottle and nothing would induce me to accept one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these unmanageable politics at last brought me and the bottle still triumphant to genoa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there i took a tender and reluctant leave of him for a few weeks and consigned him to a trusty english captain to be conveyed to the port of london by sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the bottle was on his voyage to england i read the shipping intelligence as anxiously as if i had been an underwriter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was some stormy weather after i myself had got to england by way of switzerland and france and my mind greatly misgave me that the bottle might be wrecked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last to my great joy i received notice of his safe arrival and immediately went down to saint katharines docks and found him in a state of honourable captivity in the custom house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wine was mere vinegar when i set it down before the generous englishman probably it had been something like vinegar when i took it up from giovanni carlavero but not a drop of it was spilled or gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the englishman told me with much emotion in his face and voice that he had never tasted wine that seemed to him so sweet and sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and long afterwards the bottle graced his table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the last time i saw him in this world that misses him he took me aside in a crowd to say with his amiable smile we were talking of you only today at dinner and i wished you had it is an unsettled question with me whether i shall leave calais something handsome in my will or whether i shall leave it my malediction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hate it so much and yet i am always so very glad to see it that i am in a state of constant indecision on this subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i first made acquaintance with calais it was as a maundering young wretch in a clammy perspiration and dripping saline particles who was conscious of no extremities but the one great extremity seasickness who was a mere bilious torso with a mislaid headache somewhere in its stomach who had been put into a horrible swing in dover harbour and had tumbled giddily out of it on the french coast or the isle of man or anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> times have changed and now i enter calais selfreliant and rational <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know where it is beforehand i keep a look out for it i recognise its landmarks when i see any of them i am acquainted with its ways and i know and i can bear its worst behaviour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lowlying alligator evading the eyesight and discouraging hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dodging flat streak now on this bow now on that now anywhere now everywhere now nowhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain cape grinez coming frankly forth into the sea exhorts the failing to be stout of heart and stomach sneaking calais prone behind its bar invites emetically to despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even when it can no longer quite conceal itself in its muddy dock it has an evil way of falling off has calais which is more hopeless than its invisibility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pier is all but on the bowsprit and you think you are there roll roar wash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> calais has retired miles inland and dover has burst out to look for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has a last dip and slide in its character has calais to be especially commanded to the infernal gods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thrice accursed be that garrisontown when it dives under the boats keel and comes up a league or two to the right with the packet shivering and spluttering and staring about for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not but what i have my animosities towards dover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i particularly detest dover for the selfcomplacency with which it goes to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it always goes to bed when i am going to calais with a more brilliant display of lamp and candle than any other town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> birmingham host and hostess of the lord warden hotel are my much esteemed friends but they are too conceited about the comforts of that establishment when the night mail is starting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know it is a good house to stay at and i dont want the fact insisted upon in all its warm bright windows at such an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know the warden is a stationary edifice that never rolls or pitches and i object to its big outline seeming to insist upon that circumstance and as it were to come over me with it when i am reeling on the deck of the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beshrew the warden likewise for obstructing that corner and making the wind so angry as it rushes round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall i not know that it blows quite soon enough without the officious wardens interference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i wait here on board the night packet for the southeastern train to come down with the mail dover appears to me to be illuminated for some intensely aggravating festivity in my personal dishonour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all its noises smack of taunting praises of the land and dispraises of the gloomy sea and of me for going on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the drums upon the heights have gone to bed or i know they would rattle taunts against me for having my unsteady footing on this slippery deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the many gas eyes of the marine parade twinkle in an offensive manner as if with derision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the distant dogs of dover bark at me in my misshapen wrappers as if i were richard the third <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a screech a bell and two red eyes come gliding down the admiralty pier with a smoothness of motion rendered more smooth by the heaving of the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sea makes noises against the pier as if several hippopotami were lapping at it and were prevented by circumstances over which they had no control from drinking peaceably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we the boat become violently agitated rumble hum scream roar and establish an immense family washingday at each paddlebox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bright patches break out in the train as the doors of the postoffice vans are opened and instantly stooping figures with sacks upon their backs begin to be beheld among the piles descending as it would seem in ghostly procession to davy joness locker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passengers come on board a few shadowy frenchmen with hatboxes shaped like the stoppers of gigantic casebottles a few shadowy germans in immense fur coats and boots a few shadowy englishmen prepared for the worst and pretending not to expect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot disguise from my uncommercial mind the miserable fact that we are a body of outcasts that the attendants on us are as scant in number as may serve to get rid of us with the least possible delay that there are no nightloungers interested in us that the unwilling lamps shiver and shudder at us that the sole object is to commit us to the deep and abandon us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lo the two red eyes glaring in increasing distance and then the very train itself has gone to bed before we are off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the moral support derived by some seagoing amateurs from an umbrella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do certain voyagers across the channel always put up that article and hold it up with a grim and fierce tenacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fellowcreature near me whom i only know to be a fellowcreature because of his umbrella without which he might be a dark bit of cliff pier or bulkbead clutches that instrument with a desperate grasp that will not relax until he lands at calais <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there any analogy in certain constitutions between keeping an umbrella up and keeping the spirits up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hawser thrown on board with a flop replies stand by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stout wooden wedge driven in at my right temple and out at my left a floating deposit of lukewarm oil in my throat and a compression of the bridge of my nose in a blunt pair of pincers these are the personal sensations by which i know we are off and by which i shall continue to know it until i am on the soil of france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my symptoms have scarcely established themselves comfortably when two or three skating shadows that have been trying to walk or stand get flung together and other two or three shadows in tarpaulin slide with them into corners and cover them up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the south foreland lights begin to hiccup at us in a way that bodes no good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is at about this period that my detestation of calais knows no bounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inwardly i resolve afresh that i never will forgive that hated town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have done so before many times but that is past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> implacable animosity to calais everm that was an awkward sea and the funnel seems of my opinion for it gives a complaining roar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind blows stiffly from the noreast the sea runs high we ship a deal of water the night is dark and cold and the shapeless passengers lie about in melancholy bundles as if they were sorted out for the laundress but for my own uncommercial part i cannot pretend that i am much inconvenienced by any of these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a general howling whistling flopping gurgling and scooping i am aware of and a general knocking about of nature but the impressions i receive are very vague <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a sweet faint temper something like the smell of damaged oranges i think i should feel languidly benevolent if i had time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not time because i am under a curious compulsion to occupy myself with the irish melodies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rich and rare were the gems she wore is the particular melody to which i find myself devoted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sing it to myself in the most charming manner and with the greatest expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then i raise my head i am sitting on the hardest of wet seats in the most uncomfortable of wet attitudes but i dont mind it and notice that i am a whirling shuttlecock between a fiery battledore of a lighthouse on the french coast and a fiery battledore of a lighthouse on the english coast but i dont notice it particularly except to feel envenomed in my hatred of calais <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i go on again rich and rare were the geems she eee wore and a bright gold ring on her waand she boore but o her beauty was faaaar beyond i am particularly proud of my execution here when i become aware of another awkward shock from the sea and another protest from the funnel and a fellowcreature at the paddlebox more audibly indisposed than i think he need be her sparkling gems or snowwhite wand but o her beauty was faa aaar beyond another awkward one here and the fellowcreature with the umbrella down and picked up her spaarkling geems or her port <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snowwhite fellowcreature at the as my execution of the irish melodies partakes of my imperfect perceptions of what is going on around me so what is going on around me becomes something else than what it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stokers open the furnace doors below to feed the fires and i am again on the box of the old exeter telegraph fast coach and that is the light of the for ever extinguished coachlamps and the gleam on the hatches and paddleboxes is their gleam on cottages and haystacks and the monotonous noise of the engines is the steady jingle of the splendid team <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anon the intermittent funnel roar of protest at every violent roll becomes the regular blast of a high pressure engine and i recognise the exceedingly explosive steamer in which i ascended the mississippi when the american civil war was not and when only its causes were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fragment of mast on which the light of a lantern falls an end of rope and a jerking block or so become suggestive of franconis circus at paris where i shall be this very night mayhap for it must be morning now and they dance to the selfsame time and tune as the trained steed black raven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what may be the speciality of these waves as they come rushing on i cannot desert the pressing demands made upon me by the gems she wore to inquire but they are charged with something about robinson crusoe and i think it was in yarmouth roads that he first went a seafaring and was near foundering what a terrific sound that word had for me when i was a boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still through all this i must ask her who was she i wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the fiftieth time and without ever stopping does she not fear to stray so lone and lovely through this bleak way and are erins sons so good or so cold as not to be tempted by more fellow creatures at the paddlebox or gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir knight i feel not the least alarm no son of erin will offer me harm for though they love fellowcreature with umbrella down again and golden store sir knight they what a tremendous one love honour and virtue more for though they love stewards with a bulls eye bright theyll trouble you for your ticket sirrough passage tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i freely admit it to be a miserable piece of human weakness and inconsistency but i no sooner become conscious of those last words from the steward than i begin to soften towards calais <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereas i have been vindictively wishing that those calais burghers who came out of their town by a short cut into the history of england with those fatal ropes round their necks by which they have since been towed into so many cartoons had all been hanged on the spot i now begin to regard them as highly respectable and virtuous tradesmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking about me i see the light of cape grinez well astern of the boat on the davits to leeward and the light of calais harbour undeniably at its old tricks but still ahead and shining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sentiments of forgiveness of calais not to say of attachment to calais begin to expand my bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have weak notions that i will stay there a day or two on my way back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a faded and recumbent stranger pausing in a profound reverie over the rim of a basin asks me what kind of place calais is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a very agreeable place indeed rather hilly than otherwise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well only when ive been very much tempted said miss ophelia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i always resolve i wont and i try to break off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i have been resolving i wont off and on these ten years said st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare but i havent some how got clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you got clear of all your sins cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cousin augustine said miss ophelia seriously and laying down her knittingwork i suppose i deserve that you should reprove my shortcomings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know all you say is true enough nobody else feels them more than i do but it does seem to me after all there is some difference between me and you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me i would cut off my right hand sooner than keep on from day to day doing what i thought was wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then my conduct is so inconsistent with my profession i dont wonder you reprove me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o now cousin said augustine sitting down on the floor and laying his head back in her lap dont take on so awfully serious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know what a goodfornothing saucy boy i always was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i love to poke you upthats alljust to see you get earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do think you are desperately distressingly good it tires me to death to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this is a serious subject my boy auguste said miss ophelia laying her hand on his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dismally so said he and iwell i never want to talk seriously in hot weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what with mosquitos and all a fellow cant get himself up to any very sublime moral flights and i believe said st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare suddenly rousing himself up theres a theory now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understand now why northern nations are always more virtuous than southern onesi see into that whole subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well so i am i suppose but for once i will be serious now but you must hand me that basket of orangesyou see youll have to stay me with flagons and comfort me with apples if im going to make this effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said augustine drawing the basket up ill begin when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a fellow to hold two or three dozen of his fellowworms in captivity a decent regard to the opinions of society requires i dont see that you are growing more serious said miss ophelia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the short of the matter is cousin said he his handsome face suddenly settling into an earnest and serious expression on this abstract question of slavery there can as i think be but one opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> planters who have money to make by itclergymen who have planters to pleasepoliticians who want to rule by itmay warp and bend language and ethics to a degree that shall astonish the world at their ingenuity they can press nature and the bible and nobody knows what else into the service but after all neither they nor the world believe in it one particle the more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it comes from the devil thats the short of itand to my mind its a pretty respectable specimen of what he can do in his own line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss ophelia stopped her knitting and looked surprised and st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you seem to wonder but if you will get me fairly at it ill make a clean breast of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this cursed business accursed of god and man what is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strip it of all its ornament run it down to the root and nucleus of the whole and what is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why because my brother quashy is ignorant and weak and i am intelligent and strongbecause i know how and can do ittherefore i may steal all he has keep it and give him only such and so much as suits my fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever is too hard too dirty too disagreeable for me i may set quashy to doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i dont like work quashy shall work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because the sun burns me quashy shall stay in the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quashy shall earn the money and i will spend it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quashy shall lie down in every puddle that i may walk over dryshod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quashy shall do my will and not his all the days of his mortal life and have such chance of getting to heaven at last as i find convenient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i take to be about what slavery is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i defy anybody on earth to read our slavecode as it stands in our lawbooks and make anything else of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing itself is the essence of all abuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the only reason why the land dont sink under it like sodom and gomorrah is because it is used in a way infinitely better than it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for pitys sake for shames sake because we are men born of women and not savage beasts many of us do not and dare notwe would scorn to use the full power which our savage laws put into our hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he who goes the furthest and does the worst only uses within limits the power that the law gives him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare had started up and as his manner was when excited was walking with hurried steps up and down the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his fine face classic as that of a greek statue seemed actually to burn with the fervor of his feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his large blue eyes flashed and he gestured with an unconscious eagerness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss ophelia had never seen him in this mood before and she sat perfectly silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i declare to you said he suddenly stopping before his cousin its no sort of use to talk or to feel on this subject but i declare to you there have been times when i have thought if the whole country would sink and hide all this injustice and misery from the light i would willingly sink with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i have been travelling up and down on our boats or about on my collecting tours and reflected that every brutal disgusting mean lowlived fellow i met was allowed by our laws to become absolute despot of as many men women and children as he could cheat steal or gamble money enough to buywhen i have seen such men in actual ownership of helpless children of young girls and womeni have been ready to curse my country to curse the human race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said miss ophelia im sure youve said enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never in my life heard anything like this even at the north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare with a sudden change of expression and resuming something of his habitual careless tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your northern folks are coldblooded you are cool in everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant begin to curse up hill and down as we can when we get fairly at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well but the question is said miss ophelia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o yes to be sure the question isand a deuce of a question it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how came you in this state of sin and misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i shall answer in the good old words you used to teach me sundays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my servants were my fathers and what is more my mothers and now they are mine they and their increase which bids fair to be a pretty considerable item <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father you know came first from new england and he was just such another man as your fathera regular old romanupright energetic nobleminded with an iron will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father settled down in new england to rule over rocks and stones and to force an existence out of nature and mine settled in louisiana to rule over men and women and force existence out of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare getting up and walking to a picture at the end of the room and gazing upward with a face fervent with veneration she was divine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont look at me so!you know what i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she probably was of mortal birth but as far as ever i could observe there was no trace of any human weakness or error about her and everybody that lives to remember her whether bond or free servant acquaintance relation all say the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why cousin that mother has been all that has stood between me and utter unbelief for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a direct embodiment and personification of the new testamenta living fact to be accounted for and to be accounted for in no other way than by its truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare clasping his hands in a sort of transport and then suddenly checking himself he came back and my brother and i were twins and they say you know that twins ought to resemble each other but we were in all points a contrast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had black fiery eyes coalblack hair a strong fine roman profile and a rich brown complexion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had blue eyes golden hair a greek outline and fair complexion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was active and observing i dreamy and inactive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was generous to his friends and equals but proud dominant overbearing to inferiors and utterly unmerciful to whatever set itself up against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> truthful we both were he from pride and courage i from a sort of abstract ideality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we loved each other about as boys generally dooff and on and in generalhe was my fathers pet and i my mothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a morbid sensitiveness and acuteness of feeling in me on all possible subjects of which he and my father had no kind of understanding and with which they could have no possible sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mother did and so when i had quarreled with alfred and father looked sternly on me i used to go off to mothers room and sit by her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember just how she used to look with her pale cheeks her deep soft serious eyes her white dressshe always wore white and i used to think of her whenever i read in revelations about the saints that were arrayed in fine linen clean and white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a great deal of genius of one sort and another particularly in music and she used to sit at her organ playing fine old majestic music of the catholic church and singing with a voice more like an angel than a mortal woman and i would lay my head down on her lap and cry and dream and feeloh immeasurably!things that i had no language to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in those days this matter of slavery had never been canvassed as it has now nobody dreamed of any harm in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think in some preexistent state he must have been in the higher circles of spirits and brought all his old court pride along with him for it was ingrain bred in the bone though he was originally of poor and not in any way of noble family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now an aristocrat you know the world over has no human sympathies beyond a certain line in society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in england the line is in one place in burmah in another and in america in another but the aristocrat of all these countries never goes over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would be hardship and distress and injustice in his own class is a cool matter of course in another one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my fathers dividing line was that of color <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among his equals never was a man more just and generous but he considered the negro through all possible gradations of color as an intermediate link between man and animals and graded all his ideas of justice or generosity on this hypothesis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose to be sure if anybody had asked him plump and fair whether they had human immortal souls he might have hemmed and hawed and said yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my father was not a man much troubled with spiritualism religious sentiment he had none beyond a veneration for god as decidedly the head of the upper classes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well my father worked some five hundred negroes he was an inflexible driving punctilious business man everything was to move by systemto be sustained with unfailing accuracy and precision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if you take into account that all this was to be worked out by a set of lazy twaddling shiftless laborers who had grown up all their lives in the absence of every possible motive to learn how to do anything but shirk as you vermonters say and youll see that there might naturally be on his plantation a great many things that looked horrible and distressing to a sensitive child like me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides all he had an overseergreat tall slabsided twofisted renegade son of vermontbegging your pardonwho had gone through a regular apprenticeship in hardness and brutality and taken his degree to be admitted to practice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother never could endure him nor i but he obtained an entire ascendency over my father and this man was the absolute despot of the estate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a little fellow then but i had the same love that i have now for all kinds of human thingsa kind of passion for the study of humanity come in what shape it would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was found in the cabins and among the fieldhands a great deal and of course was a great favorite and all sorts of complaints and grievances were breathed in my ear and i told them to mother and we between us formed a sort of committee for a redress of grievances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hindered and repressed a great deal of cruelty and congratulated ourselves on doing a vast deal of good till as often happens my zeal overacted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stubbs complained to my father that he couldnt manage the hands and must resign his position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father was a fond indulgent husband but a man that never flinched from anything that he thought necessary and so he put down his foot like a rock between us and the fieldhands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told my mother in language perfectly respectful and deferential but quite explicit that over the houseservants she should be entire mistress but that with the fieldhands he could allow no interference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he revered and respected her above all living beings but he would have said it all the same to the virgin mary herself if she had come in the way of his system <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used sometimes to hear my mother reasoning cases with himendeavoring to excite his sympathies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would listen to the most pathetic appeals with the most discouraging politeness and equanimity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it all resolves itself into this he would say must i part with stubbs or keep him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stubbs is the soul of punctuality honesty and efficiencya thorough business hand and as humane as the general run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant have perfection and if i keep him i must sustain his administration as a whole even if there are now and then things that are exceptionable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> general rules will bear hard on particular cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this last maxim my father seemed to consider a settler in most alleged cases of cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after he had said that he commonly drew up his feet on the sofa like a man that has disposed of a business and betook himself to a nap or the newspaper as the case might be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact is my father showed the exact sort of talent for a statesman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could have divided poland as easily as an orange or trod on ireland as quietly and systematically as any man living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last my mother gave up in despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it never will be known till the last account what noble and sensitive natures like hers have felt cast utterly helpless into what seems to them an abyss of injustice and cruelty and which seems so to nobody about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has been an age of long sorrow of such natures in such a hellbegotten sort of world as ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what remained for her but to train her children in her own views and sentiments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well after all you say about training children will grow up substantially what they are by nature and only that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the cradle alfred was an aristocrat and as he grew up instinctively all his sympathies and all his reasonings were in that line and all mothers exhortations went to the winds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to me they sunk deep into me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she never contradicted in form anything my father said or seemed directly to differ from him but she impressed burnt into my very soul with all the force of her deep earnest nature an idea of the dignity and worth of the meanest human soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have looked in her face with solemn awe when she would point up to the stars in the evening and say to me see there auguste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poorest meanest soul on our place will be living when all these stars are she had some fine old paintings one in particular of jesus healing a blind man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were very fine and used to impress me strongly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see there auguste she would say the blind man was a beggar poor and loathsome therefore he would not heal him afar off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called him to him and put his hands on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had lived to grow up under her care she might have stimulated me to i know not what of enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might have been a saint reformer martyrbut alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went from her when i was only thirteen and i never saw her again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare rested his head on his hands and did not speak what poor mean trash this whole business of human virtue is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mere matter for the most part of latitude and longitude and geographical position acting with natural temperament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the greater part is nothing but an accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father for example settles in vermont in a town where all are in fact free and equal becomes a regular church member and deacon and in due time joins an abolition society and thinks us all little better than heathens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet he is for all the world in constitution and habit a duplicate of my father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can see it leaking out in fifty different waysjust the same strong overbearing dominant spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know very well how impossible it is to persuade some of the folks in your village that squire sinclair does not feel above them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact is though he has fallen on democratic times and embraced a democratic theory he is to the heart an aristocrat as much as my father who ruled over five or six hundred slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss ophelia felt rather disposed to cavil at this picture and was laying down her knitting to begin but st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i know every word you are going to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not say they were alike in fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one fell into a condition where everything acted against the natural tendency and the other where everything acted for it and so one turned out a pretty wilful stout overbearing old democrat and the other a wilful stout old despot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if both had owned plantations in louisiana they would have been as like as two old bullets cast in the same mould <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mean them any disrespect said st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know when father died he left the whole property to us twin boys to be divided as we should agree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there does not breathe on gods earth a noblersouled more generous fellow than alfred in all that concerns his equals and we got on admirably with this property question without a single unbrotherly word or feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we undertook to work the plantation together and alfred whose outward life and capabilities had double the strength of mine became an enthusiastic planter and a wonderfully successful one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but two years trial satisfied me that i could not be a partner in that matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to have a great gang of seven hundred whom i could not know personally or feel any individual interest in bought and driven housed fed worked like so many horned cattle strained up to military precisionthe question of how little of lifes commonest enjoyments would keep them in working order being a constantly recurring problemthe necessity of drivers and overseersthe evernecessary whip first last and only argumentthe whole thing was insufferably disgusting and loathsome to me and when i thought of my mothcrs estimate of one poor human soul it became even frightful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all nonsense to talk to me about slaves enjoying all this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this day i have no patience with the unutterable trash that some of your patronizing northerners have made up as in their zeal to apologize for our sins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me that any man living wants to work all his days from daydawn till dark under the constant eye of a master without the power of putting forth one irresponsible volition on the same dreary monotonous unchanging toil and all for two pairs of pantaloons and a pair of shoes a year with enough food and shelter to keep him in working order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any man who thinks that human beings can as a general thing be made about as comfortable that way as any other i wish he might try it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id buy the dog and work him with a clear conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always have supposed said miss ophelia that you all of you approved of these things and thought them rightaccording to scripture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are not quite reduced to that yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alfred who is as determined a despot as ever walked does not pretend to this kind of defenceno he stands high and haughty on that good old respectable ground the right of the strongest and he says and i think quite sensibly that the american planter is only doing in another form what the english aristocracy and capitalists are doing by the lower classes that is i take it appropriating them body and bone soul and spirit to their use and convenience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he defends bothand i think at least consistently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says that there can be no high civilization without enslavement of the masses either nominal or real <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there must he says be a lower class given up to physical toil and confined to an animal nature and a higher one thereby acquires leisure and wealth for a more expanded intelligence and improvement and becomes the directing soul of the lower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he reasons because as i said he is born an aristocratso i dont believe because i was born a democrat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how in the world can the two things be compared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the english laborer is not sold traded parted from his family whipped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slaveowner can whip his refractory slave to deaththe capitalist can starve him to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to family security it is hard to say which is the worstto have ones children sold or see them starve to death at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its no kind of apology for slavery to prove that it isnt worse than some other bad thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i never saw her again not even when she died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i loved the mother and she deceived me and disgraced me and broke my heart and i only wish she had killed me and i was beginning to love her child and i vowed she should not live to trick me too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had suffered as no man i know had suffered in a way a boy like you cannot understand and that no one can understand who has not gone to hell and been forced to live after it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and was i to go through that again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was i to love and care for and worship this child and have her grow up with all her mothers vanity and animal nature and have her turn on me some day and show me that what is bred in the bone must tell and that i was a fool againa pitiful fond fool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can never trust any woman or child again and least of all that womans child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is as dead to me as though she were buried with her mother and it is nothing to me what she is or what her life is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know in time what it will be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has begun earlier than i had supposed that is all but she is nothing to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man stopped and turned his back to van bibber and hid his head in his hands with his elbows on the mantelpiece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot let it mean anything to me when i do care it means so much more to me than to other men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they may pretend to laugh and to forget and to outgrow it but it is not so with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took a quick stride towards one of the armchairs and threw himself into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why man he cried i loved that childs mother to the day of her death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i loved that woman then and god help me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she writhes and twists about like a snake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the time she was here didnt you see george how she was acting at the general over the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hang it shes the nicest little woman in england george replied showing his white teeth and giving his ambrosial whiskers a twirl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you aint a man of the world dobbin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dammy look at her now shes talked over tufto in no time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> odowd said and both amelia and william dobbin thanked her for this timely observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but beyond this neither of the ladies rallied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amelia was overpowered by the flash and the dazzle and the fashionable talk of her worldly rival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the odowd was silent and subdued after beckys brilliant apparition and scarcely said a word more about glenmalony all the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when do you intend to give up play george as you have promised me any time these hundred years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dobbin said to his friend a few days after the night at the opera <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when do you intend to give up sermonising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the deuce man are you alarmed about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with fair play it comes to pretty much the same thing at the years end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont think he could pay if he lost dobbin said and his advice met with the success which advice usually commands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george was always welcome in the apartments very close indeed to those of the general which the aidedecamp and his wife occupied in the hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amelias manners were such when she and george visited crawley and his wife at these quarters that they had very nearly come to their first quarrel that is george scolded his wife violently for her evident unwillingness to go and the high and mighty manner in which she comported herself towards mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crawley her old friend and amelia did not say one single word in reply but with her husbands eye upon her and rebecca scanning her as she felt was if possible more bashful and awkward on the second visit which she paid to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rebecca was doubly affectionate of course and would not take notice in the least of her friends coolness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think emmy has become prouder since her fathers name was in thesince mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sedleys misfortunes rebecca said softening the phrase charitably for georges ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon my word i thought when we were at brighton she was doing me the honour to be jealous of me and now i suppose she is scandalised because rawdon and i and the general live together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why my dear creature how could we with our means live at all but for a friend to share expenses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and do you suppose that rawdon is not big enough to take care of my honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im very much obliged to emmy very mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> werent you jealous of general tufto and the general of you on the night of the opera <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why he was ready to eat me for going with you to visit that foolish little wife of yours as if i care a pin for either of you crawleys wife said with a pert toss of her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say the french have crossed the frontier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george accepted the invitation although his wife was a little ailing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were now not quite six weeks married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another woman was laughing or sneering at her expense and he not angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not even angry with himself this goodnatured fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a shame he owned to himself but hang it if a pretty woman will throw herself in your way why what can a fellow do you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am rather free about women he had often said smiling and nodding knowingly to stubble and spooney and other comrades of the messtable and they rather respected him than otherwise for this prowess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next to conquering in war conquering in love has been a source of pride time out of mind amongst men in vanity fair or how should schoolboys brag of their amours or don juan be popular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> osborne having a firm conviction in his own mind that he was a womankiller and destined to conquer did not run counter to his fate but yielded himself up to it quite complacently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as emmy did not say much or plague him with her jealousy but merely became unhappy and pined over it miserably in secret he chose to fancy that she was not suspicious of what all his acquaintance were perfectly awarenamely that he was carrying on a desperate flirtation with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rode with her whenever she was free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pretended regimental business to amelia by which falsehood she was not in the least deceived and consigning his wife to solitude or her brothers society passed his evenings in the crawleys company losing money to the husband and flattering himself that the wife was dying of love for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very likely that this worthy couple never absolutely conspired and agreed together in so many words the one to cajole the young gentleman whilst the other won his money at cards but they understood each other perfectly well and rawdon let osborne come and go with entire good humour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george was so occupied with his new acquaintances that he and william dobbin were by no means so much together as formerly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george avoided him in public and in the regiment and as we see did not like those sermons which his senior was disposed to inflict upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if some parts of his conduct made captain dobbin exceedingly grave and cool of what use was it to tell george that though his whiskers were large and his own opinion of his knowingness great he was as green as a schoolboy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that rawdon was making a victim of him as he had done of many before and as soon as he had used him would fling him off with scorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not listen and so as dobbin upon those days when he visited the sborne house seldom had the advantage of meeting his old friend much painful and unavailing talk between them was spared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our friend george was in the full career of the pleasures of vanity fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there never was since the days of darius such a brilliant train of campfollowers as hung round the duke of wellingtons army in the low countries in and led it dancing and feasting as it were up to the very brink of battle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain ball which a noble duchess gave at brussels on the th of june in the abovenamed year is historical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all brussels had been in a state of excitement about it and i have heard from ladies who were in that town at the period that the talk and interest of persons of their own sex regarding the ball was much greater even than in respect of the enemy in their front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the struggles intrigues and prayers to get tickets were such as only english ladies will employ in order to gain admission to the society of the great of their own nation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> odowd who were panting to be asked strove in vain to procure tickets but others of our friends were more lucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance through the interest of my lord bareacres and as a setoff for the dinner at the restaurateurs george got a card for captain and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dobbin who was a friend of the general commanding the division in which their regiment was came laughing one day to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> osborne and displayed a similar invitation which made jos envious and george wonder how the deuce he should be getting into society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rawdon finally were of course invited as became the friends of a general commanding a cavalry brigade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the appointed night george having commanded new dresses and ornaments of all sorts for amelia drove to the famous ball where his wife did not know a single soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after looking about for lady bareacres who cut him thinking the card was quite enoughand after placing amelia on a bench he left her to her own cogitations there thinking on his own part that he had behaved very handsomely in getting her new clothes and bringing her to the ball where she was free to amuse herself as she liked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her thoughts were not of the pleasantest and nobody except honest dobbin came to disturb them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whilst her appearance was an utter failure as her husband felt with a sort of rage mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rawdon crawleys debut was on the contrary very brilliant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the midst of the great persons assembled and the eye glasses directed to her rebecca seemed to be as cool and collected as when she used to marshal miss pinkertons little girls to church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> numbers of the men she knew already and the dandies thronged round her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the ladies it was whispered among them that rawdon had run away with her from out of a convent and that she was a relation of the montmorency family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spoke french so perfectly that there might be some truth in this report and it was agreed that her manners were fine and her air distingue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fifty wouldbe partners thronged round her at once and pressed to have the honour to dance with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she said she was engaged and only going to dance very little and made her way at once to the place where emmy sate quite unnoticed and dismally unhappy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so to finish the poor child at once mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rawdon ran and greeted affectionately her dearest amelia and began forthwith to patronise her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she found fault with her friends dress and her hairdresser and wondered how she could be so chaussee and vowed that she must send her corsetiere the next morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she vowed that it was a delightful ball that there was everybody that every one knew and only a very few nobodies in the whole room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a fact that in a fortnight and after three dinners in general society this young woman had got up the genteel jargon so well that a native could not speak it better and it was only from her french being so good that you could know she was not a born woman of fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george who had left emmy on her bench on entering the ballroom very soon found his way back when rebecca was by her dear friends side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> osborne upon the follies which her husband was committing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gods sake stop him from gambling my dear she said or he will ruin himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and rawdon are playing at cards every night and you know he is very poor and rawdon will win every shilling from him if he does not take care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont you prevent him you little careless creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont you come to us of an evening instead of moping at home with that captain dobbin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dare say he is tres aimable but how could one love a man with feet of such size <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is emmy crying her eyes out for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you coming to fetch me for the quadrille <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she left her bouquet and shawl by amelias side and tripped off with george to dance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a poison on the tips of their little shafts which stings a thousand times more than a mans blunter weapon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our poor emmy who had never hated never sneered all her life was powerless in the hands of her remorseless little enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george danced with rebecca twice or thricehow many times amelia scarcely knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat quite unnoticed in her corner except when rawdon came up with some words of clumsy conversation and later in the evening when captain dobbin made so bold as to bring her refreshments and sit beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not like to ask her why she was so sad but as a pretext for the tears which were filling in her eyes she told him that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crawley had alarmed her by telling her that george would go on playing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is curious when a man is bent upon play by what clumsy rogues he will allow himself to be cheated dobbin said and emmy said indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not the loss of the money that grieved her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last george came back for rebeccas shawl and flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not even condescend to come back and say goodbye to amelia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor girl let her husband come and go without saying a word and her head fell on her breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dobbin had been called away and was whispering deep in conversation with the general of the division his friend and had not seen this last parting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george went away then with the bouquet but when he gave it to the owner there lay a note coiled like a snake among the flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been used to deal with notes in early life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put out her hand and took the nosegay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw by her eyes as they met that she was aware what she should find there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her husband hurried her away still too intent upon his own thoughts seemingly to take note of any marks of recognition which might pass between his friend and his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rebecca gave george her hand with one of her usual quick knowing glances and made a curtsey and walked away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george bowed over the hand said nothing in reply to a remark of crawleys did not hear it even his brain was so throbbing with triumph and excitement and allowed them to go away without a word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife saw the one part at least of the bouquetscene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite natural that george should come at rebeccas request to get her her scarf and flowers it was no more than he had done twenty times before in the course of the last few days but now it was too much for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> william she said suddenly clinging to dobbin who was near her youve always been very kind to meim im not well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not know she called him by his christian name as george was accustomed to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her lodgings were hard by and they threaded through the crowd without where everything seemed to be more astir than even in the ballroom within <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george had been angry twice or thrice at finding his wife up on his return from the parties which he frequented so she went straight to bed now but although she did not sleep and although the din and clatter and the galloping of horsemen were incessant she never heard any of these noises having quite other disturbances to keep her awake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> osborne meanwhile wild with elation went off to a playtable and began to bet frantically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his luck at play even did not cure him of his restlessness and he started up after awhile pocketing his winnings and went to a buffet where he drank off many bumpers of wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here as he was rattling away to the people around laughing loudly and wild with spirits dobbin found him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been to the cardtables to look there for his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dobbin looked as pale and grave as his comrade was flushed and jovial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me some more you sir and he held out a trembling glass for the liquor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come out george said dobbin still gravely dont drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drink yourself and light up your lantern jaws old boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dobbin went up and whispered something to him at which george giving a start and a wild hurray tossed off his glass clapped it on the table and walked away speedily on his friends arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the enemy has passed the sambre william said and our left is already engaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> away went george his nerves quivering with excitement at the news so long looked for so sudden when it came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought about a thousand things but these in his rapid walk to his quartershis past life and future chancesthe fate which might be before himthe wife the child perhaps from whom unseen he might be about to part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how he wished that nights work undone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that with a clear conscience at least he might say farewell to the tender and guileless being by whose love he had set such little store <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in those few weeks he had frightfully dissipated his little capital <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should any mischance befall him what was then left for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why had he disobeyed his father who had been always so generous to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hope remorse ambition tenderness and selfish regret filled his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sate down and wrote to his father remembering what he had said once before when he was engaged to fight a duel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dawn faintly streaked the sky as he closed this farewell letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought how he had deserted that generous father and of the thousand kindnesses which the stern old man had done him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had looked into amelias bedroom when he entered she lay quiet and her eyes seemed closed and he was glad that she was asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on arriving at his quarters from the ball he had found his regimental servant already making preparations for his departure the man had understood his signal to be still and these arrangements were very quickly and silently made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should he go in and wake amelia he thought or leave a note for her brother to break the news of departure to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went in to look at her once again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been awake when he first entered her room but had kept her eyes closed so that even her wakefulness should not seem to reproach him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when he had returned so soon after herself too this timid little heart had felt more at ease and turning towards him as he stept softly out of the room she had fallen into a light sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george came in and looked at her again entering still more softly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the pale nightlamp he could see her sweet pale facethe purple eyelids were fringed and closed and one round arm smooth and white lay outside of the coverlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how pure she was how gentle how tender and how friendless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he how selfish brutal and black with crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heartstained and shamestricken he stood at the beds foot and looked at the sleeping girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how dared hewho was he to pray for one so spotless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came to the bedside and looked at the hand the little soft hand lying asleep and he bent over the pillow noiselessly towards the gentle pale face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two fair arms closed tenderly round his neck as he stooped down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am awake george the poor child said with a sob fit to break the little heart that nestled so closely by his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was awake poor soul and to what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that moment a bugle from the place of arms began sounding clearly and was taken up through the town and amidst the drums of the infantry and the shrill pipes of the scotch the whole city awoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl i left behind me we do not claim to rank among the military novelists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the decks are cleared for action we go below and wait meekly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we should only be in the way of the manoeuvres that the gallant fellows are performing overhead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall go no farther with the th than to the city gate and leaving major odowd to his duty come back to the majors wife and the ladies and the baggage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the major and his lady who had not been invited to the ball at which in our last chapter other of our friends figured had much more time to take their wholesome natural rest in bed than was accorded to people who wished to enjoy pleasure as well as to do duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my belief peggy my dear said he as he placidly pulled his nightcap over his ears that there will be such a ball danced in a day or two as some of em has never heard the chune of and he was much more happy to retire to rest after partaking of a quiet tumbler than to figure at any other sort of amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggy for her part would have liked to have shown her turban and bird of paradise at the ball but for the information which her husband had given her and which made her very grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id like ye wake me about half an hour before the assembly beats the major said to his lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> call me at half past one peggy dear and see me things is ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may be ill not come back to breakfast mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with which words which signified his opinion that the regiment would march the next morning the major ceased talking and fell asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> odowd the good housewife arrayed in curl papers and a camisole felt that her duty was to act and not to sleep at this juncture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time enough for that she said when micks gone and so she packed his travelling valise ready for the march brushed his cloak his cap and other warlike habiliments set them out in order for him and stowed away in the cloak pockets a light package of portable refreshments and a wickercovered flask or pocketpistol containing near a pint of a remarkably sound cognac brandy of which she and the major approved very much and as soon as the hands of the repayther pointed to halfpast one and its interior arrangements it had a tone quite equal to a cathaydral its fair owner considered knelled forth that fatal hour mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> odowd woke up her major and had as comfortable a cup of coffee prepared for him as any made that morning in brussels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and who is there will deny that this worthy ladys preparations betokened affection as much as the fits of tears and hysterics by which more sensitive females exhibited their love and that their partaking of this coffee which they drank together while the bugles were sounding the turnout and the drums beating in the various quarters of the town was not more useful and to the purpose than the outpouring of any mere sentiment could be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the consequence was that the major appeared on parade quite trim fresh and alert his wellshaved rosy countenance as he sate on horseback giving cheerfulness and confidence to the whole corps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the officers saluted her when the regiment marched by the balcony on which this brave woman stood and waved them a cheer as they passed and i daresay it was not from want of courage but from a sense of female delicacy and propriety that she refrained from leading the gallant th personally into action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on sundays and at periods of a solemn nature mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> odowd used to read with great gravity out of a large volume of her uncle the deans sermons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been of great comfort to her on board the transport as they were coming home and were very nearly wrecked on their return from the west indies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the regiments departure she betook herself to this volume for meditation perhaps she did not understand much of what she was reading and her thoughts were elsewhere but the sleep project with poor micks nightcap there on the pillow was quite a vain one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack or donald marches away to glory with his knapsack on his shoulder stepping out briskly to the tune of the girl i left behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is she who remains and suffersand has the leisure to think and brood and remember <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knowing how useless regrets are and how the indulgence of sentiment only serves to make people more miserable mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rebecca wisely determined to give way to no vain feelings of sorrow and bore the parting from her husband with quite a spartan equanimity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed captain rawdon himself was much more affected at the leave taking than the resolute little woman to whom he bade farewell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had mastered this rude coarse nature and he loved and worshipped her with all his faculties of regard and admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all his life he had never been so happy as during the past few months his wife had made him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all former delights of turf mess huntingfield and gamblingtable all previous loves and courtships of milliners operadancers and the like easy triumphs of the clumsy military adonis were quite insipid when compared to the lawful matrimonial pleasures which of late he had enjoyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had known perpetually how to divert him and he had found his house and her society a thousand times more pleasant than any place or company which he had ever frequented from his childhood until now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he cursed his past follies and extravagances and bemoaned his vast outlying debts above all which must remain for ever as obstacles to prevent his wifes advancement in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had often groaned over these in midnight conversations with rebecca although as a bachelor they had never given him any disquiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hang it he would say or perhaps use a still stronger expression out of his simple vocabulary before i was married i didnt care what bills i put my name to and so long as moses would wait or levy would renew for three months i kept on never minding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but since im married except renewing of course i give you my honour ive not touched a bit of stamped paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rebecca always knew how to conjure away these moods of melancholy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why my stupid love she would say we have not done with your aunt yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she fails us isnt there what you call the gazette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or stop when your uncle butes life drops i have another scheme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the living has always belonged to the younger brother and why shouldnt you sell out and go into the church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of this conversion set rawdon into roars of laughter you might have heard the explosion through the hotel at midnight and the hawhaws of the great dragoons voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> general tufto heard him from his quarters on the first floor above them and rebecca acted the scene with great spirit and preached rawdons first sermon to the immense delight of the general at breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but these were mere bygone days and talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the final news arrived that the campaign was opened and the troops were to march rawdons gravity became such that becky rallied him about it in a manner which rather hurt the feelings of the guardsman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont suppose im afraid becky i should think he said with a tremor in his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im a pretty good mark for a shot and you see if it brings me down why i leave one and perhaps two behind me whom i should wish to provide for as i brought em into the scrape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rebecca by a hundred caresses and kind words tried to soothe the feelings of the wounded lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only when her vivacity and sense of humour got the better of this sprightly creature as they would do under most circumstances of life indeed that she would break out with her satire but she could soon put on a demure face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dearest love she said do you suppose i feel nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hastily dashing something from her eyes she looked up in her husbands face with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i drop let us see what there is for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have had a pretty good run of luck here and heres two hundred and thirty pounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have got ten napoleons in my pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is as much as i shall want for the general pays everything like a prince and if im hit why you know i cost nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont cry little woman i may live to vex you yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i shant take either of my horses but shall ride the generals grey charger its cheaper and i told him mine was lame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if im done those two ought to fetch you something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grigg offered ninety for the mare yesterday before this confounded news came and like a fool i wouldnt let her go under the two os <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bullfinch will fetch his price any day only youd better sell him in this country because the dealers have so many bills of mine and so id rather he shouldnt go back to england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your little mare the general gave you will fetch something and theres no dd livery stable bills here as there are in london rawdon added with a laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres that dressingcase cost me two hundred that is i owe two for it and the gold tops and bottles must be worth thirty or forty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please to put that up the spout maam with my pins and rings and watch and chain and things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss crawley i know paid a hundred down for the chain and ticker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dammy im sorry i didnt take more now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edwards pressed on me a silver gilt bootjack and i might have had a dressingcase fitted up with a silver warmingpan and a service of plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we must make the best of what weve got becky you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so making his last dispositions captain crawley who had seldom thought about anything but himself until the last few months of his life when love had obtained the mastery over the dragoon went through the various items of his little catalogue of effects striving to see how they might be turned into money for his wifes benefit in case any accident should befall him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pleased himself by noting down with a pencil in his big schoolboy handwriting the various items of his portable property which might be sold for his widows advantage as for example my doublebarril by manton say guineas my driving cloak lined with sable fur pounds my duelling pistols in rosewood case same which i shot captain marker pounds my regulation saddleholsters and housings my laurie ditto and so forth over all of which articles he made rebecca the mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faithful to his plan of economy the captain dressed himself in his oldest and shabbiest uniform and epaulets leaving the newest behind under his wifes or it might be his widows guardianship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this famous dandy of windsor and hyde park went off on his campaign with a kit as modest as that of a sergeant and with something like a prayer on his lips for the woman he was leaving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took her up from the ground and held her in his arms for a minute tight pressed against his strongbeating heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was purple and his eyes dim as he put her down and left her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rode by his generals side and smoked his cigar in silence as they hastened after the troops of the generals brigade which preceded them and it was not until they were some miles on their way that he left off twirling his moustache and broke silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and rebecca as we have said wisely determined not to give way to unavailing sentimentality on her husbands departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she waved him an adieu from the window and stood there for a moment looking out after he was gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cathedral towers and the full gables of the quaint old houses were just beginning to blush in the sunrise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had been no rest for her that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was still in her pretty balldress her fair hair hanging somewhat out of curl on her neck and the circles round her eyes dark with watching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a fright i seem she said examining herself in the glass and how pale this pink makes one look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she divested herself of this pink raiment in doing which a note fell out from her corsage which she picked up with a smile and locked into her dressingbox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then she put her bouquet of the ball into a glass of water and went to bed and slept very comfortably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town was quite quiet when she woke up at ten oclock and partook of coffee very requisite and comforting after the exhaustion and grief of the mornings occurrences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this meal over she resumed honest rawdons calculations of the night previous and surveyed her position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should the worst befall all things considered she was pretty well to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were her own trinkets and trousseau in addition to those which her husband had left behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rawdons generosity when they were first married has already been described and lauded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides these and the little mare the general her slave and worshipper had made her many very handsome presents in the shape of cashmere shawls bought at the auction of a bankrupt french generals lady and numerous tributes from the jewellers shops all of which betokened her admirers taste and wealth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for tickers as poor rawdon called watches her apartments were alive with their clicking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for happening to mention one night that hers which rawdon had given to her was of english workmanship and went ill on the very next morning there came to her a little bijou marked leroy with a chain and cover charmingly set with turquoises and another signed brequet which was covered with pearls and yet scarcely bigger than a halfcrown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> general tufto had bought one and captain osborne had gallantly presented the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> osborne had no watch though to do george justice she might have had one for the asking and the honourable mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tufto in england had an old instrument of her mothers that might have served for the platewarming pan which rawdon talked about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howell and james were to publish a list of the purchasers of all the trinkets which they sell how surprised would some families be and if all these ornaments went to gentlemens lawful wives and daughters what a profusion of jewellery there would be exhibited in the genteelest homes of vanity fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rebecca found not without a pungent feeling of triumph and self satisfaction that should circumstances occur she might reckon on six or seven hundred pounds at the very least to begin the world with and she passed the morning disposing ordering looking out and locking up her properties in the most agreeable manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the notes in rawdons pocketbook was a draft for twenty pounds on osbornes banker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will go and get the draft cashed she said and pay a visit afterwards to poor little emmy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if this is a novel without a hero at least let us lay claim to a heroine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no man in the british army which has marched away not the great duke himself could be more cool or collected in the presence of doubts and difficulties than the indomitable little aidedecamps wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there was another of our acquaintances who was also to be left behind a noncombatant and whose emotions and behaviour we have therefore a right to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was our friend the excollector of boggley wollah whose rest was broken like other peoples by the sounding of the bugles in the early morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being a great sleeper and fond of his bed it is possible he would have snoozed on until his usual hour of rising in the forenoon in spite of all the drums bugles and bagpipes in the british army but for an interruption which did not come from george osborne who shared joss quarters with him and was as usual occupied too much with his own affairs or with grief at parting with his wife to think of taking leave of his slumbering brotherinlawit was not george we say who interposed between jos sedley and sleep but captain dobbin who came and roused him up insisting on shaking hands with him before his departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very kind of you said jos yawning and wishing the captain at the deuce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ii didnt like to go off without saying goodbye you know dobbin said in a very incoherent manner because you know some of us maynt come back again and i like to see you all well andand that sort of thing you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain did not in the least hear him or look at the stout gentleman in the nightcap about whom he professed to have such a tender interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hypocrite was looking and listening with all his might in the direction of georges apartments striding about the room upsetting the chairs beating the tattoo biting his nails and showing other signs of great inward emotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jos had always had rather a mean opinion of the captain and now began to think his courage was somewhat equivocal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is it i can do for you dobbin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you what you can do the captain replied coming up to the bed we march in a quarter of an hour sedley and neither george nor i may ever come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mind you you are not to stir from this town until you ascertain how things go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are to stay here and watch over your sister and comfort her and see that no harm comes to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anything happens to george remember she has no one but you in the world to look to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it goes wrong with the army youll see her safe back to england and you will promise me on your word that you will never desert her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you wont as far as money goes you were always free enough with that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean have you enough gold to take you back to england in case of a misfortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir said jos majestically when i want money i know where to ask for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as for my sister you neednt tell me how i ought to behave to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you speak like a man of spirit jos the other answered goodnaturedly and i am glad that george can leave her in such good hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i may give him your word of honour may i that in case of extremity you will stand by her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jos whose generosity in money matters dobbin estimated quite correctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youll see her safe out of brussels in the event of a defeat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont try and frighten me the hero cried from his bed and dobbins mind was thus perfectly set at ease now that jos had spoken out so resolutely respecting his conduct to his sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least thought the captain there will be a retreat secured for her in case the worst should ensue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if captain dobbin expected to get any personal comfort and satisfaction from having one more view of amelia before the regiment marched away his selfishness was punished just as such odious egotism deserved to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so they did for as th good evening said petru as he entered the house and seatin himself near the fire listened comfortably to whatever th goddess might choose to talk about which was for the most par the wickedness of men with whom she was evidently very angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but petru agreed with her in everything as he had been taugh but was anybody ever so old as she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know why petr devoured her so with his eyes unless it was to count th wrinkles on her face but if so he would have had to live seve lives and each life seven times the length of an ordinary one but venus was joyful in her heart when she saw petrus eyes fixe nothing was that is and the world was not a world when i wa born said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i grew up and the world came into being everyone thought i was the most beautiful girl that ever wa seen though many hated me for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but every hundred years ther came a wrinkle on my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she went o to tell petru that she was the daughter of an emperor and thei nearest neighbour was the fairy of the dawn with whom she had violent quarrel and with that she broke out into loud abuse o petru did not know what to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened in silence for th most part but now and then he would say yes yes you mus have been badly treated just for politeness sake what mor i will give you a task to perform for you are brave and wil carry it through continued venus when she had talked a lon time and both of them were getting sleepy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> close to th fairys house is a well and whoever drinks from it will blosso again like a rose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bring me a flagon of it and i will d anything to prove my gratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one know that better than i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kingdom is guarded on every side b wild beasts and horrible dragons but i will tell you more abou that and i also have something to give you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she rose an lifted the lid of an ironbound chest and took out of it a ver do you see this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an old man gave it to me when was young whoever listens to this flute goes to sleep an nothing can wake him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take it and play on it as long as yo remain in the kingdom of the fairy of the dawn and you will b at this petru told her that he had another task to fulfil at th well of the fairy of the dawn and venus was still better please so petru bade her goodnight put the flute in its case and lai before the dawn he was awake again and his first care was t give to each of his horses as much corn as he could eat and the to lead them to the well to water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he dressed himself an stop cried venus from her window i have still a piece o advice to give you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leave one of your horses here and only tak three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ride slowly till you get to the fairys kingdom the dismount and go on foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you return see that all you three horses remain on the road while you walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but above al beware never to look the fairy of the dawn in the face for sh she is hideous more hideous than anything you can imagine wit owls eyes foxy face and cats claws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far far away where the heavens touch the earth where the star kiss the flowers a soft red light was seen such as the sk that light was behind the palace of the fairy of the dawn and i took petru two days and nights through flowery meadows to reac it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besides it was neither hot nor cold bright nor dark but something of them all and petru did not find the way a ste after some time petru saw something white rise up out of the re of the sky and when he drew nearer he saw it was a castle an so splendid that his eyes were dazzled when they looked at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no time was to be lost so he shook himself jumped down fro his horse and leaving him on the dewy grass began to play o he had hardly gone many steps when he stumbled over a huge giant who had been lulled to sleep by the music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was one of th guards of the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he lay there on his back he seemed s the further went petru the more strange and terrible were th sights he sawlions tigers dragons with seven heads al stretched out in the sun fast asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is needless to say wha the dragons were like for nowadays everyone knows and dragon are not things to joke about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petru ran through them like th at last he came to a river but let nobody think for a momen that this river was like other rivers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of water ther flowed milk and the bottom was of precious stones and pearls instead of sand and pebbles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it ran neither fast nor slow but both fast and slow together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the river flowed round th castle and on its banks slept lions with iron teeth and claws and beyond were gardens such as only the fairy of the dawn ca have and on the flowers slept a fairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this saw petru fro but how was he to get over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be sure there was a bridge but even if it had not been guarded by sleeping lions it was plainl not meant for man to walk on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who could tell what it was mad after a while he determined to take the risk and strode back t the sleeping giant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried givin the giant woke and stretched out his hand to pick up petru jus as we should catch a fly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but petru played on his flute and th giant fell back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petru tried this three times and when h was satisfied that the giant was really in his power he took ou a handkerchief bound the two little fingers of the gian together drew his sword and cried for the fourth time wak up my brave man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the giant saw the trick which had been played on him he sai to petru <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fight according t rules if you really are a hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will byandby but first i want to ask you a question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wil you swear that you will carry me over the river if i figh when his hands were freed the giant flung himself upon petru hoping to crush him by his weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not yesterday nor the day before that petru had fought hi for three days and three nights the battle raged and sometime one had the upper hand and sometimes the other till at lengt they both lay struggling on the ground but petru was on top let me go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what shall i do to you if you break your word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well said petru and he bound the giants left hand t his right foot tied one handkerchief round his mouth to preven him crying out and another round his eyes and led him to th once they had reached the bank he stretched one leg over to th other side and catching up petru in the palm of his hand se that is all right said petru <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he played a few notes o his flute and the giant went to sleep again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the fairie who had been bathing a little lower down heard the music and fel asleep among the flowers on the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petru saw them as h passed and thought if they are so beautiful why should th fairy of the dawn be so ugly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he dared not linger an and now he was in the wonderful gardens which seemed mor wonderful still than they had done from afar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but petru coul see no faded flowers nor any birds as he hastened through the to the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one was there to bar his way for all wer what he beheld there need not be told for all the world know that the palace of the fairy of the dawn is no ordinary place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gold and precious stones were as common as wood with us and th stables where the horses of the sun were kept were more splendi petru went up the stairs and walked quickly throug eightandforty rooms hung with silken stuffs and all empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle of this room which was as large as a church petr saw the celebrated well that he had come so far to seek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wa a well just like other wells and it seemed strange that th fairy of the dawn should have it in her own chamber yet anyon could tell it had been there for hundreds of years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by th and as petru looked at her the magic flute dropped by his side near the well was a table on which stood bread made with does milk and a flagon of wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the bread of strength and th wine of youth and petru longed for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i have to laugh to think i should have forgot the husbands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll have to be worked into the story certain but itll be considable of a chore for i cant make flowers out of coat and pants stuff and there aint any more flowers on this branch anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> diadema sat for a few minutes in rapt thought and then made a sudden inspired dash upstairs where miss hollis presently heard her rummaging in an old chest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> want it a providence i saved jots and reubens wedding ties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here they areone yellow and green mixed and one brown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know what im going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to draw in a butterfly hovering over them two roses and make it out of the neckties green with brown spots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt have either of em know it for the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill take a pattern of that lunar moth you pinned on the curtain yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have some very ingenious ideas and some very pretty thoughts mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the first time i ever heard tell of it said diadema cheerfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lovey was the prettyspoken prettyappearing one i was always plain and practical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while i think of it ill draw in a little mite of this red into my carnation pink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a red scarf reuben brought lovey from portland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first thing he ever give her and aunt hitty said if one of the abel grangers give away anything that cost money it meant business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was all folderol for there never was a more liberal husband though he was a poor minister but then they always are poor without theyre rich there dont seem to be any halfway in ministers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there aint a stingy bone in jot bascoms body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dont make much money but what he does make goes into the bureau drawer and the one that needs it most takes it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never asks me what i done with the last five cents he give me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ve never been married miss hollis and you aint engaged so you dont know much about it but i tell you there s a heap o foolishness talked about husbands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you get the one you like yourself i dont know as it matters if all the other women folks in town dont happen to like him as well as you do they aint called on to do that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they see the face he turns to them not the one he turns to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jot aint a very good provider nor he aint a man that s much use round a farm but he s such a favrite i cant blame him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there s one thing when he does come home he s got something to say and he s always as lively as a cricket and smiling as a basket of chips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like a man that s good compny even if he aint so forehanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there aint anything specially lovable about forehandedness when you come to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt ever feel drawed to a man because he was on time with his work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he s got such pleasant ways jot has <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other afternoon he didnt get home early enough to milk and after i done the two cows i split the kindling and brought in the wood for i knew he d want to go to the tavern and tell the boys bout the robbery up to boylston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there aint anybody but jot in this village that has wit enough to find out what s going on and tell it in an intresting way round the tavern fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he can do it without being full of cider too he dont need any apple juice to limber his tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well when he come in he see the pails of milk and the full woodbox and the supper laid out under the screen cloth on the kitchen table and he come up to me at the sink and says he diademy you re the best wife in this county and the brightest jewel in my crownthat s what you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got that idea out of a duet he sings with almiry berry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now id like to know whether that aint pleasanter than t is to have a man do all the shed n barn work up smart and then set round the stove looking as doleful as a last years birds nest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take my advice miss hollis get a good provider if you can but anyhow try to find you a husband thatll keep on courting a little now and then when he aint too busy it smooths things considable round the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there i got so intrested in what i was saying ive went on and finished the carnation and some of the stem too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the thing that happened next of course and that was little jot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could just hear chairs being moved inside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had almost decided to go back when suddenly two figures appeared at the window not six feet from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was maurice fielding of course that your mother was engaged to said helens voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spoke reflectively looking out into the dark garden and thinking evidently as much of the look of the night as of what she was saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hewets heart leapt and he noticed the fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her voice though low was full of surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never knew thered been any one else said rachel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was clearly surprised but all they said was said low and inexpressively because they were speaking out into the cool dark night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more people were in love with her than with any one ive ever known helen stated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wasnt beautiful buti was thinking of her last night at the dance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she got on with every kind of person and then she made it all so amazinglyfunny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeared that helen was going back into the past choosing her words deliberately comparing theresa with the people she had known since theresa died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how she did it she continued and ceased and there was a long pause in which a little owl called first here then there as it moved from tree to tree in the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats so like aunt lucy and aunt katie said rachel at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they always make out that she was very sad and very good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then why for goodness sake did they do nothing but criticize her when she was alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very gentle their voices sounded as if they fell through the waves of the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were to die tomorrow she began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the broken sentences had an extraordinary beauty and detachment in hewets ears and a kind of mystery too as though they were spoken by people in their sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no rachel helens voice continued im not going to walk in the garden its dampits sure to be damp besides i see at least a dozen toads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apparently rachel tried to pull helen out on to the terrace and helen resisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a certain amount of scuffling entreating resisting and laughter from both of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hewet could not hear what they were all saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a minute they had gone in he could hear bolts grating then there was dead silence and all the lights went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned away still crumpling and uncrumpling a handful of leaves which he had torn from the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an exquisite sense of pleasure and relief possessed him it was all so solid and peaceful after the ball at the hotel whether he was in love with them or not and he was not in love with them no but it was good that they should be alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after standing still for a minute or two he turned and began to walk towards the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the movement of his body the excitement the romance and the richness of life crowded into his brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shouted out a line of poetry but the words escaped him and he stumbled among lines and fragments of lines which had no meaning at all except for the beauty of the words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shut the gate and ran swinging from side to side down the hill shouting any nonsense that came into his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here am i he cried rhythmically as his feet pounded to the left and to the right plunging along like an elephant in the jungle stripping the branches as i go he snatched at the twigs of a bush at the roadside roaring innumerable words lovely words about innumerable things running downhill and talking nonsense aloud to myself about roads and leaves and lights and women coming out into the darknessabout women about rachel about rachel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night seemed immense and hospitable and although so dark there seemed to be things moving down there in the harbour and movement out at sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gazed until the darkness numbed him and then he walked on quickly still murmuring to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i ought to be in bed snoring and dreaming dreaming dreaming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dreams and realities dreams and realities dreams and realities he repeated all the way up the avenue scarcely knowing what he said until he reached the front door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he paused for a second and collected himself before he opened the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes were dazed his hands very cold and his brain excited and yet half asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inside the door everything was as he had left it except that the hall was now empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were the chairs turning in towards each other where people had sat talking and the empty glasses on little tables and the newspapers scattered on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he shut the door he felt as if he were enclosed in a square box and instantly shrivelled up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all very bright and very small <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped for a minute by the long table to find a paper which he had meant to read but he was still too much under the influence of the dark and the fresh air to consider carefully which paper it was or where he had seen it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he fumbled vaguely among the papers he saw a figure cross the tail of his eye coming downstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard the swishing sound of skirts and to his great surprise evelyn m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> came up to him laid her hand youre just the person i wanted to talk to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her voice was a little unpleasant and metallic her eyes were very bright and she kept them fixed upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i think you understand better than most people she answered and sat down on a little chair placed beside a big leather chair so that hewet had to sit down beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not believe that this was really happening to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you really sympathetic or is it just a pose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still felt numb all over and as if she was much too close to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you look as if youd got a nice sister somehow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused picking at some sequins on her knees and then as if she had made up her mind she started off anyhow im going to ask your advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dyou ever get into a state where you dont know your own mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see last night at the dance raymond oliverhes the tall dark boy who looks as if he had indian blood in him but he says hes not reallywell we were sitting out together and he told me all about himself how unhappy he is at home and how he hates being out here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyve put him into some beastly mining business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says its beastlyi should like it i know but thats neither here nor there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i felt awfully sorry for him one couldnt help being sorry for him and when he asked me to let him kiss me i did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see any harm in that do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then this morning he said hed thought i meant something more and i wasnt the sort to let any one kiss me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i daresay i was very silly but one cant help liking people when ones sorry for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do like him most awfully she paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i gave him half a promise and then you see theres alfred perrott <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got to know each other on that picnic the other day she continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed so lonely especially as arthur had gone off with susan and one couldnt help guessing what was in his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we had quite a long talk when you were looking at the ruins and he told me all about his life and his struggles and how fearfully hard it had been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dyou know he was a boy in a grocers shop and took parcels to peoples houses in a basket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that interested me awfully because i always say it doesnt matter how youre born if youve got the right stuff in you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he told me about his sister whos paralysed poor girl and one can see shes a great trial though hes evidently very devoted to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must say i do admire people like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont expect you do because youre so clever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well last night we sat out in the garden together and i couldnt help seeing what he wanted to say and comforting him a little and telling him i did carei really doonly then theres raymond oliver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i want you to tell me is can one be in love with two people at once or cant one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she became silent and sat with her chin on her hands looking very intent as if she were facing a real problem which had to be discussed between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think it depends what sort of person you are said hewet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was small and pretty aged perhaps twentyeight or twentynine but though dashing and sharply cut her features expressed nothing very clearly except a great deal of spirit and good health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who are you what are you you see i know nothing about you he continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i was coming to that said evelyn m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued to rest her chin on her hands and to look intently ahead of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im the daughter of a mother and no father if that interests you she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not a very nice thing to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a farmers daughter and he was rather a swell the young man up at the great house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never made things straight never married herthough he allowed us quite a lot of money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mother wasnt the sort of woman who could keep him straight anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say great big troopers broke down and cried over his body on the battlefield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mother had all the life crushed out of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh people can be horrid to a woman like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well she said dyou want to know any more about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would you do if you liked two people both of them tremendously and you couldnt tell which most <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should go on liking themi should wait and see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but one has to make up ones mind said evelyn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or are you one of the people who doesnt believe in marriages and all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look herethis isnt fair i do all the telling and you tell nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps youre the same as your friendshe looked at him suspiciously perhaps you dont like me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know when i like a person directly i see them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew i liked you the very first night at dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh dear she continued impatiently what a lot of bother would be saved if only people would say the things they think straight out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dont you find it leads to difficulties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so youve gone on having one proposal after another said hewet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont suppose ive had more proposals than most women said evelyn but she spoke without conviction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evelyn seemed to intimate that perhaps ten was the right figure but that it really was not a high one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe youre thinking me a heartless flirt she protested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care what any one thinks of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just because ones interested and likes to be friends with men and talk to them as one talks to women ones called a flirt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but miss murgatroyd i wish youd call me evelyn she interrupted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after ten proposals do you honestly think that men are the same as women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every time one thinks its not going to happen and every time it does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us consider he paused because for the moment he could not remember what it was that they had to consider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was far more interested in her than in her story for as she went on speaking his numbness had disappeared and he was conscious of a mixture of liking pity and distrust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve promised to marry both oliver and perrott <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant make up my mind which i really like best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must have been so much easier for the elizabethans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought the other day on that mountain how id have liked to be one of those colonists to cut down trees and make laws and all that instead of fooling about with all these people who think ones just a pretty young lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid right down in my heart that alfred perrot wont do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps he couldnt cut down a tree said hewet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sea however is said to be blue one day and green another without any perceptible change in the atmosphere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen our river when the landscape being covered with snow both water and ice were almost as green as grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some consider blue to be the color of pure water whether liquid or solid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but looking directly down into our waters from a boat they are seen to be of very different colors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> walden is blue at one time and green at another even from the same point of view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lying between the earth and the heavens it partakes of the color of both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> viewed from a hilltop it reflects the color of the sky but near at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the sand then a light green which gradually deepens to a uniform dark green in the body of the pond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in some lights viewed even from a hilltop it is of a vivid green next the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some have referred this to the reflection of the verdure but it is equally green there against the railroad sandbank and in the spring before the leaves are expanded and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is that portion also where in the spring the ice being warmed by the heat of the sun reflected from the bottom and also transmitted through the earth melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen middle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the rest of our waters when much agitated in clear weather so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the right angle or because there is more light mixed with it it appears at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself and at such a time being on its surface and looking with divided vision so as to see the reflection i have discerned a matchless and indescribable light blue such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades suggest more cerulean than the sky itself alternating with the original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves which last appeared but muddy in comparison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a vitreous greenish blue as i remember it like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloud vistas in the west before sundown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet a single glass of its water held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is well known that a large plate of glass will have a green tint owing as the makers say to its body but a small piece of the same will be colorless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how large a body of walden water would be required to reflect a green tint i have never proved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water of our river is black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it and like that of most ponds imparts to the body of one bathing in it a yellowish tinge but this water is of such crystalline purity that the body of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness still more unnatural which as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal produces a monstrous effect making fit studies for a michael angelo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at the depth of twentyfive or thirty feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paddling over it you may see many feet beneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners perhaps only an inch long yet the former easily distinguished by their transverse bars and you think that they must be ascetic fish that find a subsistence there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once in the winter many years ago when i had been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel as i stepped ashore i tossed my axe back on to the ice but as if some evil genius had directed it it slid four or five rods directly into one of the holes where the water was twentyfive feet deep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of curiosity i lay down on the ice and looked through the hole until i saw the axe a little on one side standing on its head with its helve erect and gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond and there it might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off if i had not disturbed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> making another hole directly over it with an ice chisel which i had and cutting down the longest birch which i could find in the neighborhood with my knife i made a slipnoose which i attached to its end and letting it down carefully passed it over the knob of the handle and drew it by a line along the birch and so pulled the axe out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like pavingstones excepting one or two short sand beaches and is so steep that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your head and were it not for its remarkable transparency that would be the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is nowhere muddy and a casual observer would say that there were no weeds at all in it and of noticeable plants except in the little meadows recently overflowed which do not properly belong to it a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a bulrush nor even a lily yellow or white but only a few small heartleaves and potamogetons and perhaps a watertarget or two all which however a bather might not perceive and these plants are clean and bright like the element they grow in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stones extend a rod or two into the water and then the bottom is pure sand except in the deepest parts where there is usually a little sediment probably from the decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many successive falls and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even in midwinter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have one other pond just like this white pond in nine acre corner about two and a half miles westerly but though i am acquainted with most of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre i do not know a third of this pure and welllike character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> successive nations perchance have drank at admired and fathomed it and passed away and still its water is green and pellucid as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps on that spring morning when adam and eve were driven out of eden walden pond was already in existence and even then breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind and covered with myriads of ducks and geese which had not heard of the fall when still such pure lakes sufficed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even then it had commenced to rise and fall and had clarified its waters and colored them of the hue they now wear and obtained a patent of heaven to be the only walden pond in the world and distiller of celestial dews <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who knows in how many unremembered nations literatures this has been the castalian fountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or what nymphs presided over it in the golden age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a gem of the first water which concord wears in her coronet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of their footsteps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been surprised to detect encircling the pond even where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore a narrow shelflike path in the steep hillside alternately rising and falling approaching and receding from the waters edge as old probably as the race of man here worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters and still from time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of the pond in winter just after a light snow has fallen appearing as a clear undulating white line unobscured by weeds and twigs and very obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is hardly distinguishable close at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the snow reprints it as it were in clear white type altorelievo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ornamented grounds of villas which will one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pond rises and falls but whether regularly or not and within what period nobody knows though as usual many pretend to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is commonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer though not corresponding to the general wet and dryness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can remember when it was a foot or two lower and also when it was at least five feet higher than when i lived by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a narrow sandbar running into it with very deep water on one side on which i helped boil a kettle of chowder some six rods from the main shore about the year which it has not been possible to do for twentyfive years and on the other hand my friends used to listen with incredulity when i told them that a few years later i was accustomed to fish from a boat in a secluded cove in the woods fifteen rods from the only shore they knew which place was long since converted into a meadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the pond has risen steadily for two years and now in the summer of is just five feet higher than when i lived there or as high as it was thirty years ago and fishing goes on again in the meadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this makes a difference of level at the outside of six or seven feet and yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount and this overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this same summer the pond has begun to fall again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is remarkable that this fluctuation whether periodical or not appears thus to require many years for its accomplishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have observed one rise and a part of two falls and i expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will again be as low as i have ever known it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flints pond a mile eastward allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets and the smaller intermediate ponds also sympathize with walden and recently attained their greatest height at the same time with the latter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same is true as far as my observation goes of white pond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this rise and fall of walden at long intervals serves this use at least the water standing at this great height for a year or more though it makes it difficult to walk round it kills the shrubs and trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last rise pitch pines birches alders aspens and others and falling again leaves an unobstructed shore for unlike many ponds and all waters which are subject to a daily tide its shore is cleanest when the water is lowest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the side of the pond next my house a row of pitch pines fifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever and thus a stop put to their encroachments and their size indicates how many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore and thus the shore is shorn and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are the lips of the lake on which no beard grows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it licks its chaps from time to time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the water is at its height the alders willows and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water and to the height of three or four feet from the ground in the effort to maintain themselves and i have known the high blueberry bushes about the shore which commonly produce no fruit bear an abundant crop under these circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my townsmen have all heard the tradition the oldest people tell me that they heard it in their youth that anciently the indians were holding a powwow upon a hill here which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth and they used much profanity as the story goes though this vice is one of which the indians were never guilty and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank and only one old squaw named walden escaped and from her the pond was named <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has been conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very certain at any rate that once there was no pond here and now there is one and this indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom i have mentioned who remembers so well when he first came here with his diviningrod saw a thin vapor rising from the sward and the hazel pointed steadily downward and he concluded to dig a well here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one may picture too the sudden shifting of the attention the swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong towering heavenward turning the twi light to a palpable darkness a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims men and horses near it seen dimly running shrieking falling headlong shouts of dismay the guns suddenly abandoned men choking and writhing on the ground and the swift broadeningout of the opaque cone of smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then night and extinction nothing but a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of richmond and the disintegrating organism of government was with a last expiring effort rousing the population of london to the necessity of flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the greatest city in the world just as monday was dawningthe stream of flight rising swiftly to a torrent lash ing in a foaming tumult round the railway stations banked up into a horrible struggle about the shipping in the thames and hurrying by every available channel northward and east ward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by ten oclock the police organisation and by midday even the railway organisations were losing coherency losing shape and efficiency guttering softening running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the railway lines north of the thames and the south eastern people at cannon street had been warned by mid night on sunday and trains were being filled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people were fighting savagely for standingroom in the carriages even at two oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by three people were being trampled and crushed even in bishopsgate street a couple of hundred yards or more from liverpool street station revolvers were fired people stabbed and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic exhausted and infuriated were breaking the heads of the people they were called out to protect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return to london the pressure of the flight drove the people in an everthickening multitude away from the stations and along the northwardrunning roads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by mid day a martian had been seen at barnes and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the thames and across the flats of lambeth cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another bank drove over ealing and sur rounded a little island of survivors on castle hill alive but unable to escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a fruitless struggle to get aboard a northwestern train at chalk farmthe engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there ploughed through shrieking people and a dozen stalwart men fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnacemy brother emerged upon the chalk farm road dodged across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the front tire of the machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window but he got up and off notwithstanding with no further injury than a cut wrist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the steep foot of haverstock hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses and my brother struck into belsize road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he got out of the fury of the panic and skirting the edgware road reached edgware about seven fasting and wearied but well ahead of the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along the road people were standing in the roadway curious wondering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was passed by a number of cyclists some horsemen and two motor cars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mile from edgware the rim of the wheel broke and the machine became unridable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left it by the roadside and trudged through the village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were shops half opened in the main street of the place and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and windows staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he succeeded in getting some food at an inn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time he remained in edgware not knowing what next to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many of them like my brother seemed inclined to loiter in the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no fresh news of the invaders from mars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that time the road was crowded but as yet far from congested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles but there were soon motor cars hansom cabs and carriages hurrying along and the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to chelms ford where some friends of his lived that at last induced my brother to strike into a quiet lane running eastward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently he came upon a stile and crossing it followed a footpath northeastward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he passed near several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw few fugitives until in a grass lane towards high barnet he hap pened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came upon them just in time to save them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard their screams and hurrying round the corner saw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little ponychaise in which they had been driving while a third with difficulty held the frightened ponys head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the ladies a short woman dressed in white was simply screaming the other a dark slender figure slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my brother immediately grasped the situation shouted and hurried towards the struggle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the men desisted and turned towards him and my brother realising from his an tagonists face that a fight was unavoidable and being an expert boxer went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of the chaise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender ladys arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in our dear free and easygoing country there is a constant tendency to loosen the ties of fireside etiquette until any manners are thought good enough as any toilet is considered sufficiently attractive for home use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a singular impression has grown up that formal politeness and the saying of gracious and complimentary things betray the toady and the hypocrite both if whom are abhorrent to americans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the force of circumstances most people are civil enough in general society while many fail to keep to their high standard in the intimacy of home life and in their intercourse with inferiors which is a pity as these are the two cases where selfrestraint and amenity are most required <end> <end> 
<start> <start> politeness is after all but the dictate of a kind heart and supplies the oil necessary to make the social machinery run smoothly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in home life which is the association during many hours each day of people of varying dispositions views and occupations friction is inevitable and there is especial need of lubrication to lessen the wear and tear and eliminate jarring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> americans are always much shocked to learn that we are not popular on the continent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a discovery comes to either a nation or an individual like a douche of cold water on nice warm conceit and brings with it a feeling of discouragement of being unjustly treated that is painful for we are very touchy in america and cry out when a foreigner expresses anything but admiration for our ways yet we are the last to lend ourselves to foreign customs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has been a home thrust for many of us to find that our dear friends the french sympathized warmly with spain in the recent struggle and had little but sneers for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the reasons for this partiality is not hard to discover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spanish who travel are mostly members of an aristocracy celebrated for its grave courtesy which has gone a long way toward making them popular on the continent while we have for years been riding roughshod over the feelings and prejudices of the european peoples under the pleasing but fallacious illusion that the money we spent so lavishly in foreign lands would atone for all our sins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the large majority of our travelling compatriots forget that an elaborate etiquette exists abroad regulating the intercourse between one class and another the result of centuries of civilization and as the medic and persian laws for durability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in our ignorance we break many of these social laws and give offence where none was intended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a young american girl once went to the mistress of a pension where she was staying and complained that the concierge of the house had been impertinent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the proprietress asked the concierge what this meant the latter burst out with her wrongs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has been in this house she has never once bowed to me or addressed a word to either my husband or myself that was not a question or an order she walks in and out of my loge to look for letters or take her key as though my room were the street i wont stand such treatment from any one much less from a girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the duchess who lives au quatrieme never passes without a kind word or an inquiry after the children or my health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this american girl had erred through ignorance of the fact that in france servants are treated as humble friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man who brings your matutinal coffee says good morning on entering the room and inquires if monsieur has slept well expecting to be treated with the same politeness he shows to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady who sits at the caisse of the restaurant you frequent is as sure of her position as her customers are of theirs and exacts a courteous salutation from every one entering or leaving her presence logically for no gentleman would enter a ladies drawingroom without removing his hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact that a woman is obliged to keep a shop in no way relieves him of this obligation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people on the continent know their friends servants by name and speak to them on arriving at a house and thank them for an opened door or offered coat if a tip is given it is accompanied by a gracious word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so rare is this form of civility in america and england for britons err as gravely in this matter as ourselves that our servants are surprised and inclined to resent politeness as in the case of an english butler who recently came to his master and said he should be obliged to leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on being questioned it came out that one of the guests was in the habit of chatting with him and added the briton i wont stand being took liberties with by no one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some years ago i happened to be standing in the vestibule of the hotel bristol as the princess of wales and her daughters were leaving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morlock the proprietor was at the foot of the stairs to take leave of those ladies who shook hands with and thanked him for his attention during their stay and for the flowers he had sent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing could have been more gracious and freer from condescension than their manner and it undoubtedly produced the best impression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the waiter who served me at that time was also under their charm and remarked several times that there had never been ladies so easy to please or so considerate of the servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my neighbor at dinner the other evening confided to me that she was worn out being fitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had such an unpleasant experience this morning she added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jupiere could not get one of my skirts to hang properly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a dozen attempts i told her to send for the forewoman when to my horror the girl burst out crying and said she should lose her place if i did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was very sorry for her but what else could i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it does not seem as if that lady could be very popular with inferiors does it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it needs a lighter hand and more tact to deal with tradespeople than with equals is certain and we are sure to be the losers when we fail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last time i was in the east a friend took me into the bazaars to see a carpet he was anxious to buy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the price asked was out of all proportion to its value but we were gravely invited by the merchant to be seated and coffee was served that bargaining which is the backbone of oriental trade might be carried on at leisure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friend nervous and impatient like all our race turned to me and said whats all this tomfoolery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him ill give so much for his carpet he can take it or leave it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when this was interpreted to the bearded tradesman he smiled and came down a few dollars in his price and ordered more coffee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time we were outside his shop and left without the carpet simply because my friend could not conform to the customs of the country he was visiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these four brothers were united by a close bond the bond of that mutual admiration or rather mutual heroworship which is so strong among the members of secluded families who have much ability and little culture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hob who had as much poetry as the tongs professed to find pleasure in dands verses clem who had no more religion than claverhouse nourished a heartfelt at least an openmouthed admiration of gibs prayers and dandie followed with relish the rise of clems fortunes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indulgence followed hard on the heels of admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the laird clem and dand who were tories and patriots of the hottest quality excused to themselves with a certain bashfulness the radical and revolutionary heresies of gib <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by another division of the family the laird clem and gib who were men exactly virtuous swallowed the dose of dands irregularities as a kind of clog or drawback in the mysterious providence of god affixed to bards and distinctly probative of poetical genius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to appreciate the simplicity of their mutual admiration it was necessary to hear clem arrived upon one of his visits and dealing in a spirit of continuous irony with the affairs and personalities of that great city of glasgow where he lived and transacted business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the various personages ministers of the church municipal officers mercantile bigwigs whom he had occasion to introduce were all alike denigrated all served but as reflectors to cast back a flattering sidelight on the house of cauldstaneslap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the provost for whom clem by exception entertained a measure of respect he would liken to hob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he minds me o the laird there he would say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has some of hobs grand whunstane sense and the same way with him of steiking his mouth when hes no very pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hob all unconscious would draw down his upper lip and produce as if for comparison the formidable grimace referred to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> enochs kirk was thus briefly dismissed if he had but twa fingers o gibs he would waken them up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clem was a spy whom they had sent out into the world of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had come back with the good news that there was nobody to compare with the four black brothers no position that they would not adorn no official that it would not be well they should replace no interest of mankind secular or spiritual which would not immediately bloom under their supervision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the excuse of their folly is in two words scarce the breadth of a hair divided them from the peasantry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the measure of their sense is this that these symposia of rustic vanity were kept entirely within the family like some secret ancestral practice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the world their serious faces were never deformed by the suspicion of any simper of selfcontentment <end> <end>

<start> <start> it will be understood that not all this information was communicated by the aunt who had too much of the family failing herself to appreciate it thoroughly in others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as time went on archie began to observe an omission in the family chronicle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was named for me or my grandmother at least its the same thing returned the aunt and went on again about dand whom she secretly preferred by reason of his gallantries <end> <end>

<start> <start> glory to god i was never farer from here than crossmichael <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the portrait you drew in his absence and the intensity with which you mused upon it were new and unexpected incidents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they bespoke a sensibility somewhat too vivid but from which while subjected to the guidance of an understanding like yours there was nothing to dread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a more direct intercourse took place between you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i need not apologize for the solicitude which i entertained for your safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he that gifted me with perception of excellence compelled me to love it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the midst of danger and pain my contemplations have ever been cheered by your image <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every object in competition with you was worthless and trivial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no price was too great by which your safety could be purchased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for that end the sacrifice of ease of health and even of life would cheerfully have been made by me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what wonder then that i scrutinized the sentiments and deportment of this man with ceaseless vigilance that i watched your words and your looks when he was present and that i extracted cause for the deepest inquietudes from every token which you gave of having put your happiness into this mans keeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i recalled the various conversations in which the topics of love and marriage had been discussed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a woman young beautiful and independent it behoved you to have fortified your mind with just principles on this subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had not their rectitude and their firmness been attested by your treatment of that specious seducer dashwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these principles i was prone to believe exempted you from danger in this new state of things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not the last to pay my homage to the unrivalled capacity insinuation and eloquence of this man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have disguised but could never stifle the conviction that his eyes and voice had a witchcraft in them which rendered him truly formidable but i reflected on the ambiguous expression of his countenancean ambiguity which you were the first to remark on the cloud which obscured his character and on the suspicious nature of that concealment which he studied and concluded you to be safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i referred your conduct to some principle which had not been hitherto disclosed but which was reconcileable with those already known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not suffered to remain long in this suspence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one evening you may recollect i came to your house where it was my purpose as usual to lodge somewhat earlier than ordinary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spied a light in your chamber as i approached from the outside and on inquiring of judith was informed that you were writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as your kinsman and friend and fellowlodger i thought i had a right to be familiar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were in your chamber but your employment and the time were such as to make it no infraction of decorum to follow you thither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you did not perceive my entrance and i advanced softly till i was able to overlook your shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had gone thus far in error and had no power to recede <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how cautiously should we guard against the first inroads of temptation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that to pry into your papers was criminal but i reflected that no sentiment of yours was of a nature which made it your interest to conceal it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wrote much more than you permitted your friends to peruse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my curiosity was strong and i had only to throw a glance upon the paper to secure its gratification <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should never have deliberately committed an act like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slightest obstacle would have repelled me but my eye glanced almost spontaneously upon the paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i caught only parts of sentences but my eyes comprehended more at a glance because the characters were shorthand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lighted on the words summerhouse midnight and made out a passage which spoke of the propriety and of the effects to be expected from another interview <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this passed in less than a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then checked myself and made myself known to you by a tap upon your shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could pardon and account for some trifling alarm but your trepidation and blushes were excessive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you hurried the paper out of sight and seemed too anxious to discover whether i knew the contents to allow yourself to make any inquiries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered at these appearances of consternation but did not reason on them until i had retired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when alone these incidents suggested themselves to my reflections anew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to what scene or what interview i asked did you allude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your disappearance on a former evening my tracing you to the recess in the bank your silence on my first and second call your vague answers and invincible embarrassment when you at length ascended the hill i recollected with new surprize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain timidity and consciousness had generally attended you when this incident and this recess had been the subjects of conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay i imagined that the last time that adventure was mentioned which happened in the presence of carwin the countenance of the latter betrayed some emotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was an idea calculated to rouse every faculty to contemplation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an interview at that hour in this darksome retreat with a man of this mysterious but formidable character a clandestine interview and one which you afterwards endeavoured with so much solicitude to conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not measure his power or fathom his designs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he rifled from you the secret of your love and reconciled you to concealment and noctural meetings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i scarcely ever spent a night of more inquietude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ascertainment of this mans character and views seemed to be in the first place necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he openly preferred his suit to you we should have been impowered to make direct inquiries but since he had chosen this obscure path it seemed reasonable to infer that his character was exceptionable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it at least subjected us to the necessity of resorting to other means of information <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet the improbability that you should commit a deed of such rashness made me reflect anew upon the insufficiency of those grounds on which my suspicions had been built and almost to condemn myself for harbouring them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though it was mere conjecture that the interview spoken of had taken place with carwin yet two ideas occurred to involve me in the most painful doubts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this mans reasonings might be so specious and his artifices so profound that aided by the passion which you had conceived for him he had finally succeeded or his situation might be such as to justify the secrecy which you maintained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in neither case did my wildest reveries suggest to me that your honor had been forfeited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not talk with you on this subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the imputation was false its atrociousness would have justly drawn upon me your resentment and i must have explained by what facts it had been suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it were true no benefit would follow from the mention of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had chosen to conceal it for some reasons and whether these reasons were true or false it was proper to discover and remove them in the first place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally i acquiesced in the least painful supposition trammelled as it was with perplexities that carwin was upright and that if the reasons of your silence were known they would be found to be just <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to bring myself to regard carwin without terror and to acquiesce in the belief of your safety was impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet to put an end to my doubts seemed to be impracticable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if some light could be reflected on the actual situation of this man a direct path would present itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he were contrary to the tenor of his conversation cunning and malignant to apprize you of this would be to place you in security <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he were merely unfortunate and innocent most readily would i espouse his cause and if his intentions were upright with regard to you most eagerly would i sanctify your choice by my approbation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be vain to call upon carwin for an avowal of his deeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was better to know nothing than to be deceived by an artful tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he was unwilling to communicate and this unwillingness had been repeatedly manifested could never be extorted from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> importunity might be appeased or imposture effected by fallacious representations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the rest of the world he was unknown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had often made him the subject of discourse but a glimpse of his figure in the street was the sum of their knowledge who knew most <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none had ever seen him before and received as new the information which my intercourse with him in valencia and my present intercourse enabled me to give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood up also and the two men eyed each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but havent i filled it full of them now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might think so if i hadnt happened to know that you wanted to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean my wanting to be found guilty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if somebody else had accused you the story might have been worth looking into <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it is a child could have invented it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doesnt do much credit to your ingenuity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on the threshold a sudden impulse drew him back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but will you do just one thing to prove it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put my statement in the investigator just as ive made it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only give the other fellows a chance at itmen who dont know anything about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care a damn whether you believe mewhat i want is to convince the grand jury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i oughtnt to have come to a man who knows me your cursed incredulity is infectious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont put my case well because i know in advance its discredited and i almost end by not believing it myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> send a stenographer and put my statement in the paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but denver did not warm to the idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear fellow you seem to forget that all the evidence was pretty thoroughly sifted at the time every possible clue followed up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the public would have been ready enough then to believe that you murdered old lenman you or anybody else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all they wanted was a murdererthe most improbable would have served <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and nothing youve told me has shaken it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> denver laid his cool hand over the others burning fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here old fellow go home and work up a better casethen come in and submit it to the investigator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every few minutes he had to draw out his handkerchief and wipe the moisture from his haggard face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an hour and a half he had been talking steadily putting his case to the district attorney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> luckily he had a speaking acquaintance with allonby and had obtained without much difficulty a private audience on the very day after his talk with robert denver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the interval between he had hurried home got out of his evening clothes and gone forth again at once into the dreary dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his fear of ascham and the alienist made it impossible for him to remain in his rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it seemed to him that the only way of averting that hideous peril was by establishing in some sane impartial mind the proof of his guilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if he had not been so incurably sick of life the electric chair seemed now the only alternative to the strait jacket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he paused to wipe his forehead he saw the district attorney glance at his watch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gesture was significant and granice lifted an appealing hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont expect you to believe me now but cant you put me under arrest and have the thing looked into <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allonby smiled faintly under his heavy grayish moustache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a ruddy face full and jovial in which his keen professional eyes seemed to keep watch over impulses not strictly professional <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont know that we need lock you up just yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of course im bound to look into your statement granice rose with an exquisite sense of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely allonby wouldnt have said that if he hadnt believed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can be found at any time at my apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you say to leaving it for an hour or two this evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im giving a little supper at rectorsquiet little affair you understand just miss melrosei think you know herand a friend or two and if youll join us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> granice stumbled out of the office without knowing what reply he had made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waited for four daysfour days of concentrated horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well well he continued his indignation subsiding alls fair in carnival i suppose but this gentleman here is under sailing orders and i fear we must break up your little party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this tony saw count rialto step forward looking very small and explanatory and uncovering obsequiously to the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can assure you sir said the count in his best english that this incident is the result of an unfortunate misunderstanding and if you will oblige us by dismissing these myrmidons any of my friends here will be happy to offer satisfaction to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mounce shrank visibly at this and the captain burst into a loud guffaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why my cock thats very handsome of you considering the ropes at your throats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but well not take advantage of your generosity for i fear mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bracknell has already trespassed on it too long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spluttered suddenly decoying young innocents with that devils bait of yours his eye fell on polixena and his voice softened unaccountably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah well we must all see the carnival once i suppose he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alls well that ends well as the fellow says in the play and now if you please mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bracknell if youll take the reverend gentlemans arm there well bid adieu to our hospitable entertainers and right about face for the hepzibah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ballinger is one of the ladies who pursue culture in bands as though it were dangerous to meet alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this end she had founded the lunch club an association composed of herself and several other indomitable huntresses of erudition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lunch club after three or four winters of lunching and debate had acquired such local distinction that the entertainment of distinguished strangers became one of its accepted functions in recognition of which it duly extended to the celebrated osric dane on the day of her arrival in hillbridge an invitation to be present at the next meeting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other members behind her back were of one voice in deploring her unwillingness to cede her rights in favor of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plinth whose house made a more impressive setting for the entertainment of celebrities while as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leveret observed there was always the picture gallery to fall back on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plinth made no secret of sharing this view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had always regarded it as one of her obligations to entertain the lunch clubs distinguished guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plinth was almost as proud of her obligations as she was of her picturegallery she was in fact fond of implying that the one possession implied the other and that only a woman of her wealth could afford to live up to a standard as high as that which she had set herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an allround sense of duty roughly adaptable to various ends was in her opinion all that providence exacted of the more humbly stationed but the power which had predestined mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plinth to keep footmen clearly intended her to maintain an equally specialized staff of responsibilities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the more to be regretted that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ballinger whose obligations to society were bounded by the narrow scope of two parlourmaids should have been so tenacious of the right to entertain osric dane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the question of that ladys reception had for a month past profoundly moved the members of the lunch club <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not that they felt themselves unequal to the task but that their sense of the opportunity plunged them into the agreeable uncertainty of the lady who weighs the alternatives of a wellstocked wardrobe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leveret were fluttered by the thought of exchanging ideas with the author of the wings of death no forebodings of the kind disturbed the conscious adequacy of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wings of death had in fact at miss van vluycks suggestion been chosen as the subject of discussion at the last club meeting and each member had thus been enabled to express her own opinion or to appropriate whatever seemed most likely to be of use in the comments of the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roby alone had abstained from profiting by the opportunity thus offered but it was now openly recognised that as a member of the lunch club mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it all comes as miss van vluyck put it of accepting a woman on a mans estimation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roby returning to hillbridge from a prolonged sojourn in exotic regionsthe other ladies no longer took the trouble to remember wherehad been emphatically commended by the distinguished biologist professor foreland as the most agreeable woman he had ever met and the members of the lunch club awed by an encomium that carried the weight of a diploma and rashly assuming that the professors social sympathies would follow the line of his scientific bent had seized the chance of annexing a biological member <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at miss van vluycks first offhand mention of the pterodactyl mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the princes receptionroom although of no great size was fitted up with all the state and luxury which the fame and power of its owner demanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a high dais at the further end was roofed in by a broad canopy of scarlet velvet spangled with silver fleursdelis and supported at either corner by silver rods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was approached by four steps carpeted with the same material while all round were scattered rich cushions oriental mats and costly rugs of fur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the choicest tapestries which the looms of arras could furnish draped the walls whereon the battles of judas maccabaeus were set forth with the jewish warriors in plate of proof with crest and lance and banderole as the naive artists of the day were wont to depict them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few rich settles and bancals choicely carved and decorated with glazed leather hangings of the sort termed or basane completed the furniture of the apartment save that at one side of the dais there stood a lofty perch upon which a cast of three solemn prussian gerfalcons sat hooded and jesseled as silent and motionless as the royal fowler who stood beside them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the centre of the dais were two very high chairs with dorserets which arched forwards over the heads of the occupants the whole covered with lightblue silk thickly powdered with golden stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on that to the right sat a very tall and well formed man with red hair a livid face and a cold blue eye which had in it something peculiarly sinister and menacing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lounged back in a careless position and yawned repeatedly as though heartily weary of the proceedings stooping from time to time to fondle a shaggy spanish greyhound which lay stretched at his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the other throne there was perched bolt upright with prim demeanor as though he felt himself to be upon his good behavior a little round pippin faced person who smiled and bobbed to every one whose eye he chanced to meet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between and a little in front of them on a humble charette or stool sat a slim dark young man whose quiet attire and modest manner would scarce proclaim him to be the most noted prince in europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a jupon of dark blue cloth tagged with buckles and pendants of gold seemed but a sombre and plain attire amidst the wealth of silk and ermine and gilt tissue of fustian with which he was surrounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat with his two hands clasped round his knee his head slightly bent and an expression of impatience and of trouble upon his clear wellchiselled features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind the thrones there stood two men in purple gowns with ascetic clean shaven faces and half a dozen other high dignitaries and office holders of aquitaine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> below on either side of the steps were forty or fifty barons knights and courtiers ranged in a triple row to the right and the left with a clear passage in the centre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there sits the prince whispered sir john chandos as they entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he on the right is pedro whom we are about to put upon the spanish throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other is don james whom we purpose with the aid of god to help to his throne in majorca <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now follow me and take it not to heart if he be a little short in his speech for indeed his mind is full of many very weighty concerns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prince however had already observed their entrance and springing to his feet he had advanced with a winning smile and the light of welcome in his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we do not need your good offices as herald here sir john said he in a low but clear voice these valiant knights are very well known to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> welcome to aquitaine sir nigel loring and sir oliver buttesthorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay keep your knee for my sweet father at windsor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are like to give you some work to do ere you see the downs of hampshire once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nought my sire save that i have heard men say that there is a dish named an olla which is prepared there though i have never been clear in my mind as to whether it was but a ragout such as is to be found in the south or whether there is some seasoning such as fennel or garlic which is peculiar to spain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your doubts sir oliver shall soon be resolved answered the prince laughing heartily as did many of the barons who surrounded them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his majesty here will doubtless order that you have this dish hotly seasoned when we are all safely in castile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will have a hotly seasoned dish for some folk i know of answered don pedro with a cold smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my friend sir oliver can fight right hardily without either bite or sup remarked the prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did i not see him at poictiers when for two days we had not more than a crust of bread and a cup of foul water yet carrying himself most valiantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with my own eyes i saw him in the rout sweep the head from a knight of picardy with one blow of his sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rogue got between me and the nearest french victual wain muttered sir oliver amid a fresh titter from those who were near enough to catch his words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have forty menatarms sire said sir oliver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i have one hundred archers and a score of lancers but there are two hundred men who wait for me on this side of the water upon the borders of navarre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are a free company sire and they are called the white company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the astonishment of the knight his words provoked a burst of merriment from the barons round in which the two kings and the prince were fain to join <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir nigel blinked mildly from one to the other until at last perceiving a stout blackbearded knight at his elbow whose laugh rang somewhat louder than the others he touched him lightly upon the sleeve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perchance my fair sir he whispered there is some small vow of which i may relieve you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> might we not have some honorable debate upon the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your gentle courtesy may perhaps grant me an exchange of thrusts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay nay sir nigel cried the prince fasten not the offence upon sir robert briquet for we are one and all bogged in the same mire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> truth to say our ears have just been vexed by the doings of the same company and i have even now made vow to hang the man who held the rank of captain over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i little thought to find him among the bravest of my own chosen chieftains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the vow is now nought for as you have never seen your company it would be a fools act to blame you for their doings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my liege said sir nigel it is a very small matter that i should be hanged albeit the manner of death is somewhat more ignoble than i had hoped for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the other hand it would be a very grievous thing that you the prince of england and the flower of knighthood should make a vow whether in ignorance or no and fail to bring it to fulfilment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vex not your mind on that the prince answered smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have had a citizen from montauban here this very day who told us such a tale of sack and murder and pillage that it moved our blood but our wrath was turned upon the man who was in authority over them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear and honored master cried nigel in great anxiety i fear me much that in your gentleness of heart you are straining this vow which you have taken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there be so much as a shadow of a doubt as to the form of it it were a thousand times best peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very well able to look to my own vows and their performance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hope to see you both in the banquethall anon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile you will attend upon us with our train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he bowed and chandos plucking sir oliver by the sleeve led them both away to the back of the press of courtiers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why little coz he whispered you are very eager to have your neck in a noose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had you asked as much from our new ally don pedro he had not baulked you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between friends there is overmuch of the hangman in him and too little of the prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but indeed this white company is a rough band and may take some handling ere you find yourself safe in your captaincy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i doubt not with the help of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul that i shall bring them to some order sir nigel answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there are many faces here which are new to me though others have been before me since first i waited upon my dear master sir walter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pray you to tell me sir john who are these priests upon the dais <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the one is the archbishop of bordeaux nigel and the other the bishop of agen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by my troth he seems to be a man of much wisdom and valor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is sir william fenton who with my unworthy self is the chief counsellor of the prince he being high steward and i the seneschal of aquitaine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the knights upon the right beside von pedro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are cavaliers of spain who have followed him in his exile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the one at his elbow is fernando de castro who is as brave and true a man as heart could wish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in front to the right are the gascon lords <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may well tell them by their clouded brows for there hath been some illwill of late betwixt the prince and them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tall and burly man is the captal de buch whom i doubt not that you know for a braver knight never laid lance in rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that heavyfaced cavalier who plucks his skirts and whispers in his ear is lord oliver de clisson known also as the butcher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he it is who stirs up strife and forever blows the dying embers into flame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man with the mole upon his cheek is the lord pommers and his two brothers stand behind him with the lord lesparre lord de rosem lord de mucident sir perducas dalbret the souldich de la trane and others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> further back are knights from quercy limousin saintonge poitou and aquitaine with the valiant sir guiscard dangle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is he in the rosecolored doublet with the ermine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are all englishmen some of the household and others who like yourself are captains of companies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is lord neville sir stephen cossington and sir matthew gourney with sir walter huet sir thomas banaster and sir thomas felton who is the brother of the high steward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mark well the man with the high nose and flaxen beard who hath placed his hand upon the shoulder of the dark hardfaced cavalier in the ruststained jupon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observed sir nigel they both bear the print of their armor upon their coteshardies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> methinks they are men who breathe freer in a camp than a court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are many of us who do that nigel said chandos and the head of the court is i dare warrant among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of these two men the one is sir hugh calverley and the other is sir robert knolles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir nigel and sir oliver craned their necks to have the clearer view of these famous warriors the one a chosen leader of free companies the other a man who by his fierce valor and energy had raised himself from the lowest ranks until he was second only to chandos himself in the esteem of the army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hath no light hand in war hath sir robert said chandos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he passes through a country you may tell it for some years to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard that in the north it is still the use to call a house which hath but the two gable ends left without walls or roof a knolles mitre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have often heard of him said nigel and i have hoped to be so far honored as to run a course with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but hark sir john what is amiss with the prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whilst chandos had been conversing with the two knights a continuous stream of suitors had been ushered in adventurers seeking to sell their swords and merchants clamoring over some grievance a ship detained for the carriage of troops or a tun of sweet wine which had the bottom knocked out by a troop of thirsty archers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few words from the prince disposed of each case and if the applicant liked not the judgment a quick glance from the princes dark eyes sent him to the door with the grievance all gone out of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the younger ruler had sat listlessly upon his stool with the two puppet monarchs enthroned behind him but of a sudden a dark shadow passed over his face and he sprang to his feet in one of those gusts of passion which were the single blot upon his noble and generous character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what message do you bring to us from our brother of navarre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the newcomer to whom this abrupt query had been addressed was a tall and exceedingly handsome cavalier who had just been ushered into the apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his swarthy cheek and raven black hair spoke of the fiery south and he wore his long black cloak swathed across his chest and over his shoulders in a graceful sweeping fashion which was neither english nor french <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with stately steps and many profound bows he advanced to the foot of the dais before replying to the princes question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my powerful and illustrious master he began charles king of navarre earl of evreux count of champagne who also writeth himself overlord of bearn hereby sends his love and greetings to his dear cousin edward the prince of wales governor of aquitaine grand commander of tush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interrupted the prince who had been beating the ground with his foot impatiently during this stately preamble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we already know our cousins titles and style and certes we know our own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the point man and at once are the passes open to us or does your master go back from his word pledged to me at libourne no later than last michaelmas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would ill become my gracious master sire to go back from promise given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he does but ask some delay and certain conditions and hostages conditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is he speaking to the prince of england or is it to the bourgeois provost of some halfcaptured town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may find much to mend in his own condition ere long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay sire if you would but enough enough don martin cried the prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a sorry sight to see so true a knight pleading in so false a cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know the doings of our cousin charles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know that while with the right hand he takes our fifty thousand crowns for the holding of the passes open he hath his left outstretched to henry of trastamare or to the king of france all ready to take as many more for the keeping them closed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know our good charles and by my blessed namesaint the confessor he shall learn that i know him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sets his kingdom up to the best bidder like some scullion farrier selling a glandered horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is my lord cried don martin i cannot stand there to hear such words of my master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am only a scarecrow stuffed with straw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore i have no brains and i come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw so that i may become as much a man as any other in your dominions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because you are wise and powerful and no one else can help me answered the scarecrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never grant favors without some return said oz but this much i will promise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will kill for me the wicked witch of the west i will bestow upon you a great many brains and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the land of oz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you asked dorothy to kill the witch said the scarecrow in surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but until she is dead i will not grant your wish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now go and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what oz had said and dorothy was surprised to find that the great wizard was not a head as she had seen him but a lovely lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the same said the scarecrow she needs a heart as much as the tin woodman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came oz has sent for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the tin woodman followed him and came to the great throne room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not know whether he would find oz a lovely lady or a head but he hoped it would be the lovely lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he said to himself if it is the head i am sure i shall not be given a heart since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if it is the lovely lady i shall beg hard for a heart for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when the woodman entered the great throne room he saw neither the head nor the lady for oz had taken the shape of a most terrible beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros only there were five eyes in its face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long slim legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thick woolly hair covered every part of it and a more dreadfullooking monster could not be imagined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was fortunate the tin woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but being only tin the woodman was not at all afraid although he was much disappointed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am oz the great and terrible spoke the beast in a voice that was one great roar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who are you and why do you seek me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a woodman and made of tin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore i have no heart and cannot love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pray you to give me a heart that i may be as other men are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i ask it and you alone can grant my request answered the woodman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oz gave a low growl at this but said gruffly if you indeed desire a heart you must earn it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> help dorothy to kill the wicked witch of the west replied the beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the witch is dead come to me and i will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the land of oz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the tin woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible beast he had seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all wondered greatly at the many forms the great wizard if he is a beast when i go to see him i shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all i ask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if he is the lovely lady i shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bidding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might as well he denied it but i immediately left the room and flew to the nursery to hide my feelings if i could not soothe them there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was too much hurt to express any further dissatisfaction with his plans or at all to refer to the subject again except for the necessary arrangements concerning his departure and the conduct of affairs during his absence till the day before he went when i earnestly exhorted him to take care of himself and keep out of the way of temptation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laughed at my anxiety but assured me there was no cause for it and promised to attend to my advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose it is no use asking you to fix a day for your return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why no i hardly can under the circumstances but be assured i dont wish to keep you a prisoner at home i replied i should not grumble at your staying whole months away if you can be happy so long without me provided i knew you were safe but i dont like the idea of your being there among your friends as you call pooh pooh you silly girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think i cant take care of you didnt last time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this time arthur i added earnestly show me that you can and teach me that i need not fear to trust he promised fair but in such a manner as we seek to soothe a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no and henceforth i can never trust his word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was early in march that he went and he did not return till july <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time he did not trouble himself to make excuses as before and his letters were less frequent and shorter and less affectionate especially after the first few weeks they came slower and slower and more terse and careless every time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still when i omitted writing he complained of my neglect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i wrote sternly and coldly as i confess i frequently did at the last he blamed my harshness and said it was enough to scare him from his home when i tried mild persuasion he was a little more gentle in his replies and promised to return but i had learnt at last to disregard his promises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those were four miserable months alternating between intense anxiety despair and indignation pity for him and pity for myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet through all i was not wholly comfortless i had my darling sinless inoffensive little one to console me but even this consolation was embittered by the constantlyrecurring thought how shall i teach him hereafter to respect his father but i remembered that i had brought all these afflictions in a manner wilfully upon myself and i determined to bear them without a murmur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time i resolved not to give myself up to misery for the transgressions of another and endeavoured to divert myself as much as i could and besides the companionship of my child and my dear faithful rachel who evidently guessed my sorrows and felt for them though she was too discreet to allude to them i had my books and pencil my domestic affairs and the welfare and comfort of arthurs poor tenants and labourers to attend to and i sometimes sought and obtained amusement in the company of my young friend esther hargrave occasionally i rode over to see her and once or twice i had her to spend the day with me at the manor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hargrave did not visit london that season having no daughter to marry she thought it as well to stay at home and economise and for a wonder walter came down to join her in the beginning of june and stayed till near the close of august <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first time i saw him was on a sweet warm evening when i was sauntering in the park with little arthur and rachel who is head nurse and ladysmaid in one for with my secluded life and tolerably active habits i require but little attendance and as she had nursed me and coveted to nurse my child and was moreover so very trustworthy i preferred committing the important charge to her with a young nurserymaid under her directions to engaging any one else besides it saves money and since i have made acquaintance with arthurs affairs i have learnt to regard that as no trifling recommendation for by my own desire nearly the whole of the income of my fortune is devoted for years to come to the paying off of his debts and the money he contrives to squander away in london is incomprehensible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was standing with rachel beside the water amusing the laughing baby in her arms with a twig of willow laden with golden catkins when greatly to my surprise he entered the park mounted on his costly black hunter and crossed over the grass to meet me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saluted me with a very fine compliment delicately worded and modestly delivered withal which he had doubtless concocted as he rode along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told me he had brought a message from his mother who as he was riding that way had desired him to call at the manor and beg the pleasure of my company to a friendly family dinner tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no one to meet but ourselves said he but esther is very anxious to see you and my mother fears you will feel solitary in this great house so much alone and wishes she could persuade you to give her the pleasure of your company more frequently and make yourself at home in our more humble dwelling till mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huntingdons return shall render this a little more conducive to she is very kind i answered but i am not alone you see and will you not come tomorrow then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she will be sadly disappointed i did not relish being thus compassionated for my loneliness but however i promised to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observed he looking round upon the sunny park with its imposing swell and slope its placid water it is a lovely evening answered i and i sighed to think how little i had felt its loveliness and how little of a paradise sweet grassdale was to me how still less to the voluntary exile from its scenes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hargrave divined my thoughts i cannot tell but with a halfhesitating sympathising seriousness of tone and manner he asked if i had lately heard from mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought not he muttered as if to himself looking thoughtfully on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes that is said he with increasing hesitation and an appearance of suppressed indignation he was as well as as he deserved to be but under circumstances i should have deemed incredible for a man so favoured as he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he here looked up and pointed the sentence with a serious bow to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huntingdon he continued but i cannot suppress my indignation when i behold such infatuated blindness and perversion of taste but perhaps you are not aware he paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am aware of nothing sir except that he delays his coming longer than i expected and if at present he prefers the society of his friends to that of his wife and the dissipations of the town to the quiet of country life i suppose i have those friends to thank for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their tastes and occupations are similar to his and i dont see why his conduct should awaken either their you wrong me cruelly answered he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huntingdons society for the last few weeks and as for his tastes and occupations they are quite beyond me lonely wanderer as i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where i have but sipped and tasted he drains the cup to the dregs and if ever for a moment i have sought to drown the voice of reflection in madness and folly or if i have wasted too much of my time and talents among reckless and dissipated companions god knows i would gladly renounce them entirely and for ever if i had but half the blessings that man so thanklessly casts behind his back but half the inducements to virtue and domestic orderly habits that he despises but such a home and such a partner to share it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huntingdon he added aloud that i could be guilty of inciting him to persevere in his present pursuits on the contrary i have remonstrated with him again and again i have frequently expressed my surprise at his conduct and reminded him of his duties and his privileges but to no purpose enough mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hargrave you ought to be aware that whatever my husbands faults may be it can only aggravate the evil for me to am i then a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am your nearest neighbour your sons godfather and your husbands friend intimate acquaintance must precede real friendship i know but have you then forgotten the six or seven weeks i spent under your roof last autumn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huntingdon to think that your husband is the most enviable man in the world and i should be the next if you would if you knew more of me you would not think it or if you did you i stepped backward as i spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw that i wished the conversation to end and immediately taking the hint he gravely bowed wished me goodevening and turned his horse towards the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he appeared grieved and hurt at my unkind reception of his sympathising overtures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not sure that i had done right in speaking so harshly to him but at the time i had felt irritated almost insulted by his conduct it seemed as if he was presuming upon the absence and neglect of my husband and insinuating even more than the truth against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rachel had moved on during our conversation to some yards distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rode up to her and asked to see the child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took it carefully into his arms looked upon it with an almost paternal he then tenderly kissed it and restored it to the gratified nurse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not in general he replied but that is such a sweet child and so like its mother he added in a lower tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think sir theres a bit of both she replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he departed and rachel pronounced him a very nice gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had still my doubts on the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the course of the following six weeks i met him several times but always save once in company with his mother or his sister or both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i called on them he always happened to be at home and when they called on me it was always he that drove them over in the phaeton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother evidently was quite delighted with his dutiful attentions and newlyacquired domestic habits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time that i met him alone was on a bright but not oppressively hot day in the beginning of july i had taken little arthur into the wood that skirts the park and there seated him on the moss cushioned roots of an old oak and having gathered a handful of bluebells and wildroses i was kneeling before him and presenting them one by one to the grasp of his tiny fingers enjoying the heavenly beauty of the flowers through the medium of his smiling eyes forgetting for the moment all my cares laughing at his gleeful laughter and delighting myself with his delight when a shadow suddenly eclipsed the little space of sunshine on the grass before us and looking up i beheld walter hargrave standing and gazing upon us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huntingdon said he but i was spellbound i had neither the power to come forward and interrupt you nor to withdraw from the contemplation of such a scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he approached the child and stooped to take his hand but on seeing that his caresses were likely to produce tears and lamentations instead of a reciprocation of friendly demonstrations he prudently drew back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a pleasure and comfort that little creature must be to you mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he observed with a touch of sadness in his intonation as he admiringly contemplated the infant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is replied i and then i asked after his mother and sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he politely answered my inquiries and then returned again to the subject i wished to avoid though with a degree of timidity that witnessed his fear to offend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not these three weeks i might have said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a letter from him this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish it were such a one as i could show to his lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he half drew from his waistcoat pocket a letter with arthurs still beloved hand on the address scowled at it and put it back again adding but he tells me he indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to me he always avowed it his it struck me like a blow this proof of premeditated transgression and systematic disregard of truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is only of a piece with the rest of his conduct observed mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hargrave thoughtfully regarding me and reading i suppose my feelings in my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may rely upon it if the assurance can give you any pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huntingdon that you can rejoice at his return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh huntingdon you know not what you slight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took up my baby and wishing him goodmorning departed to indulge my thoughts unscrutinized within the sanctum of my home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes delighted though i was angered by arthurs conduct and though i felt that he had wronged me and was determined he should feel it too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the following morning i received a few lines from him myself confirming hargraves intimations respecting his approaching return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he did come next week but in a condition of body and mind even worse than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not however intend to pass over his derelictions this time without a remark i found it would not do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the first day he was weary with his journey and i was glad to get him back i would not upbraid him then i would wait till tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next morning he was weary still i would wait a little longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at dinner when after breakfasting at twelve oclock on a bottle of sodawater and a cup of strong coffee and lunching at two on another bottle of sodawater mingled with brandy he was finding fault with everything on the table and declaring we must change our cook i thought the time was come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the same cook as we had before you went arthur said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have been letting her get into slovenly habits then while i was away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is enough to poison one eating such a disgusting mess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for another two hours we were occupied in traversing a few hundred yards to the foot of the barrier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then turning about the corner of a walllike outcropping of granite we came upon a smooth area of two or three acres before the base of the towering pile of ice and rock that had baffled us for days and before us beheld the dark and cavernous mouth of a cave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from this repelling portal the horrid stench was emanating and as thuvan dihn espied the place he halted with an exclamation of profound astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i should have lived to witness the reality of the fabled carrion caves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if these indeed be they we have found a way beyond the icebarrier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ancient chronicles of the first historians of barsoomso ancient that we have for ages considered them mythologyrecord the passing of the yellow men from the ravages of the green hordes that overran barsoom as the drying up of the great oceans drove the dominant races from their strongholds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they tell of the wanderings of the remnants of this once powerful race harassed at every step until at last they found a way through the icebarrier of the north to a fertile valley at the pole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the opening to the subterranean passage that led to their haven of refuge a mighty battle was fought in which the yellow men were victorious and within the caves that gave ingress to their new home they piled the bodies of the dead both yellow and green that the stench might warn away their enemies from further pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ever since that longgone day have the dead of this fabled land been carried to the carrion caves that in death and decay they might serve their country and warn away invading enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here too is brought so the fable runs all the waste stuff of the nationeverything that is subject to rot and that can add to the foul stench that assails our nostrils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and death lurks at every step among rotting dead for here the fierce apts lair adding to the putrid accumulation with the fragments of their own prey which they cannot devour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a horrid avenue to our goal but it is the only one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are sure then that we have found the way to the land of the yellow men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as sure as may be he replied having only ancient legend to support my belief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but see how closely so far each detail tallies with the worldold story of the hegira of the yellow race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i am sure that we have discovered the way to their ancient hiding place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it be true and let us pray that such may be the case i said then here may we solve the mystery of the disappearance of tardos mors jeddak of helium and mors kajak his son for no other spot upon barsoom has remained unexplored by the many expeditions and the countless spies that have been searching for them for nearly two years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last word that came from them was that they sought carthoris my own brave son beyond the icebarrier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we talked we had been approaching the entrance to the cave and as we crossed the threshold i ceased to wonder that the ancient green enemies of the yellow men had been halted by the horrors of that awful way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bones of dead men lay man high upon the broad floor of the first cave and over all was a putrid mush of decaying flesh through which the apts had beaten a hideous trail toward the entrance to the second cave beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the roof of this first apartment was low like all that we traversed subsequently so that the foul odors were confined and condensed to such an extent that they seemed to possess tangible substance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one was almost tempted to draw his shortsword and hew his way through in search of pure air beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can man breathe this polluted air and live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not for long i imagine i replied so let us make haste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will go first and you bring up the rear with woola between <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come and with the words i dashed forward across the fetid mass of putrefaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not until we had passed through seven caves of different sizes and varying but little in the power and quality of their stenches that we met with any physical opposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then within the eighth cave we came upon a lair of apts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a full score of the mighty beasts were disposed about the chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some were sleeping while others tore at the freshkilled carcasses of newbrought prey or fought among themselves in their lovemaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here in the dim light of their subterranean home the value of their great eyes was apparent for these inner caves are shrouded in perpetual gloom that is but little less than utter darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to attempt to pass through the midst of that fierce herd seemed even to me the height of folly and so i proposed to thuvan dihn that he return to the outer world with woola that the two might find their way to civilization and come again with a sufficient force to overcome not only the apts but any further obstacles that might lie between us and our goal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime i continued i may discover some means of winning my way alone to the land of the yellow men but if i am unsuccessful one life only will have been sacrificed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should we all go on and perish there will be none to guide a succoring party to dejah thoris and your daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall not return and leave you here alone john carter replied thuvan dihn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether you go on to victory or death the jeddak of ptarth remains at your side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew from his tone that it were useless to attempt to argue the question and so i compromised by sending woola back with a hastily penned note enclosed in a small metal case and fastened about his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had four hundred dol lars in the bank and i gave her that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had gone i cried like a silly boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pretty soon i had a chance to sell the house and i sent that money to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wash williams and george willard arose from the pile of railroad ties and walked along the tracks toward town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wrote me a letter and asked me to come to their house at dayton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i got there it was evening about this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wash williams voice rose to a half scream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat in the parlor of that house two hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her mother took me in there and left me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were plush chairs and a couch in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hated the men i thought had wronged her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sick of living alone and wanted her back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the longer i waited the more raw and tender i became <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought that if she came in and just touched me with her hand i would perhaps faint away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wash williams stopped and stood staring at george willard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys body shook as from a chill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again the mans voice became soft and low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she came into the room naked he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while i sat there she was taking the girls clothes off perhaps coaxing her to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first i heard voices at the door that led into a little hallway and then it opened softly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl was ashamed and stood perfectly still staring at the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had pushed the girl in through the door she stood in the hallway waiting hoping we wouldwell you see waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george willard and the telegraph operator came into the main street of winesburg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lights from the store windows lay bright and shining on the sidewalks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in imagi nation he also became old and shapeless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt get the mother killed said wash williams staring up and down the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i struck her once with a chair and then the neighbors came in and took it away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont ever have a chance to kill her now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she died of a fever a month after that happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house in which seth richmond of winesburg lived with his mother had been at one time the show place of the town but when young seth lived there its glory had become somewhat dimmed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the huge brick house which banker white had built on buck eye street had overshadowed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the richmond place was in a little valley far out at the end of main street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farmers coming into town by a dusty road from the south passed by a grove of walnut trees skirted the fair ground with its high board fence covered with advertisements and trotted their horses down through the valley past the richmond place into town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as much of the country north and south of winesburg was devoted to fruit and berry raising seth saw wagonloads of berry pickersboys girls and womengoing to the fields in the morning and returning covered with dust in the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chattering crowd with their rude jokes cried out from wagon to wagon sometimes irritated him sharply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he regretted that he also could not laugh boisterously shout meaningless jokes and make of himself a figure in the endless stream of moving giggling activity that went up and down the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the richmond house was built of limestone and although it was said in the village to have become run down had in reality grown more beautiful with every passing year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already time had begun a little to color the stone lending a golden richness to its surface and in the evening or on dark days touching the shaded places beneath the eaves with wavering patches of browns and blacks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house had been built by seths grandfather a stone quarryman and it together with the stone quarries on lake erie eighteen miles to the north had been left to his son clarence richmond seths father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clarence richmond a quiet passionate man extraordinarily admired by his neighbors had been killed in a street fight with the editor of a newspaper in toledo ohio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fight concerned the publication of clarence richmonds name coupled with that of a woman school teacher and as the dead man had begun the row by firing upon the editor the effort to punish the slayer was unsuccessful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the quarrymans death it was found that much of the money left to him had been squandered in specula tion and in insecure investments made through the influence of friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> left with but a small income virginia richmond had settled down to a retired life in the village and to the raising of her son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although she had been deeply moved by the death of the husband and fa ther she did not at all believe the stories concerning him that ran about after his death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to her mind the sensitive boyish man whom all had instinctively loved was but an unfortunate a being too fine for everyday life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll be hearing all sorts of stories but you are not to believe what you hear she said to her son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a good man full of tenderness for everyone and should not have tried to be a man of affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no matter how much i were to plan and dream of your future i could not imagine anything better for you than that you turn out as good a man as your father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several years after the death of her husband vir ginia richmond had become alarmed at the growing demands upon her income and had set herself to the task of increasing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had learned stenogra phy and through the influence of her husbands friends got the position of court stenographer at the county seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there she went by train each morning during the sessions of the court and when no court sat spent her days working among the rosebushes in her garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a tall straight figure of a woman with a plain face and a great mass of brown hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the relationship between seth richmond and his mother there was a quality that even at eighteen had begun to color all of his traffic with men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an almost unhealthy respect for the youth kept the mother for the most part silent in his presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she did speak sharply to him he had only to look steadily into her eyes to see dawning there the puzzled look he had already noticed in the eyes of others when he looked at them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth was that the son thought with remark able clearness and the mother did not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she expected from all people certain conventional reactions to life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a boy was your son you scolded him and he trem bled and looked at the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you had scolded enough he wept and all was forgiven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the weeping and when he had gone to bed you crept into his room and kissed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> virginia richmond could not understand why her son did not do these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the severest repri mand he did not tremble and look at the floor but instead looked steadily at her causing uneasy doubts to invade her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was very rough and weighted with authority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young woman burke said peremptorily the twentieth century limited leaves grand central station at four oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it arrives in chicago at eightfiftyfive tomorrow morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pulled a massive gold watch from his waistcoat pocket glanced at it thrust it back and concluded ponderously you will just about have time to catch that train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary regarded the stockily built officer with a halfamused contempt which she was at no pains to conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im working for the good of new york city he answered venomously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary let a ripple of cadenced laughter escape her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little smile twisted the lips of the district attorney but he caught himself quickly and spoke with stern gravity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss turner i think you will find that a different tone will serve you better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well then she said genially let us be comfortable during that little period <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made a gesture of invitation toward chairs which burke disdained to accept but demarest seated himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd better be packing your trunk the inspector rumbled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary inquired with a tantalizing assumption of innocence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the twentieth century limited this afternoon the inspector declared in a voice of growing wrath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marys assertion was made very quietly but with an underlying firmness that irritated the official beyond endurance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her words were an ironic protest against the mans obstreperous noisiness no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you wanted quiet words with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the instant mary was on her feet facing him and there was a gleam in her eyes as they met his that bade him pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burke was checked but he retained his severity of bearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will either go to chicago or youll go up the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary answered in a voice charged with cynicism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you cant do it again mary declared with an assurance that excited the astonishment of the police official <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary laughed in a cadence of genial merriment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because she replied gaily if he could he would have had me in prison some time ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burke winced but he made shift to conceal his realization of the truth she had stated to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary met the assertion with a serenity that was baffling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor ones she vouchsafed not those that have money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary cried with a fine show of virtuous indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what about the thirty thousand dollars you got on that partnership swindle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spose you certainly not was the ready reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man advertised for a partner in a business sure to bring big and safe returns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the business proposed was to buy a tract of land and subdivide it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deeds to the land were all forged and the supposed seller was his confederate with whom he was to divide the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we formed a partnership with a capital of sixty thousand dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we paid the money into the bank and then at once i drew it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see he wanted to get my money illegally but instead i managed to get his legally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it was the district attorney by an effort retained his severe expression of righteous disapprobation but he admitted the truth of her contention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a partner has the right to draw out any or all of the partnership funds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i was a partner mary said contentedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see inspector you wrong meyou do really <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he roared youll never pull another one on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can mary permitted herself to laugh mockingly in the face of the badgered official <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you for telling me she said graciously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and let me say incidentally that miss lynch at the present moment is painlessly extracting ten thousand dollars from general hastings in a perfectly legal manner inspector burke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well anyhow burke shouted you may stay inside the law but youve got to get outside the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to employ an elephantine bantering tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the level now do you think you could get away with that young gilder scheme youve been mary appeared puzzled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answer is once for all leave town this afternoon or youll be in the tombs in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hitherto she had been cynical sarcastic laughing careless impudent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now of a sudden she was all seriousness and she spoke with a gravity that despite their volition impressed both the men before her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it cant be done inspector she said sedately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the declaration simple as it was aroused the official to new indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he vociferated overflowing with anger at this flouting of the authority he represented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary opened a drawer of the desk and took out the document obtained that morning from harris and held it forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> demarest looked over the inspectors shoulder and his eyes grew larger as he read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he was at an end of the reading he regarded the passive woman at the desk with a new respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not easy for him to interpret the legal phraseology <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary was kind enough to make the document clear to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a temporary restraining order from the supreme court instructing you to let me alone until you have legal proof that i the plethoric official stared hard at the injunction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a considerable number were made with the view of organising a system of aerial navigation analogous to that of the seasteerage in a certain direction by means of oars or sailsin a word to investigate the possibility of sailing through the air to any point fixed upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with this object that the experiments at dijon took place and these were the most serious attempts down to our times that have been made to steer balloons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the middle of the globe of the balloon were placed four oars two sails and a helm and these were under the management of the voyagers who sat in the car and worked them by means of ropes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the report of guyton de morveau to the academy at dijon informs us that these different paraphernalia were not altogether useless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following the very strong wind which arose immediately before our departure had driven us down to tee ground many times making us fear for the safety of our oars c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we resolved to throw over as much ballast as would enable us to rise against the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of provisions was thrown over and then we rose so rapidly that all the objects around were instantly passed and were very soon lost to view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the swelling form of our balloon told us that the gas inside had expanded under the heat of the sun and the lessening density of the surrounding air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we opened the two valves but even this outlet was insufficient and we had to cut a hole about seven or eight inches long in the lower part of the balloon through which the gas might escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at five minutes past five we passed above a village which we did not know and here we let fall a bag filled with bran and carrying with it a flag and a written message to the effect that we were all well and that the barometer was recording inches lines and the thermometer one degree and a half below zero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very keen cold attacked the ears but this was the only inconvenience experienced until the voyagers were lost in a sea of clouds that shut them out from the view of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun at length began to descend and they then perceived by a slackening in the lower part of the balloon that it was time for them to think of returning to the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judging from the compass that they were not far from the town of auxonne they resolved to use all their endeavours to reach that place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sailing appliances had been considerably damaged by the rough weather at starting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rigging being disarranged one of the oars had got broken another had become entangled in the rigging so that there remained only two of the four oars and these being on the same side were absolutely useless during the greatest part of the voyage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the adventurers however assert that they made them work from eight to nine minutes with the greatest ease making use of them to tack to the southeast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hoped then to be able to descend near where we judged auxonne to be the writer continues but we lost much gas by the opening in the balloon and descended more rapidly than we expected or wished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we looked to our small stock of ballast with anxiety but there was no need of it and we came very softly down upon a slope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the aeronauts arrived at magnylesauxonne the inhabitants gazed upon them in terror and two men and three women fell down on their knees before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is an extract from the report of the experiment of the th of june the principal object of which was the attempt to m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de verley and myself mounted in the balloon says guyton de morveau at seven oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we rose rapidly and in an almost perpendicular direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fall of the mercury in the barometer was scarcely perceptible when the dilation of the hydrogen gas in the balloon had become considerable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the globe swelled out and a light vapour around the mouth announced to us that the gas was commencing to escape by the safetyvalve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we assisted its escape by pulling the valvestring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having reduced the dilation sufficiently for our purposes we resolved to attempt the working of the balloon before the whole town and to turn it from the east to the north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we saw with pleasure that our machinery answered by the working of the helm the prow of our airboat was turned in the direction we desired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the oars working only on one side supported the helm and altogether we got on as we wished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we described a curve crossing the road from dijon to langres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mercury had descended to inches lines which announced that we were gradually rising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we attempted for some time to follow the route to i langres but the wind drove us off our course in spite of all our efforts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at nine oclock our barometer informed us that we had ascended to the height of feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de verley took advantage of this elevation to put some touch wood to a burningglass lines in diameter and the touch wood lighted immediately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the aeronauts decided to direct their course for dijon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after resetting the helm with this intention they worked their oars and proceeded in that direction more than feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but heat and fatigue obliged them to suspend their endeavours and the current drove them upon mirebeau where throwing out the last of their ballast and regulating their descent they came softly down upon a cornfield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was economy in living under that roof and economy was desirable but in some way he was dissatisfied with the arrangement it immersed him so deeply in soninlawship to melbury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his deputy was out and fitzpiers fell into conversation with his former landlady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a little soured at losing by his marriage so profitable a tenant as the surgeon had proved to be duling his residence under her roof and the more so in there being hardly the remotest chance of her getting such another settler in the hintock solitudes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis what i dont wish to repeat sir least of all to you she mumbled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is what people say about your hasty marrying dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereas they wont believe you know such clever doctrines in physic as they once supposed of ye seeing as you could marry into mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> melburys family which is only hintockborn such as me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are kindly welcome to their opinion said fitzpiers not allowing himself to recognize that he winced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has seen you sir whether or no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she saw you in some hotel or street for a minute or two while you were away travelling and accidentally heard your name and when she made some remark about you miss ellisthats her maidtold her you was on your weddingtower with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> melburys daughter and she said he ought to have done better than that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fear he has spoiled his chances she says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fitzpiers did not talk much longer to this cheering housewife and walked home with no very brisk step <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he entered the door quietly and went straight upstairs to the drawingroom extemporized for their use by melbury in his and his brides absence expecting to find her there as he had left her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fire was burning still but there were no lights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked into the next apartment fitted up as a little diningroom but no supper was laid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went to the top of the stairs and heard a chorus of voices in the timbermerchants parlor below graces being occasionally intermingled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> descending and looking into the room from the doorway he found quite a large gathering of neighbors and other acquaintances praising and congratulating mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fitzpiers on her return among them being the dairyman farmer bawtree and the masterblacksmith from great hintock also the cooper the hollowturner the exciseman and some others with their wives who lived hard by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grace girl that she was had quite forgotten her new dignity and her husbands she was in the midst of them blushing and receiving their compliments with all the pleasure of old comradeship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fitzpiers experienced a profound distaste for the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> melbury was nowhere in the room but melburys wife perceiving the doctor came to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we thought grace and i she said that as they have called hearing you were come we could do no less than ask them to supper and then grace proposed that we should all sup together as it is the first night of your return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time grace had come round to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it not good of them to welcome me so warmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she exclaimed with tears of friendship in her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after so much good feeling i could not think of our shutting ourselves up away from them in our own diningroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly notcertainly not said fitzpiers and he entered the room with the heroic smile of a martyr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as they sat down to table melbury came in and seemed to see at once that fitzpiers would much rather have received no such demonstrative reception <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thereupon privately chid his wife for her forwardness in the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> melbury declared that it was as much graces doing as hers after which there was no more to be said by that young womans tender father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time fitzpiers was making the best of his position among the wideelbowed and genial company who sat eating and drinking and laughing and joking around him and getting warmed himself by the good cheer was obliged to admit that after all the supper was not the least enjoyable he had ever known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times however the words about his having spoiled his opportunities repeated to him as those of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charmond haunted him like a handwriting on the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at one moment he would mentally put an indignant query why mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charmond or any other woman should make it her business to have opinions about his opportunities at another he thought that he could hardly be angry with her for taking an interest in the doctor of her own parish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he would drink a glass of grog and so get rid of the misgiving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these hitches and quaffings were soon perceived by grace as well as by her father and hence both of them were much relieved when the first of the guests to discover that the hour was growing late rose and declared that he must think of moving homeward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the words melbury rose as alertly as if lifted by a spring and in ten minutes they were gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now grace said her husband as soon as he found himself alone with her in their private apartments weve had a very pleasant evening and everybody has been very kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we must come to an understanding about our way of living here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we continue in these rooms there must be no mixing in with your people below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant stand it and thats the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been sadly surprised at the suddenness of his distaste for those oldfashioned woodland forms of life which in his courtship he had professed to regard with so much interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must be simply your fathers tenants he continued and our goings and comings must be as independent as if we lived elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly edgari quite see that it must be so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you joined in with all those people in my absence without knowing whether i should approve or disapprove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i came i couldnt help myself at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sighing yesi see i ought to have waited though they came unexpectedly and i thought i had acted for the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus the discussion ended and the next day fitzpiers went on his old rounds as usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was easy for so supersubtle an eye as his to discern or to think he discerned that he was no longer regarded as an extrinsic unfathomed gentleman of limitless potentiality scientific and social but as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> melburys compeer and therefore in a degree only one of themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hintock woodlandlers held with all the strength of inherited conviction to the aristocratic principle and as soon as they had discovered that fitzpiers was one of the old buckbury fitzpierses they had accorded to him for nothing a touching of hatbrims promptness of service and deference of approach which melbury had to do without though he paid for it over and over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now having proved a traitor to his own cause by this marriage fitzpiers was believed in no more as a superior hedged by his own divinity while as doctor he began to be rated no higher than old jones whom they had so long despised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his few patients seemed in his two months absence to have dwindled considerably in number and no sooner had he returned than there came to him from the board of guardians a complaint that a pauper had been neglected by his substitute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a fit of pride fitzpiers resigned his appointment as one of the surgeons to the union which had been the nucleus of his practice here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of a fortnight he came indoors one evening to grace more briskly than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have written to me again about that practice in budmouth that i once negotiated for he said to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the premium asked is eight hundred pounds and i think that between your father and myself it ought to be raised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we can get away from this place forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the question had been mooted between them before and she was not unprepared to consider it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had not proceeded far with the discussion when a knock came to the door and in a minute grammer ran up to say that a message had arrived from hintock house requesting dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charmond had met with a slight accident through the overturning of her carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is something anyhow said fitzpiers rising with an interest which he could not have defined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have had a presentiment that this mysterious woman and i were to be better acquainted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter words were murmured to himself alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodnight said grace as soon as he was ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall be asleep probably when you return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time since their marriage that he had left her without a kiss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this account his face had been seen but fitfully in hintock and he would probably have disappeared from the place altogether but for his slight business connection with melbury on whose premises giles kept his cidermaking apparatus now that he had no place of his own to stow it in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> coming here one evening on his way to a hut beyond the wood where he now slept he noticed that the familiar brown thatched pinion of his paternal roof had vanished from its site and that the walls were levelled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in present circumstances he had a feeling for the spot that might have been called morbid and when he had supped in the hut aforesaid he made use of the spare hour before bedtime to return to little hintock in the twilight and ramble over the patch of ground on which he had first seen the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he repeated this evening visit on several like occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even in the gloom he could trace where the different rooms had stood could mark the shape of the kitchen chimneycorner in which he had roasted apples and potatoes in his boyhood cast his bullets and burned his initials on articles that did and did not belong to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the appletrees still remained to show where the garden had been the oldest of them even now retaining the crippled slant to northeast given them by the great november gale of which carried a brig bodily over the chesil bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were at present bent to still greater obliquity by the heaviness of their produce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apples bobbed against his head and in the grass beneath he crunched scores of them as he walked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on the evening under notice that half sitting half leaning against one of these inclined trunks winterborne had become lost in his thoughts as usual till one little star after another had taken up a position in the piece of sky which now confronted him where his walls and chimneys had formerly raised their outlines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house had jutted awkwardly into the road and the opening caused by its absence was very distinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the silence the trot of horses and the spin of carriagewheels became audible and the vehicle soon shaped itself against the blank sky bearing down upon him with the bend in the lane which here occurred and of which the house had been the cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could discern the figure of a woman high up on the drivingseat of a phaeton a groom being just visible behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently there was a slight scrape then a scream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> winterborne went across to the spot and found the phaeton half overturned its driver sitting on the heap of rubbish which had once been his dwelling and the man seizing the horses heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charmonds and the unseated charioteer that lady herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his inquiry if she were hurt she made some incoherent reply to the effect that she did not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the damage in other respects was little or none the phaeton was righted mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charmond placed in it and the reins given to the servant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeared that she had been deceived by the removal of the house imagining the gap caused by the demolition to be the opening of the road so that she turned in upon the ruins instead of at the bend a few yards farther on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the lady impatiently and they started on their way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had not however gone many paces when the air being still winterborne heard her say stop tell that man to call the doctormr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i find i am hurt more seriously than i thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> winterborne took the message from the groom and proceeded to the doctors at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having delivered it he stepped back into the darkness and waited till he had seen fitzpiers leave the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood for a few minutes looking at the window which by its light revealed the room where grace was sitting and went away under the gloomy trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fitzpiers duly arrived at hintock house whose doors he now saw open for the first time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> contrary to his expectation there was visible no sign of that confusion or alarm which a serious accident to the mistress of the abode would have occasioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was shown into a room at the top of the staircase cosily and femininely draped where by the light of the shaded lamp he saw a woman of full round figure reclining upon a couch in such a position as not to disturb a pile of magnificent hair on the crown of her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a deep purple dressinggown formed an admirable foil to the peculiarly rich brown of her hairplaits her left arm which was naked nearly up to the shoulder was thrown upward and between the fingers of her right hand she held a cigarette while she idly breathed from her plump lips a thin stream of smoke towards the ceiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctors first feeling was a sense of his exaggerated prevision in having brought appliances for a serious case the next something more curious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the scene and the moment were new to him and unanticipated the sentiment and essence of the moment were indescribably familiar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then quietly the electric lights came on again and an uproar of nocturnal newsvendors began in the streets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the units of that vast and varied population bought and learnt what had happened there had been a fight and new york had hoisted the white flag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lamentable incidents that followed the surrender of new york seem now in the retrospect to be but the necessary and inevitable consequence of the clash of modern appliances and social conditions produced by the scientific century on the one hand and the tradition of a crude romantic patriotism on the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first people received the fact with an irresponsible detachment much as they would have received the slowing down of the train in which they were travelling or the erection of a public monument by the city to which they belonged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was rather the manner in which the first news was met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they took it in the same spectacular spirit they had displayed at the first apparition of the airfleet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only slowly was this realisation of a capitulation suffused with the flush of passion only with reflection did they make any personal application <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the newspapers which were issued about one in the morning contained no particulars of the terms upon which new york had yieldednor did they give any intimation of the quality of the brief conflict that had preceded the capitulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came the explicit statement of the agreement to victual the german airships to supply the complement of explosives to replace those employed in the fight and in the destruction of the north atlantic fleet to pay the enormous ransom of forty million dollars and to surrender the in the east river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came too longer and longer descriptions of the smashing up of the city hall and the navy yard and people began to realise faintly what those brief minutes of uproar had meant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they read the tale of men blown to bits of futile soldiers in that localised battle fightingagainst hope amidst an indescribable wreckage of flags hauled down by weeping men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and these strange nocturnal editions contained also the first brief cables from europe of the fleet disaster the north atlantic fleet for which new york had always felt an especial pride and solicitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly hour by hour the collective consciousness woke up the tide of patriotic astonishment and humiliation came floating in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> america had come upon disaster suddenly new york discovered herself with amazement giving place to wrath unspeakable a conquered city under the hand of her conqueror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as that fact shaped itself in the public mind there sprang up as flames spring up an angry repudiation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before day broke the swift american anger was running through all the city through every soul in those contagious millions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before it took action before it took shape the men in the airships could feel the gigantic insurgence of emotion as cattle and natural creatures feel it is said the coming of an earthquake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the newspapers of the knype group first gave the thing words and a formula <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men took that up everywhere it passed from mouth to mouth at every street corner under the paling lights of dawn orators stood unchecked calling upon the spirit of america to arise making the shame a personal reality to every one who heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to bert listening five hundred feet above it seemed that the city which had at first produced only confused noises was now humming like a hive of beesof very angry bees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the smashing of the city hall and postoffice the white flag had been hoisted from a tower of the old park row building and thither had gone mayor ohagen urged thither indeed by the terrorstricken property owners of lower new york to negotiate the capitulation with von winterfeld <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vaterland having dropped the secretary by a rope ladder remained hovering circling very slowly above the great buildings old and new that clustered round city hall park while the helmholz which had done the fighting there rose overhead to a height of perhaps two thousand feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so bert had a near view of all that occurred in that central place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the city hall and court house the postoffice and a mass of buildings on the west side of broadway had been badly damaged and the three former were a heap of blackened ruins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the case of the first two the loss of life had not been considerable but a great multitude of workers including many girls and women had been caught in the destruction of the postoffice and a little army of volunteers with white badges entered behind the firemen bringing out the often still living bodies for the most part frightfully charred and carrying them into the big monson building close at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everywhere the busy firemen were directing their bright streams of water upon the smouldering masses their hose lay about the square and long cordons of police held back the gathering lack masses of people chiefly from the east side from these central activities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in violent and extraordinary contrast with this scene of destruction close at hand were the huge newspaper establishments of park row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were all alight and working they had not been abandoned even while the actual bomb throwing was going on and now staff and presses were vehemently active getting out the story the immense and dreadful story of the night developing comment and in most cases spreading the idea of resistance under the very noses of the airships <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a long time bert could not imagine what these callously active offices could be then he detected the noise of the presses and emitted his gaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond these newspaper buildings again and partially hidden by the arches of the old elevated railway of new york long since converted into a monorail there was another cordon of police and a sort of encampment of ambulances and doctors busy with the dead and wounded who had been killed early in the night by the panic upon brooklyn bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this he saw in the perspectives of a birdseye view as things happening in a big irregularshaped pit below him between cliffs of high building <end> <end> 
<start> <start> northward he looked along the steep canon of broadway down whose length at intervals crowds were assembling about excited speakers and when he lifted his eyes he saw the chimneys and cablestacks and roof spaces of new york and everywhere now over these the watching debating people clustered except where the fires raged and the jets of water flew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everywhere too were flagstaffs devoid of flags one white sheet drooped and flapped and drooped again over the park row buildings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and upon the lurid lights the festering movement and intense shadows of this strange scene there was breaking now the cold impartial dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for bert smallways all this was framed in the frame of the open porthole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a pale dim world outside that dark and tangible rim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all night he had clutched at that rim jumped and quivered at explosions and watched phantom events <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he had been high and now low now almost beyond hearing now flying close to crashings and shouts and outcries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seen airships flying low and swift over darkened and groaning streets watched great buildings suddenly redlit amidst the shadows crumple at the smashing impact of bombs witnessed for the first time in his life the grotesque swift onset of insatiable conflagrations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vaterland did not even fling a bomb she watched and ruled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then down they had come at last to hover over city hall park and it had crept in upon his mind chillingly terrifyingly that these illuminated black masses were great offices afire and that the going to and fro of minute dim spectres of lanternlit grey and white was a harvesting of the wounded and the dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the light grew clearer he began to understand more and more what these crumpled black things signified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had watched hour after hour since first new york had risen out of the blue indistinctness of the landfall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the daylight he experienced an intolerable fatigue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lifted weary eyes to the pink flush in the sky yawned immensely and crawled back whispering to himself across the cabin to the locker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not so.much lie down upon that as fall upon it and instantly become asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there hours after sprawling undignified and sleeping profoundly kurt found him a very image of the democratic mind confronted with the problems of a time too complex for its apprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was pale and indifferent his mouth wide open and he snored <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kurt regarded him for a moment with a mild distaste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wake up he said to smallways stare and lie down decent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said kurt and sat down a tired man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried presently rubbing his hands over his face but id like a cold bath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been looking for stray bullet holes in the airchambers all night until now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well go in and get em and dont come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so bert slightly refreshed by coffee and sleep resumed his helpless cooperation in the war in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went down into the little gallery as the lieutenant had directed and clung to the rail at the extreme end beyond the lookout man trying to seem as inconspicuous and harmless a fragment of life as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wind was rising rather strongly from the southeast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it obliged the vaterland to come about in that direction and made her roll a great deal as she went to and fro over manhattan island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the throbthrob of her slow screw working against the breeze was much more perceptible than when she was going full speed ahead and the friction of the wind against the underside of the gaschamber drove a series of shallow ripples along it and made a faint flapping sound like but fainter than the beating of ripples under the stem of a boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was stationed over the temporary city hall in the park row building and every now and then she would descend to resume communication with the mayor and with washington <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the restlessness of the prince would not suffer him to remain for long in any one place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as rigid as the sleddiscipline of the gods was the discipline maintained by white fang amongst his fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he compelled them to an unremitting respect for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they might do as they pleased amongst themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was his concern that they leave him alone in his isolation get out of his way when he elected to walk among them and at all times acknowledge his mastery over them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hint of stiffleggedness on their part a lifted lip or a bristle of hair and he would be upon them merciless and cruel swiftly convincing them of the error of their way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not for nothing had he been exposed to the pitiless struggles for life in the day of his cubhood when his mother and he alone and unaided held their own and survived in the ferocious environment of the wild <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and not for nothing had he learned to walk softly when superior strength went by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he oppressed the weak but he respected the strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the course of the long journey with grey beaver he walked softly indeed amongst the fullgrown dogs in the camps of the strange man animals they encountered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white fangs strength was developed by the long hours on trail and the steady toil at the sled and it would have seemed that his mental development was wellnigh complete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had come to know quite thoroughly the world in which he lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the world as he saw it was a fierce and brutal world a world without warmth a world in which caresses and affection and the bright sweetnesses of the spirit did not exist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> true he was a god but a most savage god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white fang was glad to acknowledge his lordship but it was a lordship based upon superior intelligence and brute strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something in the fibre of white fangs being that made his lordship a thing to be desired else he would not have come back from the wild when he did to tender his allegiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were deeps in his nature which had never been sounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a kind word a caressing touch of the hand on the part of grey beaver might have sounded these deeps but grey beaver did not caress nor speak kind words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his primacy was savage and savagely he ruled administering justice with a club punishing transgression with the pain of a blow and rewarding merit not by kindness but by withholding a blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so white fang knew nothing of the heaven a mans hand might contain for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides he did not like the hands of the mananimals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was true that they sometimes gave meat but more often they gave hurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hurled stones wielded sticks and clubs and whips administered slaps and clouts and when they touched him were cunning to hurt with pinch and twist and wrench <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in strange villages he had encountered the hands of the children and learned that they were cruel to hurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he had once nearly had an eye poked out by a toddling papoose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from these experiences he became suspicious of all children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they came near with their ominous hands he got up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in a village at the great slave lake that in the course of resenting the evil of the hands of the mananimals he came to modify the law that he had learned from grey beaver namely that the unpardonable crime was to bite one of the gods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this village after the custom of all dogs in all villages white fang went foraging for food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a boy was chopping frozen moosemeat with an axe and the chips were flying in the snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white fang sliding by in quest of meat stopped and began to eat the chips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he observed the boy lay down the axe and take up a stout club <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white fang sprang clear just in time to escape the descending blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy pursued him and he a stranger in the village fled between two tepees to find himself cornered against a high earth bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only way out was between the two tepees and this the boy guarded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holding his club prepared to strike he drew in on his cornered quarry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he faced the boy bristling and snarling his sense of justice outraged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the wastage of meat such as the frozen chips belonged to the dog that found it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had done no wrong broken no law yet here was this boy preparing to give him a beating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did it in a surge of rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he did it so quickly that the boy did not know either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the boy knew was that he had in some unaccountable way been overturned into the snow and that his clubhand had been ripped wide open by white fangs teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but white fang knew that he had broken the law of the gods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had driven his teeth into the sacred flesh of one of them and could expect nothing but a most terrible punishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fled away to grey beaver behind whose protecting legs he crouched when the bitten boy and the boys family came demanding vengeance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white fang listening to the wordy war and watching the angry gestures knew that his act was justified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it came that he learned there were gods and gods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were his gods and there were other gods and between them there was a difference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> justice or injustice it was all the same he must take all things from the hands of his own gods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was not compelled to take injustice from the other gods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was his privilege to resent it with his teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this also was a law of the gods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the day was out white fang was to learn more about this law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mitsah alone gathering firewood in the forest encountered the boy that had been bitten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blows were raining upon him from all sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was an affair of the gods and no concern of his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he realised that this was mitsah one of his own particular gods who was being maltreated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was no reasoned impulse that made white fang do what he then did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mad rush of anger sent him leaping in amongst the combatants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five minutes later the landscape was covered with fleeing boys many of whom dripped blood upon the snow in token that white fangs teeth had not been idle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when mitsah told the story in camp grey beaver ordered meat to be given to white fang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ordered much meat to be given and white fang gorged and sleepy by the fire knew that the law had received its verification <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in line with these experiences that white fang came to learn the law of property and the duty of the defence of property <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the protection of his gods body to the protection of his gods possessions was a step and this step he made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was his gods was to be defended against all the world even to the extent of biting other gods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only was such an act sacrilegious in its nature but it was fraught with peril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gods were allpowerful and a dog was no match against them yet white fang learned to face them fiercely belligerent and unafraid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> duty rose above fear and thieving gods learned to leave grey beavers property alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing in this connection white fang quickly learnt and that was that a thieving god was usually a cowardly god and prone to run away at the sounding of the alarm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he learned that but brief time elapsed between his sounding of the alarm and grey beaver coming to his aid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came to know that it was not fear of him that drove the thief away but fear of grey beaver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white fang did not give the alarm by barking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his method was to drive straight at the intruder and to sink his teeth in if he could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because he was morose and solitary having nothing to do with the other dogs he was unusually fitted to guard his masters property and in this he was encouraged and trained by grey beaver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one result of this was to make white fang more ferocious and indomitable and more solitary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and underneath these wandered the countless flocks and herds of the british food trust with their lonely guards and keepers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a familiar outline anywhere broke the cluster of gigantic shapes below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauls he knew survived and many of the old buildings in westminster embedded out of sight arched over and covered in among the giant growths of this great age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the themes too made no fall and gleam of silver to break the wilderness of the city the thirsty water mains drank up every drop of its waters before they reached the walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its bed and estuary scoured and sunken was now a canal of sea water and a race of grimy bargemen brought the heavy materials of trade from the pool thereby beneath the very feet of the workers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faint and dim in the eastward between earth and sky hung the clustering masts of the colossal shipping in the pool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all the heavy traffic for which there was no need of haste came in gigantic sailing ships from the ends of the earth and the heavy goods for which there was urgency in mechanical ships of a smaller swifter sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to the south over the hills came vast aqueducts with sea water for the sewers and in three separate directions ran pallid linesthe roads stippled with moving grey specks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the first occasion that offered he was determined to go out and see these roads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would come after the flying ship he was presently to try <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his attendant officer described them as a pair of gently curving surfaces a hundred yards wide each one for the traffic going in one direction and made of a substance called eadhamitean artificial substance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far as he could gather resembling toughened glass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along this shot a strange traffic of narrow rubbershod vehicles great single wheels two and four wheeled vehicles sweeping along at velocities of from one to six miles a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> railroads had vanished a few embankments remained as rustcrowned trenches here and there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some few formed the cores of eadhamite ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the first things to strike his attention had been the great fleets of advertisement balloons and kites that receded in irregular vistas northward and southward along the lines of the aeroplane journeys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their passages had ceased and only one littleseeming aeropile circled high in the blue distance above the surrey hills an unimpressive soaring speck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a thing graham had already learnt and which he found very hard to imagine was that nearly all the towns in the country and almost all the villages had disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there only he understood some gigantic hotellike edifice stood amid square miles of some single cultivation and preserved the name of a townas bournemouth wareham or swanage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet the officer had speedily convinced him how inevitable such a change had been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old order had dotted the country with farmhouses and every two or three miles was the ruling landlords estate and the place of the inn and cobbler the grocers shop and churchthe village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every eight miles or so was the country town where lawyer corn merchant woolstapler saddler veterinary surgeon doctor draper milliner and so forth lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every eight milessimply because that eight mile marketing journey four there and back was as much as was comfortable for the farmer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but directly the railways came into play and after them the light railways and all the swift new motor cars that had replaced waggons and horses and so soon as the high roads began to be made of wood and rubber and eadhamite and all sorts of elastic durable substancesthe necessity of having such frequent market towns disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they drew the worker with the gravitational force of seemingly endless work the employer with their suggestions of an infinite ocean of labour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as the standard of comfort rose as the complexity of the mechanism of living increased life in the country had become more and more costly or narrow and impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the disappearance of vicar and squire the extinction of the general practitioner by the city specialist had robbed the village of its last touch of culture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after telephone kinematograph and phonograph had replaced newspaper book schoolmaster and letter to live outside the range of the electric cables was to live an isolated savage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the country were neither means of being clothed nor fed according to the refined conceptions of the time no efficient doctors for an emergency no company and no pursuits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover mechanical appliances in agriculture made one engineer the equivalent of thirty labourers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so inverting the condition of the city clerk in the days when london was scarce inhabitable because of the coaly foulness of its air the labourers now came hurrying by road or air to the city and its life and delights at night to leave it again in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the city had swallowed up humanity man had entered upon a new stage in his development <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first had come the nomad the hunter then had followed the agriculturist of the agricultural state whose towns and cities and ports were but the headquarters and markets of the countryside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now logical consequence of an epoch of invention was this huge new aggregation of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> save london there were only four other cities in britain edinburgh portsmouth manchester and shrewsbury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such things as these simple statements of fact though they were to contemporary men strained grahams imagination to picture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he glanced over beyond there at the strange things that existed on the continent it failed him altogether <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a vision of city beyond city cities on great plains cities beside great rivers vast cities along the sea margin cities girdled by snowy mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over a great part of the earth the english tongue was spoken taken together with its spanish american and hindoo and negro and pidgin dialects it was the everyday language of twothirds of the people of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the continent save as remote and curious survivals three other languages alone held sway german which reached to antioch and genoa and jostled spanishenglish at gdiz a gallicised russian which met the indian english in persia and kurdistan and the pidgin english in pekin and french still clear and brilliant the language of lucidity which shared the mediterranean with the indian english and german and reached through a negro dialect to the congo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and everywhere now through the cityset earth save in the administered black belt territories of the tropics the same cosmopolitan social organisatior prevailed and everywhere from pole to equator his property and his responsibilities extended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole world was civilised the whole world dwelt in cities the whole world was property <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the british empire and throughout america his ownership was scarcely disguised congress and parliament were usually regarded as antique curious gatherings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and even in the two empires of russia and germany the influence of his wealth was conceivably of enormous weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there of course came problemspossibilities but uplifted as he was even russia and germany seemed sufficiently remote <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of the quality of the black belt administration and of what that might mean for him he thought after the fashion of his former days not at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it should hang like a threat over the spacious vision before him could not enter his nineteenth century mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his mind turned at once from the scenery to the thought of a vanished dread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the twentieth century had discovered with reluctant certainty that the average chinaman was as civilised more moral and far more intelligent than the average european serf and had repeated on a gigantic scale the fraternisation of scot and englishman that happened in the seventeenth century <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as asano put it they thought it over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they found we were white men after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> graham turned again to the view and his thoughts took a new direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of the dim southwest glittering and strange voluptuous and in some way terrible shone those pleasure cities of which the kinematographphonograph and the old man in the street had spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strange places reminiscent of the legendary sybaris cities of art and beauty mercenary art and mercenary beauty sterile wonderful cities of motion and music whither repaired all who profited by the fierce inglorious economic struggle that went on in the glaring labyrinth below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how fierce he could judge from the fact that these latterday people referred back to the england of the nineteenth century as the figure of an idyllic easygoing life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned his eyes to the scene immediately before him again trying to conceive the big factories of that intricate maze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> northward he knew were the potters makers not only of earthenware and china but of the kindred pastes and compounds a subtler mineralogical chemistry had devised there were the makers of statuettes and wall ornaments and much intricate furniture there too were the factories where feverishly competitive authors devised their phonograph discourses and advertisements and arranged the groupings and developments for their perpetually startling and novel kinematographic dramatic works <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thence too flashed the worldwide messages the worldwide falsehoods of the newstellers the chargers of the telephonic machines that had replaced the newspapers of the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should you be anxious to conceal them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you tempt him to wring them till he quietly as a lamb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she drew a sigh and stretched herself like a child reviving and sinking again to sleep and five minutes after i felt one little pulse at her heart and did she ever mention me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked hesitating as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her senses never returned she recognised nobody from the time you left her i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lies with a sweet smile on her face and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her life closed in a gentle dream may she wake as kindly in the other may she wake in torment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried with frightful vehemence stamping his foot and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not there not in heaven not perished where <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said you cared nothing for my sufferings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i pray one prayer i repeat it till my tongue stiffens catherine earnshaw may you not rest as long as i am living you said i killed you haunt me then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the murdered do haunt their murderers i believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know that ghosts have wandered on earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be with me always take any form drive me mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot live he dashed his head against the knotted trunk and lifting up his eyes howled not like a man but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree and his hand and forehead were both stained probably the scene i witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it hardly moved my compassion it appalled me still i felt reluctant to quit him so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching he thundered a command for me to go and i obeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was beyond my skill to quiet or console <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lintons funeral was appointed to take place on the friday following her decease and till then her coffin remained uncovered and strewn with flowers and scented leaves in the great drawing room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> linton spent his days and nights there a sleepless guardian and a circumstance concealed from all but me heathcliff spent his nights at least outside equally a stranger to repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i held no communication with him still i was conscious of his design to enter if he could and on the tuesday a little after dark when my master from sheer fatigue had been compelled to retire a couple of hours i went and opened one of the windows moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity cautiously and briefly too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed i shouldnt have discovered that he had been there except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpses face and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair fastened with a silver thread which on examination i ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round catherines neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents replacing them by a black lock of his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i twisted the two and enclosed them together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> earnshaw was of course invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave he sent no excuse but he never came so that besides her husband the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place of catherines interment to the surprise of the villagers was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the lintons nor yet by the tombs of her own relations outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirkyard where the wall is so low that heath and bilberryplants have climbed over it from the moor and peatmould almost buries it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her husband lies in the same spot now and they have each a simple headstone above and a plain grey block at their feet to mark the graves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that friday made the last of our fine days for a month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the evening the weather broke the wind shifted from south to north east and brought rain first and then sleet and snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts the larks were silent the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dreary and chill and dismal that morrow did creep over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my master kept his room i took possession of the lonely parlour converting it into a nursery and there i was sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee rocking it to and fro and watching meanwhile the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window when the door opened and some person entered out of breath and laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i supposed it one of the maids and i cried have done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answered a familiar voice but i know edgar is in with that the speaker came forward to the fire panting and holding her hand to her side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have run the whole way from wuthering heights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued after a pause except where ive flown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt count the number of falls ive had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there shall be an explanation as soon as i can give it only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to gimmerton and tell a servant to seek up a few the intruder was mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she certainly seemed in no laughing predicament her hair streamed on her shoulders dripping with snow and water she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore befitting her age more than her position a low frock with short sleeves and nothing on either head or neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the frock was of light silk and clung to her with wet and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers add to this a deep cut under one ear which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely a white face scratched and bruised and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when i had had leisure to examine her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear young lady i exclaimed ill stir nowhere and hear nothing till you have removed every article of your clothes and put on dry things and certainly you shall not go to gimmerton to certainly i shall she said walking or riding yet ive no objection to dress myself decently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ah see how it flows she insisted on my fulfilling her directions before she would let me touch her and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire did i obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ellen she said when my task was finished and she was seated in an easychair on the hearth with a cup of tea before her you sit down opposite me and put poor catherines baby away i dont like to see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mustnt think i care little for catherine because i behaved so foolishly on entering ive cried too bitterly yes more than any one else has reason to cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we parted unreconciled you remember and i shant forgive myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for all that i was not going to sympathise with him the brute beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the last thing of his i have about me she slipped the gold ring from her third finger and threw it on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued striking it with childish spite and then ill burn it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shall buy another if he gets me back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hed be capable of coming to seek me to tease edgar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dare not stay lest that notion should possess his wicked head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besides edgar has not been kind has he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i wont come suing for his assistance nor will i bring him into more trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> necessity compelled me to seek shelter here though if i had not learned he was out of the way id have halted at the kitchen washed my face warmed myself got you to bring what i wanted and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed of that incarnate goblin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a pity earnshaw is not his match in strength i wouldnt have run till id seen him all but well dont talk so fast miss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i interrupted youll disorder the handkerchief i have tied round your face and make the cut bleed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drink your tea and take breath and give over laughing laughter is sadly out of place under this roof and in an undeniable truth she replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it maintains a constant wail send it out of my hearing for an hour i rang the bell and committed it to a servants care and then i inquired what had urged her to escape from wuthering heights in such an unlikely plight and where she meant to go as she refused remaining with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought and i wished to remain answered she to cheer edgar and take care of the baby for two things and because the grange is my right home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i tell you he wouldnt let me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry could bear to think that we were tranquil and not resolve on poisoning our comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within earshot or eyesight i notice when i enter his presence the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes i have to feel that sentiment for him and partly from original aversion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over england supposing i contrived a clear escape and therefore i must get quite away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive recovered from my first desire to be killed by him id rather hed kill himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has extinguished my love effectually and so im at my ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can recollect yet how i loved him and can dimly imagine that i could still be loving him if no no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if he had doted on me the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly knowing him so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would that he could be blotted out hush hush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be more charitable hes not a human being she retorted and he has no claim on my charity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave him my heart and he took and pinched it to death and flung it back to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people feel with their hearts ellen and since he has destroyed mine i have not power to feel for him and i would not though he groaned from this to his dying day and wept tears of blood for catherine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here isabella began to cry but immediately dashing the water from her lashes she recommenced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you asked what has driven me to flight at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was compelled to attempt it because i had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of and proceeded to murderous violence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of self preservation so i fairly broke free and if ever i come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kept himself sober for the purpose tolerably sober not going to bed mad at six oclock and getting up drunk at twelve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> consequently he rose in suicidal low spirits as fit for the church as for a dance and instead he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pool of lingo was strangely altered it was no longer the quiet pool which it was in summer verifying the words of the old welsh poet that the deepest pool of the river is always the stillest in the summer and of the softest sound but a howling turbid gulf in which branches of trees dead animals and rubbish were whirling about in the wildest confusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nights were generally less rainy than the days and sometimes by the pallid glimmer of the moon i would take a stroll along some favourite path or road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night as i was wandering slowly along the path leading through the groves of pen y coed i was startled by an unearthly cry it was the shout of the dylluan or owl as it flitted over the tops of the trees on its nocturnal oh that cry of the dylluan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a strange wild cry it is how unlike any other sound in nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cry which no combination of letters can give the slightest idea of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what resemblance does shakespears towhittowhoo bear to the cry of the owl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none whatever those who hear it for the first time never know what it is however accustomed to talk of the cry of the owl and towhit towhoo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man might be wandering through a wood with shakespears owlchorus in his mouth but were he then to hear for the first time the real shout of the owl he would assuredly stop short and yet no doubt that strange cry is a fitting cry for the owl the strangest in its habits and look of all birds the bird of whom by all nations the strangest tales are told <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh what strange tales are told of the owl especially in connection with its long lifedness but of all the strange wild tales connected with the age of the owl strangest of all is the old welsh tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i heard the owls cry in the groves of pen y coed that tale rushed into my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had heard it from the singular groom who had taught me to gabble welsh in my boyhood and had subsequently read it in an old tattered welsh storybook which by chance fell into my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the the eagle of the alder grove after being long married and having had many children by his mate lost her by death and became a widower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after some time he took it into his head to marry the owl of the cowlyd coomb but fearing he should have issue by her and by that means sully his lineage he went first of all to the oldest creatures in the world in order to obtain information about her age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first he went to the stag of fernyside brae whom he found sitting by the old stump of an oak and inquired the age of the owl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stag said i have seen this oak an acorn which is now lying on the ground without either leaves or bark nothing in the world wore it up but my rubbing myself against it once a day when i got up so i have seen a vast number of years but i assure you that i have never seen the owl older or younger than she is today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however there is one older than myself and that is the salmon trout of glyn llifon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to him went the eagle and asked him the age of the owl and got for answer i have a year over my head for every gem on my skin and for every egg in my roe yet have i always seen the owl look the same but there is one older than myself and that is the ousel of cilgwry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> away went the eagle to cilgwry and found the ousel standing upon a little rock and asked him the age of the owl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quoth the ousel you see that the rock below me is not larger than a man can carry in one of his hands i have seen it so large that it would have taken a hundred oxen to drag it and it has never been worn save by my drying my beak upon it once every night and by my striking the tip of my wing against it in rising in the morning yet never have i known the owl older or younger than she is today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however there is one older than i and that is the toad of cors fochnod and unless he knows her age no one knows it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to him went the eagle and asked the age of the owl and the toad replied i have never eaten anything save what i have sucked from the earth and have never eaten half my fill in all the days of my life but do you see those two great hills beside the cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen the place where they stand level ground and nothing produced those heaps save what i discharged from my body who have ever eaten so very little yet never have i known the owl anything else but an old hag who cried toohoohoo and scared children with her voice even as she does at present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the eagle of gwernabwy the stag of fernyside brae the salmon trout of glyn llifon the ousel of cilgwry the toad of cors fochnod and the owl of coomb cowlyd are the oldest creatures in the world the oldest of them all being the owl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chirk the middleton family castell y waen the park the court yard the young housekeeper the portraits melin y castell humble meal fine chests for the dead hales and the weather having become fine myself and family determined to go and see chirk castle a mansion ancient and beautiful and abounding with all kinds of agreeable and romantic associations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was founded about the beginning of the fifteenth century by a st john lord of bletsa from a descendant of whom it was purchased in the year by sir thomas middleton the scion of an ancient welsh family who following commerce acquired a vast fortune and was lord mayor of london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the time of the great civil war it hoisted the banner of the king and under sir thomas the son of the lord mayor made a brave defence against lambert the parliamentary general though eventually compelled to surrender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was held successively by four sir thomas middletons and if it acquired a warlike celebrity under the second it obtained a peculiarly hospitable one under the fourth whose daughter the fruit of a second marriage became countess of warwick and eventually the wife of the poet and moralist addison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his time the hospitality of chirk became the theme of many a bard particularly of huw morris who in one of his songs has gone so far as to say that were the hill cefn uchaf turned into beef and bread and the rill ceiriog into beer or wine they would be consumed in half a year by the hospitality of chirk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though no longer in the hands of one of the name of middleton chirk castle is still possessed by one of the blood the mother of the present proprietor being the eldest of three sisters lineal descendants of the lord mayor between whom in default of an heir male the wide possessions of the middleton family were divided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gentleman who bears the name of biddulph is lord lieutenant of the county of denbigh and notwithstanding his warbreathing name which is gothic and signifies wolf of battle is a person of highly amiable disposition and one who takes great interest in the propagation of to view this place which though in english called chirk castle is styled in welsh castell y waen or the castle of the meadow we started on foot about ten oclock of a fine bright morning attended by john jones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are two roads from llangollen to chirk one the low or post road and the other leading over the berwyn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we passed by the yew cottage which i have described on a former occasion and began to ascend the mountain making towards its northeastern corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the road at first was easy enough but higher up became very steep and somewhat appalling being cut out of the side of the hill which shelves precipitously down towards the valley of the dee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the top of the mountain were three lofty beechtrees growing on the very verge of the precipice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the road for about twenty yards is fenced on its dangerous side by a wall parts of which are built between the stems of the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just beyond the wall a truly noble prospect presented itself to our eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the north were bold hills their sides and skirts adorned with numerous woods and white farmhouses a thousand feet below us was the dee and its wondrous pont y cysultau <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john jones said that if certain mists did not intervene we might descry the sea of liverpool and perhaps the only thing wanting to make the prospect complete was that sea of liverpool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were however quite satisfied with what we saw and turning round the corner of the hill reached its top where for a considerable distance there is level ground and where though at a great altitude we found ourselves in a fair and fertile region and amidst a scene of busy rural life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we saw fields and inclosures and here and there cornstacks some made and others not yet completed about which people were employed and waggons and horses moving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> passing over the top of the hill we began to descend the southern side which was far less steep than the one we had lately surmounted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a little way the road descended through a wood which john jones told us was the beginning of the park of biddulph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is plenty of game in this wood said he pheasant cocks and pheasant hens to say nothing of hares and coneys and in the midst of it there is a space sown with a particular kind of corn for the support of the pheasant hens and pheasant cocks which in the shootingseason afford pleasant sport for biddulph and his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the foot of the descent just where the road made a turn to the east we passed by a building which stood amidst trees with a this said john jones is the house where the bailiff lives who farms and buys and sells for biddulph and fattens the beeves and swine and the geese ducks and other poultry which biddulph consumes at his table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scenery was now very lovely consisting of a mixture of hill and dale open space and forest in fact the best kind of park scenery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we caught a glimpse of a lake in which john jones said there were generally plenty of swans and presently saw the castle which stands on a green grassy slope from which it derives its welsh name of castell y waen gwaen in the cumrian language signifying a meadow or uninclosed place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it fronts the west the direction from which we were coming on each side it shows five towers of which the middlemost which protrudes beyond the rest and at the bottom of which is the grand gate is by far the bulkiest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a noble edifice it looked and to my eye bore no slight seeing a kind of ranger we inquired of him what it was necessary for us to do and by his direction proceeded to the southern side of the castle and rung the bell at a small gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the southern side had a far more antique appearance than the western huge towers with small windows and partly covered with ivy frowned down upon us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a servant making his appearance i inquired whether we could see the house he said we could and that the housekeeper would show it to us in a little time but that at present she was engaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we entered a large quadrangular court on the lefthand side was a door and staircase leading into the interior of the building and farther on was a gateway which was no doubt the principal entrance from the park <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the eastern side of the spacious court was a kennel chained to which was an enormous dog partly of the bloodhound partly of the mastiff species who occasionally uttered a deep magnificent bay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the sun was hot we took refuge from it under the gateway the gate of which at the further end towards the park was closed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here my wife and daughter sat down on a small brass cannon seemingly a sixpounder which stood on a very dilapidated carriage from the appearance of the gun which was of an ancient form and very much battered and that of the carriage i had little doubt that both had been in the castle at the time of the siege <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as my two loved ones sat i walked up and down recalling to my mind all i had heard and read in connection with this castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought of its gallant defence against the men of oliver i thought of its roaring hospitality in the time of the fourth sir thomas and i thought of the many beauties who had been born in its chambers had danced in its halls had tripped across its court and had subsequently given at last we were told that she housekeeper was waiting for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the housekeeper who was a genteel goodlooking young woman welcomed us at the door which led into the interior of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after we had written our names she showed us into a large room or hall on the righthand side on the ground floor where were some helmets and ancient halberts and also some pictures of great personages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the floor was of oak and so polished and slippery that walking upon it was attended with some danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wishing that john jones our faithful attendant who remained timidly at the doorway should participate with us in the wonderful sights we were about to see i inquired of the housekeeper whether he might come with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she replied with a smile that it was not the custom to admit guides into the apartments but that he might come provided he chose to take off his shoes adding that the reason she wished him to take off his shoes was an apprehension that if he kept them on he would injure the floors with their rough nails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then went to john jones and told him in english that he might attend us provided he took off his shoes poor john however only smiled and said dim saesneg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must speak to him in your native language said i provided you wish him to understand you he has no english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am speaking to him in my native language said the young housekeeper with another smile and if he has no english i have no welsh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its no bad thing to be english after all and as for not speaking welsh there are many in wales who would be glad to have much less welsh than they have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then told john jones the condition on which he might attend us whereupon he took off his shoes with great glee and attended us holding them in we presently went upstairs to what the housekeeper told us was the principal drawingroom and a noble room it was hung round with the portraits of kings and queens and the mighty of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here on canvas was noble mary the wife of william of orange and her consort by her side whose part like a true wife she always took <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was wretched mary of scotland the murderess of her own lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here were the two charleses and both the dukes of ormond the great duke who fought stoutly in ireland against papist and roundhead and the pretenders duke who tried to stab his native land and died a foreign colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here amongst other daughters of the house was the very proud daughter of the house the warwick dowager who married the spectator and led him the life of a dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked haughty and cold and not particularly handsome but i could not help gazing with a certain degree of interest and respect on the countenance of the vixen who served out the gentility worshipper in such prime style <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many were the rooms which we entered of which i shall say nothing save that they were noble in size and rich in objects of interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last we came to what was called the picture gallery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a long panelled room extending nearly the whole length of the northern side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing which struck us on entering was the huge skin of a lion stretched out upon the floor the head however which was towards the door was stuffed and with its monstrous teeth looked so formidable and lifelike that we were almost afraid to touch it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> against every panel was a portrait amongst others was that of sir thomas middleton the stout governor of the castle during the time of the siege <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near to it was the portrait of his rib dame middleton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farther down on the same side were two portraits of nell gwynn the one painted when she was a girl the other when she had attained a more mature age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were both by lely the apelles of the court of wanton charles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the other side was one of the duke of gloucester the son of queen anne who had he lived would have kept the georges from the throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this gallery on the southern side was a cabinet of ebony and silver presented by charles the second to the brave warrior sir thomas and which according to tradition cost seven thousand pounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this room which was perhaps the most magnificent in the castle was the last we visited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the candle of god whilst we wandered through these magnificent halls was flaming in the firmament and its rays penetrating through the long narrow windows showed them off and all the gorgeous things which they contained to great advantage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we left the castle we all said not excepting john jones that we had never seen in our lives anything more princely after a little time my wife and daughter complaining of being rather faint i asked john jones whether there was an inn in the neighbourhood where some refreshment could be procured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said there was and that he would conduct us to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we directed our course towards the east rousing successively and setting a scampering three large herds of deer the common ones were yellow and of no particular size but at the head of each herd we observed a big old black fellow with immense antlers one of these was particularly large indeed as huge as a bull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we soon came to the verge of a steep descent down which we went not without some risk of falling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last we came to a gate it was locked however on john jones shouting an elderly man with his right hand bandaged came and opened it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked him what was the matter with his hand and he told me that he had lately lost three fingers whilst working at a sawmill up at the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on my inquiring about the inn he said he was the master of it and led the way to a long neat low house nearly opposite to a little bridge over a brook which ran down the valley towards the north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ordered some ale and breadandbutter and whilst our repast was being got ready this bridge sir said john is called pont y velin castell the bridge of the castle mill the inn was formerly the mill of the castle and is still called melin y castell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as you are over this bridge you are in shire amwythig which the saxons call shropshire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little way up on yon hill is clawdd offa or offas dyke built of old by the brenin offa in order to keep us poor welsh within our bounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we stood on the bridge i inquired of jones the name of the brook the ceiriog sir said john the same river that we saw at pont y meibion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the river said i which huw morris loved so well whose praises he has sung and which he has introduced along with cefn uchaf in a stanza in which he describes the hospitality of chirk castle in his pe byddai r cefn ucha yn gig ac yn fara a cheiriog fawr yman fir aml bob tro rhy ryfedd fae iddyn barhau hanner blwyddyn i wyr bob yn gannyn ar ginio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a good penill that sir said john jones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pity that the halls of great people no longer flow with rivers of beer nor have mountains of bread and beef for all comers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no pity at all said i things are better as they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those mountains of bread and beef and those rivers of ale merely encouraged vassalage fawning and idleness better to pay for ones dinner proudly and independently at ones inn than to go and cringe for it at a great mans table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we crossed the bridge walked a little way up the hill which was beautifully wooded and then retraced our steps to the little inn where i found my wife and daughter waiting for us and very hungry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we sat down john jones with us and proceeded to despatch our breadandbutter and ale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the breadandbutter were good enough but the ale poorish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh for an act of parliament to force people to brew good ale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after finishing our humble meal we got up and having paid our reckoning went back into the park the gate of we strolled towards the north along the base of the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the imagination of man can scarcely conceive a scene more beautiful than the one which we were now enjoying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huge oaks studded the lower side of the hill towards the top was a belt of forest above which rose the eastern walls of the castle the whole forest castle and the green bosom of the hill glorified by the lustre of the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we proceeded we again roused the deer and again saw three old black fellows evidently the patriarchs of the herds with their white enormous horns with these ancient gentlefolks i very much wished to make acquaintance and tried to get near them but no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would suffer no such thing off they glided their white antlers like the barked top boughs of old pollards glancing in the sunshine the smaller dapple creatures following them bounding and frisking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had again got very near the castle when john jones told me that if we would follow him he would show us llun cawr he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on this point he could give me no information <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told my wife and daughter what he had said and finding that they wished to see the figure i bade john jones lead us to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he led us down an avenue just below the eastern side of the castle noble oaks and other trees composed it some of them probably near a hundred feet high john jones observing me looking at them with admiration they would make fine chests for the dead sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how calculated amidst the most bounding joy and bliss to remind man of his doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment before i had felt quite happy but now i felt sad and mournful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked at my wife and daughter who were gazing admiringly on the beauteous scenes around them and remembered that in a few short years at most we should all three be laid in the cold narrow house formed of four elm or oaken boards our only garment the flannel shroud the cold damp earth above us instead of the bright glorious sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i soon comforted myself however by reflecting that such is the will of heaven and that heaven is after we had descended the avenue some way john jones began to look about him and getting on the bank on the left side disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went on and in a little time saw him again beckoning to us some way farther down but still on the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we drew nigh to him he bade us get on the bank we did so and followed him some way midst furze and lyng <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all of a sudden he exclaimed there it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we looked and saw a large figure standing on a pedestal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on going up to it we found it to be a hercules leaning on his club indeed a copy of the farnese hercules as we gathered from an inscription in latin partly defaced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we felt rather disappointed as we expected that it would have turned out to be the figure of some huge welsh champion of old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john jones in order that we might properly appreciate the size of the statue by contrasting it with his own body got upon the pedestal and stood up beside the figure to the elbow of which his head i told him that in my country the eastern part of lloegr i had indeed sir said he who is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hales the norfolk giant i replied who has a sister seven inches shorter than himself who is yet seven inches taller than any man in the county when her brother is out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when john jones got down he asked me who the man was whom the erchwl i replied a mighty man of old who with club cleared the country of thieves serpents and monsters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i now proposed that we should return to llangollen whereupon we retraced our steps and had nearly reached the farmhouse of the castle when john jones said that we had better return by the low road by doing which we should see the castlelodge and also its gate which was considered one of the wonders of wales <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we followed his advice and passing by the front of the castle northwards soon came to the lodge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lodge had nothing remarkable in its on the top were two figures of wolves which john jones supposed to be those of foxes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wolf of chirk is not intended to be expressive of the northern name of its proprietor but as the armorial bearing of his family by the maternal side and originated in one ryred surnamed blaidd or wolf from his ferocity in war from whom the family which only assumed the name of middleton in the beginning of the thirteenth century on the occasion of its representative marrying a rich shropshire heiress of that name the wolf of chirk is a cambrian not a gothic wolf and though a a visitor apprenticeship to the law croch daranau lope de one morning as i sat alone a gentleman was announced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his entrance i recognised in him the magistrates clerk owing to whose good word as it appeared to me i had been permitted to remain during the examination into the affair of the wounded butcher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a stout strongmade man somewhat under the middle height with a ruddy face and very clear grey eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i handed him a chair which he took and said that his name was r and that he had taken the liberty of calling as he had a great desire to be acquainted with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on my asking him his reason for that desire he told me that it proceeded from his having read a book of mine about good said i you cant give an author a better reason for coming to see him than being pleased with his book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you that you are most welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a little general discourse i said that i presumed he was in yes said he i am a member of that muchabused profession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and unjustly abused said i it is a profession which abounds with honourable men and in which i believe there are fewer scamps than in any other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most honourable men i have ever known have been lawyers they were men whose word was their bond and who would have preferred ruin to breaking it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naught befell to tell of for some while but at last when it was drawing towards evening again they had been riding through a thick pinewood for a long while and coming out of it they beheld before them a plain country fairly well grassed but lo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the field not far from the roadside a pavilion pitched and a banner on the top thereof but the banner hung down about the staff so that the bearing was not seen and about this pavilion which was great and rich of fashion were many tents great and small and there were horses tethered in the field and men moving about the gleam of armour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this sight the minstrel drew rein and stared about him wildly but ralph said what is this is it the peril aforesaid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said ralph have we not the letpass what then can befall us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if this be other than the lord of utterbol he will see our letpass and let us alone or if it be he indeed what harm shall he do to the bearers of his own pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on then or else and therewith he half drew his sword is this lord of utterbol but another name for the devil in hell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the minstrel still stared wild and trembled then he stammered out i thought i should bring thee to utterness first and that some other should lead thee thence i did not look to see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he spake the wind arose and ran along the woodside and beat back from it and stirred the canvas of the tents and raised the folds of the banner and blew it out so that the bearing was clear to see yet ralph deemed it naught dreadful but an armoury fit for a baron to wit a black bear on a castlewall on a field of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as ralph sat on his horse gazing himseemed that men were looking towards him and a great horn was sounded hard by the pavilion then ralph looked toward the minstrel fiercely and laughed and said i see now that thou art another traitor so get thee gone i have more to do than the slaying of thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therewith he turned his horses head and smote the spurs into the sides of him and went a great gallop over the field on the right side of the road away from the gay pavilion but even therewith came a halfscore of horsemen from the camp as if they were awaiting him and they spurred after him straightway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the race was no long one for ralphs beast was wearied and the other horses were fresh and ralph knew naught of the country before him whereas those riders knew it well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore it was but a few minutes till they came up with him and he made no show of defence but suffered them to lead him away and he crossed the highway where he saw no token of the minstrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they brought him to the pavilion and made him dismount and led him in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dusk had fallen by now but within it was all bright with candles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pavilion was hung with rich silken cloth and at the further end on a carpet of the hunting was an ivory chair whereon sat a man who was the only one sitting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was clad in a gown of blue silk broidered with roundels beaten with the bear upon the castlewall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ralph deemed that this must be no other than the lord of utterbol yet after all the tales he had heard of that lord he seemed no such terrible man he was short of stature but broad across the shoulders his hair long strait and dark brown of hue and his beard scanty he was straightfeatured and smoothfaced and had been no illlooking man save that his skin was sallow and for his eyes which were brown small and somewhat bloodshot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside him stood morfinn bowed down with fear and not daring to look either at the lord or at ralph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore he knew for certain that when he had called him traitor even now that it was no more than the very sooth and that he had fallen into the trap though how or why he wotted not clearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then might his heart have fallen but so it was that when he looked into the face of this lord the terror of the lands hatred of him so beset his heart that it swallowed up fear in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> albeit he held himself well in hand for his soul was waxing and he deemed that he should yet do great deeds therefore he desired to live whatsoever pains or shame of the passing day he might suffer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this mighty lord spake and his voice was harsh and squeaking so that the sound of it was worse than the sight of his face and he said bring the man forth that i may see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they brought up ralph till he was eye to eye with the lord who turned to morfinn and said is this thy catch lucky man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea quavered morfinn not lifting his eyes will he do lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the lord how can i see him when he is all muffled up in steel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speedily then had they stripped ralph of hauberk and helm and arm and leg plates so that he stood up in his jerkin and breeches and the lord leaned forward to look on him as if he were cheapening a horse and then turned to a man somewhat stricken in years clad in scarlet who stood on his other hand and said to him well david the sage is this the sort of man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the elder put on a pair of spectacles and eyed ralph curiously a while and then said there are no two words to be said about it he is a goodly and wellfashioned a young man as was ever sold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said the lord turning towards morfinn the catch is good lucky man david will give thee gold for it and thou mayst go back west when thou wilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thou must be lucky again moreover because there are women needed for my house and they must be goodly and meek and not grievously marked with stripes or branded so that thou hadst best take them luckily if thou mayst and not buy them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now go for there are more than enough men under this woven roof and we need no halfmen to boot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said david the old man grinning he will hold him well paid if he go unscathed from before thee lord for he looked not to meet thee here but thought to bring the young man to utterness that he might be kept there till thou camest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lord said grimly he is not far wrong to fear me maybe but he shall go for this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if he bring me not those women within three months wearing and if there be but two uncomely ones amongst them let him look to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now take ye the new man and let him rest and give him meat and drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and look you david if he be not in condition when he cometh home to utterbol thou shalt pay for it in one way or other if not in thine own person since thou art old and deft of service then through those that be dear to thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david smiled on ralph and led him out unto a tent not far off and there he made much of him and bade bring meat and drink and all he needed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> withal he bade him not to try fleeing lest he be slain and he showed him how nigh the guards were and how many <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glad was the old man when he saw the captive put a good face on matters and that he was not downhearted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in sooth that hatred of the tyrant mingled with hope sustained ralphs heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been minded when he was brought before the lord to have shown the letter of the queen of goldburg and to defy him if he still held him captive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when he had beheld him and his fellowship a while he thought better of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for though they had abundance of rich plenishing and gay raiment and good weapons and armour howbeit of strange and uncouth fashion yet he deemed when he looked on them that they would scarce have the souls of men in their bodies but that they were utterly vile through and through like the shapes of an evil dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore he thought shame of it to show the queens letter to them even as if he had shown them the very naked body of her who had been so piteous kind to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he had no mind to wear his heart on his sleeve but would keep his own counsel and let his foemen speak and show what was in their minds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this cause he now made himself sweet and was of good cheer with old david deeming him to be a great men there as indeed he was being the chief counsellor of the lord of utterbol though forsooth not so much his counsellor as that he durst counsel otherwise than as the lord desired to go unless he thought that it would bring his said lord and therefore himself to very present peril and damage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short though this man had not been bought for money he was little better than a thrall of the higher sort as forsooth were all the lords men saving the best and trustiest of his warriors and these were men whom the lord somewhat feared himself though on the other hand he could not but know that they understood how the dread of the lord of utterbol was a shield to them and that if it were to die out amongst men their own skins were not worth many days purchase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so then david spake pleasantly with ralph and ate and drank with him and saw that he was well bedded for the night and left him in the first watch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ralph lay down in little more trouble than the night before when though he were being led friendly to utterness yet he had not been able to think what he should do when he came there whereas now he thought who knoweth what shall betide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for me there is nought to do save to lay hold of the occasion that another may give me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at the worst i scarce deem that i am being led to the slaughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now when it was morning they struck the tents and laded them on wains and went their ways the selfsame road that ralph had been minded for yesterday to wit the road to utterness but now must he ride it unarmed and guarded other shame had he none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed david who stuck close to his side all day was so sugary sweet with him and praised and encouraged him so diligently that ralph began to have misgivings that all this kindness was but as the flowergarlands wherewith the heathen times men were wont to deck the slaughterbeasts for the bloodoffering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea and into his mind came certain tales of how there were heathen men yet in the world who beguiled men and women and offered them up to their devils whom they called gods but all this ran off him soon when he bethought him how little wisdom there was in running to meet the evil which might be on the way and that way a rough and perilous one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he plucked up heart and spake freely and gaily with david and one or two others who rode anigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were amidst of the company the lord went first after his forerunners in a litter done about with precious cloths and two score horsemen came next fully armed after their manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then rode ralph with david and a half dozen of the magnates then came a sort of cooks and other serving men but none without a weapon and last another score of menatarms so that he saw that fleeing was not to be thought of though he was not bound and save for lack of weapons rode like a free man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day was clear as yesterday had been wherefore again ralph saw the distant mountaintop like a cloud and he gazed at it long till david said i see that thou art gazing hard at the mountains and perchance art longing to be beyond them were it but to see what like the land is on the further side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if all tales be true thou art best this side thereof whatever thy lot may be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea said david but that is not all since he is not asleep elsewhere in the world but men say that over there are things to be seen which might slay a strong man for pure fear without stroke of sword or dint of axe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea said ralph but how was it then with him that builded goldburg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o said david hast thou heard that tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well they say of him who certes went over those mountains and drank of the well at the worlds end that he was one of the lucky yet for all his luck never had he drunk the draught had he not been helped by one who had learned many things a woman to wit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he was one of them with whom all women are in love and thence indeed was his luck....moreover when all is said tis but a tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea quoth ralph laughing even as the tales of the ghosts and bugs that abide the wayfarer on the other side of yonder white moveless cloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david laughed in his turn and said thou hast me there and whether or no these tales are nothing to us who shall never leave utterbol again while we live save in such a company as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he held his peace but presently spake again hast thou heard anything then of those tales of the well at the worlds end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean others beside that concerning the lord of goldburg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea surely i have said ralph nowise changing countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deemest thou that it may be true that a man may drink of the well and recover his youth thereby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ralph laughed and said master it is rather for me to ask thee hereof than thou me since thou dwellest so much nigher thereto than i have done heretofore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david drew up close to him and said softly nigher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said david is it so nigh that a man may leave home and come thereto in his lifetime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea said ralph in my tales it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the old man still softlier had i deemed that true i had tried the adventure whatever might lie beyond the mountains but and he sighed withal i deem it untrue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therewith dropped the talk of that matter and in sooth ralph was loath to make many words thereof lest his eagerness shine through and all the story of him be known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anon it was noon and the lord bade all men stay for meat so his serving men busied them about his dinner and david went with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the menatarms bade ralph sit among them and share their meat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they sat down all by the wayside and they spake kindly and friendly to ralph and especially their captain a man somewhat low of stature but longarmed like the lord a man of middle age beardless and spare of body but wiry and toughlooking with hair of the hue of the dust of the sandstone quarry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this man fell atalking with ralph and asked him of the manner of tilting and courteous jousting between knights in the countries of knighthood till that talk dropped between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then ralph looked round upon the land which had now worsened again and was little better than rough moorland little fed and not at all tilled and he said this is but a sorry land for earths increase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said the captain i wot not it beareth plover and whimbrel and conies and hares yea and men withal some few <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and whereas it beareth naught else that cometh of my lords will for deemest thou that he should suffer a rich land betwixt him and goldburg that it might sustain an host big enough to deal with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none shall dwell in it save as he willeth and they shall pay him tribute be it never so little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet some there are of them who are to him as the hounds be to the hunter and these same he even wageth so that if aught rare and goodly cometh their way they shall bring it to his hands as thou thyself knowest to thy cost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea said ralph smiling and is morfinn the unmanned one of these curs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea said the captain with a grin and one of the richest of them in despite of his fiddle and minstrels gear and his lack of manhood for he is one of the cunningest of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my lord unmanned him for some good reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ralph kept silence and while and then said why doth the goldburg folk suffer all this felony robbery and confusion so near their borders and the land debateable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the captain and again he grinned passing for thy hard words sir knight why dost thou suffer me to lead thee along whither thou wouldest not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the captain even so it is with the goldburg folk if they raise hand against some of these strongthieves or manstealers he has but to send the wararrow round about these deserts as ye deem them and he will presently have as rough a company of carles for his fellows as need be say ten hundred of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the goldburg folk are not very handy at a fray without their walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forsooth within them it is another matter and beside not even our lord of utterbol would see goldburg broken down no not for all that he might win there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it deemed a holy place in the land then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wot not the meaning of holy said the other but all we deem that when goldburg shall fall the world shall change so that living therein shall be hard to them that have not drunk of the water of the well at the worlds end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ralph was silent a while and eyed the captain curiously then he said have the goldburgers so drunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the captain nay nay but the word goes that under each tower of goldburg lieth a youth and a maiden that have drunk of the water and might not die save by point and edge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then was ralph silent again for once more he fell pondering the matter if he had been led away to be offered as a blood offering to some of evil gods of the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as he pondered a flourish of trumpets was blown and all men sprang up and the captain said to ralph now hath our lord done his dinner and we must to horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anon they were on the way again and they rode long and saw little change in the aspect of the land neither did that cloudlike token of the distant mountains grow any greater or clearer to ralphs deeming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little before sunset they made halt for the night and ralph was shown to a tent as erst and had meat and drink good enough brought to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but somewhat after he had done eating comes david to him and says up young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and come to my lord he asketh for thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea that is a proper question to ask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quoth david as though the knife should ask the cutler what wilt thou cut with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dost thou deem that i durst ask him of his will with thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am ready to go with thee said ralph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they went forth but ralphs heart fell and he sickened at the thought of seeing that man again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless he set his face as brass and thrust back both his fear and his hatred for a fitter occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon they came into the pavilion of the lord who was sitting there as yester eve save that his gown was red and done about with gold and turquoise and emerald <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david brought ralph nigh to his seat but spake not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mighty lord was sitting with his head drooping and his arm hanging over his knee with a heavy countenance as though he were brooding matters which pleased him naught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in a while he sat up with a start and turned about and saw david standing there with ralph and spake at once like a man waking up he that sold thee to me said that thou wert of avail for many things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ralph so hated him that he was of half a mind to answer naught save by smiting him to slay him but there was no weapon anigh and life was sweet to him with all the tale that was lying ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he answered coldly it is sooth lord that i can do more than one deed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the lord canst thou break a wild horse and shoe him and physic him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we may meet again sooner than you think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so keep a good heart and dont miss the seven oclock train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it gives one courage to hear your voice again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please to offer my duty to my lady and say i left all the things as tidy as i could in the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it really breaks my heart miss to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i got back to the house i had only a quarter of an hour to spare to put myself in order for dinner and to say two words to laura before i went downstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the letters are in fannys hands i whispered to her at the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to join us at dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he frightened me by a thump on the door outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you alter your mind and tell me the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sooner or later ill wring it out of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know where anne catherick is at this moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill crush your obstinacymind that!ill wring it out of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went away with those wordswent away marian hardly five minutes ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were safe for that nighthe had not found her yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont be uneasy if i am a little latei must be careful not to give offence by leaving them too soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir percival took madame fosco into the diningroom and the count gave me his arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was hot and flushed and was not dressed with his customary care and completeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he too been out before dinner and been late in getting back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or was he only suffering from the heat a little more severely than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however this might be he was unquestionably troubled by some secret annoyance or anxiety which with all his powers of deception he was not able entirely to conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the whole of dinner he was almost as silent as sir percival himself and he every now and then looked at his wife with an expression of furtive uneasiness which was quite new in my experience of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the one social obligation which he seemed to be selfpossessed enough to perform as carefully as ever was the obligation of being persistently civil and attentive to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what vile object he has in view i cannot still discover but be the design what it may invariable politeness towards myself invariable humility towards laura and invariable suppression at any cost of sir percivals clumsy violence have been the means he has resolutely and impenetrably used to get to his end ever since he set foot in this house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suspected it when he first interfered in our favour on the day when the deed was produced in the library and i feel certain of it now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when madame fosco and i rose to leave the table the count rose also to accompany us back to the drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going away because i have had dinner enough and wine enough answered the count <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be so kind percival as to make allowances for my foreign habit of going out with the ladies as well as coming in with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want half an hours quiet talk with you over our wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a quiet talk percival with all my heart but not now and not over the wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later in the evening if you pleaselater in the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> civil behaviour upon my soul to a man in his own house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had more than once seen him look at the count uneasily during dinnertime and had observed that the count carefully abstained from looking at him in return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this circumstance coupled with the hosts anxiety for a little quiet talk over the wine and the guests obstinate resolution not to sit down again at the table revived in my memory the request which sir percival had vainly addressed to his friend earlier in the day to come out of the library and speak to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the count had deferred granting that private interview when it was first asked for in the afternoon and had again deferred granting it when it was a second time asked for at the dinnertable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever the coming subject of discussion between them might be it was clearly an important subject in sir percivals estimationand perhaps judging from his evident reluctance to approach it a dangerous subject as well in the estimation of the count <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these considerations occurred to me while we were passing from the diningroom to the drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir percivals angry commentary on his friends desertion of him had not produced the slightest effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the count obstinately accompanied us to the teatable waited a minute or two in the roomwent out into the halland returned with the postbag in his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was then eight oclockthe hour at which the letters were always despatched from blackwater park <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you any letter for the post miss halcombe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw madame fosco who was making the tea pause with the sugar tongs in her hand to listen for my answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave the bag to the servant who was then in the room sat down at the piano and played the air of the lively neapolitan street song la mia carolina twice over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife who was usually the most deliberate of women in all her movements made the tea as quickly as i could have made it myselffinished her own cup in two minutes and quietly glided out of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rose to follow her examplepartly because i suspected her of attempting some treachery upstairs with laura partly because i was resolved not to remain alone in the same room with her husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before i could get to the door the count stopped me by a request for a cup of tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave him the cup of tea and tried a second time to get away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped me againthis time by going back to the piano and suddenly appealing to me on a musical question in which he declared that the honour of his country was concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i vainly pleaded my own total ignorance of music and total want of taste in that direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he only appealed to me again with a vehemence which set all further protest on my part at defiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the english and the germans he indignantly declared were always reviling the italians for their inability to cultivate the higher kinds of music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were perpetually talking of our oratorios and they were perpetually talking of their symphonies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did we forget and did they forget his immortal friend and countryman rossini <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was moses in egypt but a sublime oratorio which was acted on the stage instead of being coldly sung in a concertroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was the overture to guillaume tell but a symphony under another name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would i listen to this and this and this and say if anything more sublimely sacred and grand had ever been composed by mortal man?and without waiting for a word of assent or dissent on my part looking me hard in the face all the time he began thundering on the piano and singing to it with loud and lofty enthusiasmonly interrupting himself at intervals to announce to me fiercely the titles of the different pieces of music chorus of egyptians in the plague of darkness miss halcombe!recitativo of moses with the tables of the law.prayer of israelites at the passage of the red sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the piano trembled under his powerful hands and the teacups on the table rattled as his big bass voice thundered out the notes and his heavy foot beat time on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something horriblesomething fierce and devilishin the outburst of his delight at his own singing and playing and in the triumph with which he watched its effect upon me as i shrank nearer and nearer to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was released at last not by my own efforts but by sir percivals interposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he opened the diningroom door and called out angrily to know what that infernal noise meant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the count instantly got up from the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if percival is coming he said harmony and melody are both at an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the muse of music miss halcombe deserts us in dismay and i the fat old minstrel exhale the rest of my enthusiasm in the open air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stalked out into the verandah put his hands in his pockets and resumed the recitativo of moses sotto voce in the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard sir percival call after him from the diningroom window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he took no noticehe seemed determined not to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that longdeferred quiet talk between them was still to be put off was still to wait for the counts absolute will and pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had detained me in the drawingroom nearly half an hour from the time when his wife left us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where had she been and what had she been doing in that interval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went upstairs to ascertain but i made no discoveries and when i questioned laura i found that she had not heard anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody had disturbed her no faint rustling of the silk dress had been audible either in the anteroom or in the passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after going to my room to get my journal i returned and sat with laura sometimes writing sometimes stopping to talk with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then rose said my last cheering words and wished her goodnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she locked her door again after we had arranged that i should come in and see her the first thing in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a few sentences more to add to my diary before going to bed myself and as i went down again to the drawingroom after leaving laura for the last time that weary day i resolved merely to show myself there to make my excuses and then to retire an hour earlier than usual for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir percival and the count and his wife were sitting together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir percival was yawning in an easychair the count was reading madame fosco was fanning herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strange to say her face was flushed now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she who never suffered from the heat was most undoubtedly suffering from it tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid countess you are not quite so well as usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very remark i was about to make to you she replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time she had ever addressed me with that familiarity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an insolent smile too on her face when she said the words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am suffering from one of my bad headaches i answered coldly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a walk before dinner would have been just the thing for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she referred to the walk with a strange emphasis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the letters were safe now in fannys hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come and have a smoke fosco said sir percival rising with another uneasy look at his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with pleasure percival when the ladies have gone to bed replied the count <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me countess if i set you the example of retiring i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only remedy for such a headache as mine is going to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the same insolent smile on the womans face when i shook hands with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was looking impatiently at madame fosco who showed no signs of leaving the room with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the count smiled to himself behind his book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was yet another delay to that quiet talk with sir percivaland the countess was the impediment this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> june th.once safely shut into my own room i opened these pages and prepared to go on with that part of the days record which was still left to write <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for ten minutes or more i sat idle with the pen in my hand thinking over the events of the last twelve hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i at last addressed myself to my task i found a difficulty in proceeding with it which i had never experienced before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of my efforts to fix my thoughts on the matter in hand they wandered away with the strangest persistency in the one direction of sir percival and the count and all the interest which i tried to concentrate on my journal centred instead in that private interview between them which had been put off all through the day and which was now to take place in the silence and solitude of the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this perverse state of my mind the recollection of what had passed since the morning would not come back to me and there was no resource but to close my journal and to get away from it for a little while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i opened the door which led from my bedroom into my sittingroom and having passed through pulled it to again to prevent any accident in case of draught with the candle left on the dressing table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my sittingroom window was wide open and i leaned out listlessly to look at the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a smell like rain in the still heavy air and i put my hand out of window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rain was only threatening it had not come yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remained leaning on the windowsill for nearly a quarter of an hour looking out absently into the black darkness and hearing nothing except now and then the voices of the servants or the distant sound of a closing door in the lower part of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as i was turning away wearily from the window to go back to the bedroom and make a second attempt to complete the unfinished entry in my journal i smelt the odour of tobaccosmoke stealing towards me on the heavy night air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next moment i saw a tiny red spark advancing from the farther end of the house in the pitch darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard no footsteps and i could see nothing but the spark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it travelled along in the night passed the window at which i was standing and stopped opposite my bedroom window inside which i had left the light burning on the dressingtable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spark remained stationary for a moment then moved back again in the direction from which it had advanced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i followed its progress i saw a second red spark larger than the first approaching from the distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remembering who smoked cigarettes and who smoked cigars i inferred immediately that the count had come out first to look and listen under my window and that sir percival had afterwards joined him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they must both have been walking on the lawnor i should certainly have heard sir percivals heavy footfall though the counts soft step might have escaped me even on the gravel walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i waited quietly at the window certain that they could neither of them see me in the darkness of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard sir percival say in a low voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont you come in and sit down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to see the light out of that window replied the count softly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it shows she is not in bed yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is sharp enough to suspect something and bold enough to come downstairs and listen if she can get the chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my good friend you are on the edge of your domestic precipice and if i let you give the women one other chance on my sacred word of honour they will push you over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will come to our explanations percival when the light is out of that window and when i have had one little look at the rooms on each side of the library and a peep at the staircase as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they slowly moved away and the rest of the conversation between them which had been conducted throughout in the same low tones ceased to be audible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had heard enough to determine me on justifying the counts opinion of my sharpness and my courage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the red sparks were out of sight in the darkness i had made up my mind that there should be a listener when those two men sat down to their talkand that the listener in spite of all the counts precautions to the contrary should be myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted but one motive to sanction the act to my own conscience and to give me courage enough for performing itand that motive i had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lauras honour lauras happinesslauras life itselfmight depend on my quick ears and my faithful memory tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had heard the count say that he meant to examine the rooms on each side of the library and the staircase as well before he entered on any explanation with sir percival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this expression of his intentions was necessarily sufficient to inform me that the library was the room in which he proposed that the conversation should take place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the one moment of time which was long enough to bring me to that conclusion was also the moment which showed me a means of baffling his precautionsor in other words of hearing what he and sir percival said to each other without the risk of descending at all into the lower regions of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in speaking of the rooms on the ground floor i have mentioned incidentally the verandah outside them on which they all opened by means of french windows extending from the cornice to the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the top of this verandah was flat the rainwater being carried off from it by pipes into tanks which helped to supply the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the narrow leaden roof which ran along past the bedrooms and which was rather less i should think than three feet below the sills of the window a row of flowerpots was ranged with wide intervals between each potthe whole being protected from falling in high winds by an ornamental iron railing along the edge of the roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plan which had now occurred to me was to get out at my sittingroom window on to this roof to creep along noiselessly till i reached that part of it which was immediately over the library window and to crouch down between the flowerpots with my ear against the outer railing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if sir percival and the count sat and smoked tonight as i had seen them sitting and smoking many nights before with their chairs close at the open window and their feet stretched on the zinc garden seats which were placed under the verandah every word they said to each other above a whisper and no long conversation as we all know by experience can be carried on in a whisper must inevitably reach my ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if on the other hand they chose tonight to sit far back inside the room then the chances were that i should hear little or nothingand in that case i must run the far more serious risk of trying to outwit them downstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strongly as i was fortified in my resolution by the desperate nature of our situation i hoped most fervently that i might escape this last emergency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my courage was only a womans courage after all and it was very near to failing me when i thought of trusting myself on the ground floor at the dead of night within reach of sir percival and the count <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went softly back to my bedroom to try the safer experiment of the verandah roof first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a complete change in my dress was imperatively necessary for many reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took off my silk gown to begin with because the slightest noise from it on that still night might have betrayed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i next removed the white and cumbersome parts of my underclothing and replaced them by a petticoat of dark flannel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over this i put my black travelling cloak and pulled the hood on to my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in my ordinary evening costume i took up the room of three men at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in my present dress when it was held close about me no man could have passed through the narrowest spaces more easily than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little breadth left on the roof of the verandah between the flowerpots on one side and the wall and the windows of the house on the other made this a serious consideration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i knocked anything down if i made the least noise who could say what the consequences might be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only waited to put the matches near the candle before i extinguished it and groped my way back into the sittingroom i locked that door as i had locked my bedroom doorthen quietly got out of the window and cautiously set my feet on the leaden roof of the verandah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my two rooms were at the inner extremity of the new wing of the house in which we all lived and i had five windows to pass before i could reach the position it was necessary to take up immediately over the library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first window belonged to a spare room which was empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second and third windows belonged to lauras room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fourth window belonged to sir percivals room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others by which it was not necessary for me to pass were the windows of the counts dressingroom of the bathroom and of the second empty spare room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sound reached my earsthe black blinding darkness of the night was all round me when i first stood on the verandah except at that part of it which madame foscos window overlooked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there at the very place above the library to which my course was directedthere i saw a gleam of light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was too late to draw backit was no time to wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i determined to go on at all hazards and trust for security to my own caution and to the darkness of the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought to myself as i took the first step forward on the roof with one hand holding my cloak close round me and the other groping against the wall of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was better to brush close by the wall than to risk striking my feet against the flowerpots within a few inches of me on the other side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i passed the dark window of the spare room trying the leaden roof at each step with my foot before i risked resting my weight on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i passed the dark windows of lauras room god bless her and keep her tonight! <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i passed the dark window of sir percivals room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i waited a moment knelt down with my hands to support me and so crept to my position under the protection of the low wall between the bottom of the lighted window and the verandah roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i ventured to look up at the window itself i found that the top of it only was open and that the blind inside was drawn down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while i was looking i saw the shadow of madame fosco pass across the white field of the blindthen pass slowly back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus far she could not have heard me or the shadow would surely have stopped at the blind even if she had wanted courage enough to open the window and look out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i placed myself sideways against the railing of the verandah first ascertaining by touching them the position of the flower pots on either side of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was room enough for me to sit between them and no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sweetscented leaves of the flower on my left hand just brushed my cheek as i lightly rested my head against the railing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first sounds that reached me from below were caused by the opening or closing most probably the latter of three doors in successionthe doors no doubt leading into the hall and into the rooms on each side of the library which the count had pledged himself to examine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first object that i saw was the red spark again travelling out into the night from under the verandah moving away towards my window waiting a moment and then returning to the place from which it had set out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his exclamation was followed by the scraping of the garden chairs on the tiled pavement under the verandahthe welcome sound which told me they were going to sit close at the window as usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clock in the turret struck the quarter to twelve as they settled themselves in their chairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard madame fosco through the open window yawning and saw her shadow pass once more across the white field of the blind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile sir percival and the count began talking together below now and then dropping their voices a little lower than usual but never sinking them to a whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well well said the rat presently i suppose we ought to be thinking about turning in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rat said the mole i simply cant go and turn in and go to sleep and do nothing even though there doesnt seem to be anything to be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well get the boat out and paddle up stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon will be up in an hour or so and then we will search as well as we cananyhow it will be better than going to just what i was thinking myself said the rat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not the sort of night for bed anyhow and daybreak is not so very far off and then we may pick up some news of him from early risers they got the boat out and the rat took the sculls paddling with caution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out in midstream there was a clear narrow track that faintly reflected the sky but wherever shadows fell on the water from bank bush or tree they were as solid to all appearance as the banks themselves and the mole had to steer with judgment accordingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dark and deserted as it was the night was full of small noises song and chatter and rustling telling of the busy little population who were up and about plying their trades and vocations through the night till sunshine should fall on them at last and send them off to their wellearned repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the waters own noises too were more apparent than by day its gurglings and cloops more unexpected and near at hand and constantly they started at what seemed a sudden clear call from an actual articulate voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the line of the horizon was clear and hard against the sky and in one particular quarter it showed black against a silvery climbing phosphorescence that grew and grew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last over the rim of the waiting earth the moon lifted with slow majesty till it swung clear of the horizon and rode off free of moorings and once more they began to see surfacesmeadows widespread and quiet gardens and the river itself from bank to bank all softly disclosed all washed clean of mystery and terror all radiant again as by day but with a difference that was tremendous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their old haunts greeted them again in other raiment as if they had slipped away and put on this pure new apparel and come quietly back smiling as they shyly waited to see if they would be recognised again under it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fastening their boat to a willow the friends landed in this silent silver kingdom and patiently explored the hedges the hollow trees the runnels and their little culverts the ditches and dry waterways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> embarking again and crossing over they worked their way up the stream in this manner while the moon serene and detached in a cloudless sky did what she could though so far off to help them in their quest till her hour came and she sank earthwards reluctantly and left them and mystery once more held field and river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a change began slowly to declare itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the horizon became clearer field and tree came more into sight and somehow with a different look the mystery began to drop away from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a bird piped suddenly and was still and a light breeze sprang up and set the reeds and bulrushes rustling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rat who was in the stern of the boat while mole sculled sat up suddenly and listened with a passionate intentness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mole who with gentle strokes was just keeping the boat moving while he scanned the banks with care looked at him with curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sighed the rat sinking back in his seat again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since it was to end so soon i almost wish i had never heard it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it has roused a longing in me that is pain and nothing seems worth while but just to hear that sound once more and go on listening to it for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> entranced he was silent for a long space spellbound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it passes on and i begin to lose it he said presently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the merry bubble and joy the thin clear happy call of the distant piping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such music i never dreamed of and the call in it is stronger even than the music is sweet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the music and the call must be the mole greatly wondering obeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hear nothing myself he the rat never answered if indeed he heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rapt transported trembling he was possessed in all his senses by this new divine thing that caught up his helpless soul and swung and dandled it a powerless but happy infant in a strong sustaining grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in silence mole rowed steadily and soon they came to a point where the river divided a long backwater branching off to one side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a slight movement of his head rat who had long dropped the rudderlines directed the rower to take the backwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the creeping tide of light gained and gained and now they could see the colour of the flowers that gemmed the waters edge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clearer and nearer still cried the rat joyously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you breathless and transfixed the mole stopped rowing as the liquid run of that glad piping broke on him like a wave caught him up and possessed him utterly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the tears on his comrades cheeks and bowed his head and understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a space they hung there brushed by the purple loosestrife that fringed the bank then the clear imperious summons that marched handinhand with the intoxicating melody imposed its will on mole and mechanically he bent to his oars again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the light grew steadily stronger but no birds sang as they were wont to do at the approach of dawn and but for the heavenly music all was marvellously still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on either side of them as they glided onwards the rich meadowgrass seemed that morning of a freshness and a greenness unsurpassable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had they noticed the roses so vivid the willowherb so riotous the meadowsweet so odorous and pervading <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the murmur of the approaching weir began to hold the air and they felt a consciousness that they were nearing the end whatever it might be that surely awaited their expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was mowing and mumbling and gesticulating and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor the regular thing you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a celebrity from asia so he said and that was enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that sort of evidence was as good as gold and passed current everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellows terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face of the globe was doing at the moment and what he had done at any time in the past and what he would do at any time in the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked if any would like to know what the emperor of the east was doing now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands made eloquent answer this reverend crowd would like to know what that monarch was at just as this moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fraud went through some more mummery and then made the high and mighty emperor of the east doth at this moment put money in the palm of a holy begging friar one two three pieces and they be all of silver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a buzz of admiring exclamations broke out all it is marvelous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what study what labor to have acquired a so amazing power as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would they like to know what the supreme lord of inde was doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told them what the supreme lord of inde was doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he told them what the sultan of egypt was at also what the king of the remote seas was about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so on and so on and with each new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time but no he never had to hesitate he always knew and always with unerring precision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw that if this thing went on i should lose my supremacy this fellow would capture my following i should be left out in the cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must put a cog in his wheel and do it right away if i might ask i should very greatly like to know what a certain person is doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more difficult it is the more certainly will i reveal it to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i was working up the interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was getting pretty high too you could see that by the craning necks all around and the halfsuspended if you make no mistake if you tell me truly what i want to know i will give you two hundred silver pennies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell you what you would know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tell me what i am doing with my right hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had not occurred to anybody in the crowd that simple trick of inquiring about somebody who wasnt ten thousand miles away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the magician was hit hard it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before and it corked him he didnt know how to meet it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked stunned confused he couldnt say a word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come i said what are you waiting for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it possible you can answer up right off and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is doing and yet cant tell what a person is doing who isnt three yards from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> persons behind me know what i am doing with my right hand they will indorse you if you tell correctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well ill tell you why you dont speak up and tell it is because you dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good friends this tramp is a mere fraud and liar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not used to hearing these awful beings called names and they did not know what might be the con sequence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a dead silence now superstitious bodings were in every mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the magician began to pull his wits together and when he presently smiled an easy nonchalant smile it spread a mighty relief around for it indicated that his mood was not destruc it hath struck me speechless the frivolity of this persons speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let all know if perchance there be any who know it not that enchanters of my degree deign not to concern themselves with the doings of any but kings princes emperors them that be born in the purple and them only <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had ye asked me what arthur the great king is doing it were another matter and i had told ye but the doings of a subject interest me not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you said anybody and so i supposed anybody included well anybody that is everybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doth anybody that is of lofty birth and the better if he be royal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it meseemeth might well be said the abbot who saw his opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster for it were not likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be born near to the summits of greatness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our arthur the king would you know of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody was full of awe and interest again right away the incorrigible idiots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they watched the incan tations absorbingly and looked at me with a there now what can you say to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> air when the the king is weary with the chase and lieth in his palace these two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the abbot and crossed himself may that sleep be to the refresh ment of his body and his soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it might be if he were sleeping i said but the king is not sleeping the king rides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was trouble again a conflict of authority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody knew which of us to believe i still had some reputation left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the magicians scorn was stirred and lo i have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and magicians in my life days but none be fore that could sit idle and see to the heart of things with never an incantation to help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have lived in the woods and lost much by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i use incantations myself as this good brotherhood are aware but only on occasions of moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it comes to sarcasming i reckon i know how to keep my end up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abbot inquired after the queen and the court and they be all on sleep being overcome by fatigue like as to the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half of them are about their amusements the queen and the other half are not sleeping they ride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now perhaps you can spread yourself a little and tell us where the king and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sleep now as i said but on the morrow they will ride for they go a journey toward the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and where will they be the day after tomorrow at vespers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far to the north of camelot and half their journey will be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is another lie by the space of a hundred and fifty miles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their journey will not be merely half done it will be all done and they will be here in this valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it set the abbot and the monks in a whirl of excitement and it rocked the en if the king does not arrive i will have myself ridden on a rail if he does i will ride you on a rail instead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next day i went up to the telephone office and found that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spotted his progress on the succeeding day in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third days reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming there seemed to be no preparations making to receive him in state a strange thing truly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only one thing could explain this that other magician had been cut ting under me sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked a friend of mine a monk about it and he said yes the magician had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all but stay at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in history and the only one within their memory that had a positive value and yet here they were ready to take up with an adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however it was not good politics to let the king come without any fuss and feathers at all so i went down and drummed up a procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and started them out at two oclock to meet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that was the sort of state he arrived in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abbot was helpless with rage and humiliation when i brought him out on a balcony and showed him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to offer him welcome and no stir of life or clang of joybell to glad his spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next minute the bells were dinning furiously and the various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns who went swarming in a rush toward the coming pro cession and with them went that magician and he was on a rail too by the abbots order and his reputation was in the mud and mine was in the sky again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes a man can keep his trademark current in such a country but he cant sit around and do it he has got to be on deck and attending to business right along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the king traveled for change of air or made a progress or visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost of his keep part of the administration moved with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the commission charged with the ex amination of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the valley whereas they could have transacted their business just as well at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and although this expedition was strictly a holiday excur sion for the king he kept some of his business func tions going just the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he touched for the evil as usual he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases for he was himself chief justice of the kings bench <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shone very well in this latter office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a wise and humane judge and he clearly did his honest best and fairest according to his lights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his lights i mean his rearing often colored his decisions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever there was a dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree the kings leanings and sympathies were for the former class always whether he suspected it or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was impossible that this should be otherwise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholders moral perceptions are known and conceded the world over and a privileged class an aristocracy is but a band of slaveholders under another name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this has a harsh sound and yet should not be offensive to any even to the noble himself unless the fact itself be an offense for the statement simply formulates a fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sons who could not understand why he did this asked him the these three trees which i cannot see without sorrow were planted by me on this spot when i was a youth of twenty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a celebrated magician who had given the seed to my father promised him that they would grow into the three finest trees the world had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father did not live to see his words come true but on his deathbed he bade me transplant them here and to look after them with the greatest care which i accordingly did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last after the lapse of five long years i noticed some blossoms on the branches and a few days later the most exquisite fruit my eyes had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave my headgardener the strictest orders to watch the trees carefully for the magician had warned my father that if one unripe fruit were plucked from the tree all the rest would become rotten at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it was quite ripe the fruit would become a golden yellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every day i gazed on the lovely fruit which became gradually more and more temptinglooking and it was all i could do not to one night i dreamt that the fruit was perfectly ripe i ate some of it and it was more delicious than anything i had ever tasted in real life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i awoke i sent for the gardener and asked him if the fruit on the three trees had not ripened in the night to perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but instead of replying the gardener threw himself at my feet and swore that he was innocent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that he had watched by the trees all night but in spite of it and as if by magic the beautiful trees had been robbed of all their fruit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grieved as i was over the theft i did not punish the gardener of whose fidelity i was well assured but i determined to pluck off all the fruit in the following year before it was ripe as i had not much belief in the magicians warning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i carried out my intention and had all the fruit picked off the tree but when i tasted one of the apples it was bitter and unpleasant and the next morning the rest of the fruit had all rotted away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after this i had the beautiful fruit of these trees carefully guarded by my most faithful servants but every year on this very night the fruit was plucked and stolen by an invisible hand and next morning not a single apple remained on the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some time past i have given up even having the trees when the king had finished his story szabo his eldest son said to him forgive me father if i say i think you are mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure there are many men in your kingdom who could protect these trees from the cunning arts of a thieving magician i myself who as your eldest son claim the first right to do so the king consented and as soon as evening drew on szabo climbed up on to one of the trees determined to protect the fruit even if it cost him his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he kept watch half the night but a little after midnight he was overcome by an irresistible drowsiness and fell fast asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not awake till it was bright daylight and all the fruit on the trees had vanished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following year warza the second brother tried his luck but with the same result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it came to the turn of the third and youngest son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iwanich was not the least discouraged by the failure of his elder brothers though they were both much older and stronger than he was and when night came climbed up the tree as they had done the moon had risen and with her soft light lit up the whole neighbourhood so that the observant prince could distinguish the smallest object distinctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at midnight a gentle west wind shook the tree and at the same moment a snowwhite swanlike bird sank down gently on his breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prince hastily seized the birds wings in his hands when lo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his astonishment he found he was holding in his arms not a bird but the most beautiful girl he had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you need not fear militza said the beautiful girl looking at the prince with friendly eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an evil magician has not robbed you of your fruit but he stole the seed from my mother and thereby caused her death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she was dying she bade me take the fruit which you have no right to possess from the trees every year as soon as it was ripe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i would have done tonight too if you had not seized me with such force and so iwanich who had been prepared to meet a terrible magician and not a lovely girl fell desperately in love with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they spent the rest of the night in pleasant conversation and when militza wished to go away he begged her not to leave him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would gladly stay with you longer said militza but a wicked witch once cut off a lock of my hair when i was asleep which has put me in her power and if morning were still to find having said these words she drew a sparkling diamond ring from her finger which she handed to the prince saying keep this ring in memory of militza and think of her sometimes if you never see her again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if your love is really true come and find me in my own kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may not show you the way there but this ring will guide you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you have love and courage enough to undertake this journey whenever you come to a crossroad always look at this diamond before you settle which way you are going to take <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it sparkles as brightly as ever go straight on but if its lustre is then militza bent over the prince and kissed him on his forehead and before he had time to say a word she vanished through the branches of the tree in a little white cloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morning broke and the prince still full of the wonderful apparition left his perch and returned to the palace like one in a dream without even knowing if the fruit had been taken or not for his whole mind was absorbed by thoughts of militza and how he was to find her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as the headgardener saw the prince going towards the palace he ran to the trees and when he saw them laden with ripe fruit he hastened to tell the king the joyful news <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king was beside himself for joy and hurried at once to the garden and made the gardener pick him some of the fruit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tasted it and found the apple quite as luscious as it had been in his dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went at once to his son iwanich and after embracing him tenderly and heaping praises on him he asked him how he had succeeded in protecting the costly fruit from the power of the magician <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as he did not want the real story to be known he said that about midnight a huge wasp had flown through the branches and buzzed incessantly round him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had warded it off with his sword and at dawn when he was becoming quite worn out the wasp had vanished as suddenly as it had appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king who never doubted the truth of this tale bade his son go to rest at once and recover from the fatigues of the night but he himself went and ordered many feasts to be held in honour of the preservation of the wonderful fruit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole capital was in a stir and everyone shared in the kings joy the prince alone took no part in the festivities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the king was at a banquet iwanich took some purses of gold and mounting the quickest horse in the royal stable he sped off like the wind without a single soul being any the wiser <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only on the next day that they missed him the king was very distressed at his disappearance and sent searchparties all over the kingdom to look for him but in vain and after six months they gave him up as dead and in another six months they had forgotten all about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the meantime the prince with the help of his ring had had a most successful journey and no evil had befallen him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of three months he came to the entrance of a huge forest which looked as if it had never been trodden by human foot before and which seemed to stretch out indefinitely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prince was about to enter the wood by a little path he had discovered when he heard a voice shouting to him hold youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iwanich turned round and saw a tall gauntlooking man clad in miserable rags leaning on a crooked staff and seated at the foot of an oak tree which was so much the same colour as himself that it was little wonder the prince had ridden past the tree without noticing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its easily seen that you have heard nothing of this forest that you rush so blindly to meet your doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well listen to me before you ride any further let me tell you that this wood hides in its depths a countless number of the fiercest tigers hyenas wolves bears and snakes and all sorts of other monsters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were to cut you and your horse up into tiny morsels and throw them to the beasts there wouldnt be one bit for each hundred of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take my advice therefore and if you wish to save your life follow the prince was rather taken aback by the old mans words and considered for a minute what he should do then looking at his ring and perceiving that it sparkled as brightly as ever he called out if this wood held even more terrible things than it here he spurred his horse and rode on but the old beggar screamed so loudly after him that the prince turned round and rode back to the oak tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am really sorry for you said the beggar but if you are quite determined to brave the dangers of the forest let me at least give you a piece of advice which will help you against these monsters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take this bagful of breadcrumbs and this live hare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will make you a present of them both as i am anxious to save your life but you must leave your horse behind you for it would stumble over the fallen trees or get entangled in the briers and thorns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you have gone about a hundred yards into the wood the wild beasts will surround you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you must instantly seize your bag and scatter the breadcrumbs among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will rush to eat them up greedily and when you have scattered the last crumb you must lose no time in throwing the hare to them as soon as the hare feels itself on the ground it will run away as quickly as possible and the wild beasts will turn to pursue it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iwanich thanked the old man for his counsel dismounted from his horse and taking the bag and the hare in his arms he entered the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his productions answered as nearly as i can remember to shakespeares description of a proper ballad doleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant theme sung lamentably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was scrupulously conscientious devout inclined to theological disquisitions and withal mighty in scripture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was thoroughly independent flattered nobody cared for nobody trusted nobody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when invited to sit down at our dinnertable he invariably took the precaution to place his basket of valuables between his legs for safe keeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never mind they basket jonathan said my father we shant steal thy verses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i m not sure of that returned the suspicious guest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is written trust ye not in any brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning a homeward bound ship passed us hull downthe first we had seen for months but we were nearing the land at last java head being about miles off and nearly due north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next day it was my watch on deck from eight to twelve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at breakfast the captain observed its wonder ful how that smell hangs about the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about ten the mate being on the poop i stepped down on the main deck for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the carpenters bench stood abaft the mainmast i leaned against it sucking at my pipe and the carpenter a young chap came to talk to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remarked i think we have done very well havent we <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i perceived with annoyance the fool was try ing to tilt the bench <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said curtly dont chips and immediately became aware of a queer sensation of an absurd delusioni seemed somehow to be in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard all round me like a pentup breath releasedas if a thousand giants simultaneously had said phoo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and felt a dull concussion which made my ribs ache sud denly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt about iti was in the air and my body was describing a short parabola <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but short as it was i had the time to think several thoughts in as far as i can remember the following order this cant be the carpenterwhat is it?some accidentsubmarine volcano?coals gas!by jove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a man cannot be held to write down in cold blood the wild and black thoughts that storm his brain when an uncontrolled passion has battered a breach for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet unless he sets up as a saint he need not hate himself for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is better employed as it humbly seems to me in giving thanks that power to resist was vouchsafed to him than in fretting over wicked impulses which come unsought and extort an unwilling hospitality from the weakness of our nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a fine bright morning when i walked unattended to the princesss house carrying a nosegay in my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> policy made excuses for love and every attention that i paid her while it riveted my own chains bound closer to me the people of the great city who worshipped her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found fritzs inamorata the countess helga gathering blooms in the garden for her mistresss wear and prevailed on her to take mine in their place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl was rosy with happiness for fritz in his turn had not wasted his evening and no dark shadow hung over his wooing save the hatred which the duke of strelsau was known to bear him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that she said with a mischievous smile your majesty has made of no moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i will take the flowers shall i tell you sire what is the first thing the princess does with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were talking on a broad terrace that ran along the back of the house and a window above our heads stood open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the countess merrily and flavia herself looked out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore a white gown and her hair was bring the king up helga ill give him some coffee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countess with a gay glance led the way and took me into flavias morningroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and left alone we greeted one another as lovers are wont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the princess laid two letters before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one was from black michaela most courteous request that she would honour him by spending a day at his castle of zenda as had been her custom once a year in the summer when the place and its gardens were in the height of their great beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i threw the letter down in disgust and flavia laughed at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then growing grave again she pointed to the other sheet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know who that comes from she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no signature at all this time but the handwriting was the same as that which had told me of the snare in the summerhouse it was antoinette de maubans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no cause to love you it ran but god forbid that you should fall into t
