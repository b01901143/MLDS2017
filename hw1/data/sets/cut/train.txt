<start> <start> shes as tight as a drum if you will allow me to make that comparison remarked captain weston modestly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well lets take a look around by means the searchlight and the observation windows and then well go back suggested mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will take about two days to get the stores and provisions aboard and rig up the diving suits then we will start for the sunken treasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were several powerful searchlights on the advance so arranged that the bow stern or either side could be illuminated independently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were also observation windows near each light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in turn the powerful rays were cast first at the bow and then aft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the gleams could be seen the sandy bed of the ocean covered with shells of various kinds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great crabs walked around on their long jointed legs and tom saw some lobsters that would have brought joy to the heart of a fisherman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon suddenly and he pointed to some dark shadowy forms that swam up to the glass windows evidently puzzled by the light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fish seemed suddenly to multiply and soon those in the submarine felt curious tremors running through the whole craft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fish are rubbing up against it cried tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they must think we came down here to allow them to scratch their backs on the steel plates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some time they remained on the bottom watching the wonderful sight of the fishes that swam all about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i think we may as well rise announced mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> swift after they had been on the bottom about an hour moving here and there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we didnt bring any provisions and im getting hungry though i dont know how the others of you feel about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well get enough of underwater travel once we start for the treasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to make a few notes on some needed changes and improvements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom entered the lower pilot house and turned the valve that opened the tanks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he also pulled the lever that started the pumps so that the water ballast would be more quickly emptied as that would render the submarine buoyant and she would quickly shoot to the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the surprise of the lad however there followed no outrushing of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the advance remained stationary on the ocean bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt you hear me ask you to send her up tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did dad but something seems to be the matter was the reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the aged inventor hastened to where his son and captain weston were at the wheels valves and levers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the tanks wont empty and the pumps dont seem to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no corresponding action of the machinery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats odd he remarked in a curious voice perhaps something has gone wrong with the connections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go look in the engineroom and ask mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom made a quick trip returning to report that the dynamos motors and gas engine were running perfectly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> try to work the tank levers and pumps from the conning tower suggested captain weston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes ive known the steam steering gear to play tricks like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom hurried up the circular stairway into the tower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pulled the levers and shifted the valves and wheels there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was no emptying of the water tanks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the weight and pressure of water in them still held the submarine on the bottom of the sea more than a mile from the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pumps in the engineroom were working at top speed but there was evidently something wrong in the connections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must repair it at once he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sharp will soon have it in shape again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless my soul its unlucky to have an accident on our trial trip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets see how it runs with you first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i want some sort of a load in it went on the lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wont be a good test unless i have a couple of others besides myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the old gentleman was spending a few days at the swift homestead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the experience ive been through in the airship and submarine nothing can scare me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont suppose youll hang back after that will you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont dare to for the sake of my reputation was the reply for the balloonist who had made many ascensions and dropped thousands of feet in parachutes was naturally a brave man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon climbed into the rear seats of the odd looking electric car while tom took his place at the steering wheel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless my galvanometer dont go too fast on the start cautioned mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to get it warmed up before i try any speeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a low humming purr which gradually increased to a whine and the car moved slowly forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it rolled along the gravel driveway to the road tom listening to every sound of the machinery as a mother listens to the breathing of a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not much faster than a wheelbarrow said his father who sometimes teased his son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the purring and humming increased and the car seemed to leap forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in the road now and once assured that the steering apparatus was working well tom suddenly turned on much more speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so quickly did the electric auto shoot forward that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sharp were jerked back against the cushions of the rear seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to show you a little speed answered tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the car was now moving rapidly and there was a smoothness and lightness to its progress that was absent from a gasolene auto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faster and faster it ran until it was moving at a speed scarcely less than that of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damons car when it was doing its best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course that was not saying much for the car owned by the odd gentleman was not a very powerful one but it could make fast time occasionally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that it isnt fast he hastened to add and i was wondering if it was your limit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried tom as he turned on a little more power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i just want to see how the battery and motor behaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were now moving along the highway at a good speedmoving almost silently too for the motor save for a low hum made no noise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so quiet was the car in fact that it was nearly the cause of a disaster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom was so interested in the performance of his latest invention that before he knew it he had come up behind a farmer driving a team of skittish horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the big machine went past them giving no warning of its approach the steeds reared up and would have bolted but for the prompt action of the driver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried angrily as tom speeded past dont you know you got to give warnin when youre comin with one of them ther golswizzled things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by jehossephat ill have th law on ye ef ye do thet agin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forgot to ring the bell apologized tom as he sent out a peal from the gong and then he let out a few more amperes and the speed increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the head itself was merely a bag of cloth fastened to the body at the neck and on the front of this bag was painted the faceears eyes nose and mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scarecrows face was very interesting for it bore a comical and yet winning expression although one eye was a bit larger than the other and ears were not mates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the munchkin farmer who had made the scarecrow had neglected to sew him together with close stitches and therefore some of the straw with which he was stuffed was inclined to stick out between the seams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hands consisted of padded white gloves with the fingers long and rather limp and on his feet he wore munchkin boots of blue leather with broad turns at the tops of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sawhorse was almost as curious as its rider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been rudely made in the beginning to saw logs upon so that its body was a short length of a log and its legs were stout branches fitted into four holes made in the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tail was formed by a small branch that had been left on the log while the head was a gnarled bump on one end of the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two knots of wood formed the eyes and the mouth was a gash chopped in the log <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the sawhorse first came to life it had no ears at all and so could not hear but the boy who then owned him had whittled two ears out of bark and stuck them in the head after which the sawhorse heard very distinctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this queer wooden horse was a great favorite with princess ozma who had caused the bottoms of its legs to be shod with plates of gold so the wood would not wear away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its saddle was made of clothofgold richly encrusted with precious gems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the scarecrow came in sight of the party of travelers he reined in his wooden steed and dismounted greeting the shaggy man with a smiling nod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he turned to stare at the patchwork girl in wonder while she in turn stared at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shags he whispered drawing the shaggy man aside pat me into shape theres a good fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while his friend punched and patted the scarecrows body to smooth out the humps scraps turned to ojo and whispered roll me out please ive sagged down dreadfully from walking so much and men like to see a stately figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then fell upon the ground and the boy rolled her back and forth like a rollingpin until the cotton had filled all the spaces in her patchwork covering and the body had lengthened to its fullest extent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scraps and the scarecrow both finished their hasty toilets at the same time and again they faced each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allow me miss patchwork said the shaggy man to present my friend the right royal scarecrow of oz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarecrow this is miss scraps patches scraps this is the scarecrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forgive me for staring so rudely said the scarecrow but you are the most beautiful sight my eyes have ever beheld <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a high compliment from one who is himself so beautiful murmured scraps casting down her suspenderbutton eyes by lowering her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tell me good sir are you not a trifle lumpy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes of course thats my straw you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it bunches up sometimes in spite of all my efforts to keep it even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it never bunches but its inclined to pack down and make me sag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may say it is even more stylish not to say aristocratic than straw said the scarecrow politely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still it is but proper that one so entrancingly lovely should have the best stuffing there is going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i erim so glad ive met you miss scraps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once is enough replied the shaggy man laughing at his friends enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tell me where you found her anddear me what a queer cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pure glass answered the cat proud to have attracted the scarecrows attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am much more beautiful than the patchwork girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im transparent and scraps isnt ive pink brains you can see em work and ive a ruby heart finely polished while scraps hasnt any heart at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no more have i said the scarecrow shaking hands with scraps as if to congratulate her on the fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive a friend the tin woodman who has a heart but i find i get along pretty well without one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ojo placed his hand in the flabby stuffed glove that served the scarecrow for a hand and the scarecrow pressed it so cordially that the straw in his glove crackled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime the woozy had approached the sawhorse and begun to sniff at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sawhorse resented this familiarity and with a sudden kick pounded the woozy squarely on its lead with one goldshod foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be sure he said ill take anything i have to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dont make me angry you wooden beast or my eyes will flash fire and burn you up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sawhorse rolled its knot eyes wickedly and kicked again but the woozy trotted away what a sweet disposition that creature has <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i advise you to chop it up for kindlingwood and use me to ride upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my back is flat and you cant fall off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think the trouble is that you havent been properly introduced said the scarecrow regarding the woozy with much wonder for he had never seen such a queer animal before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sawhorse is the favorite steed of princess ozma the ruler of the land of oz and he lives in a stable decorated with pearls and emeralds at the rear of the royal palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is swift as the wind untiring and is kind to his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the people of oz respect the sawhorse highly and when i visit ozma she sometimes allows me to ride himas i am doing today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you know what an important personage the sawhorse is and if some oneperhaps yourselfwill tell me your name your rank and station and your history it will give me pleasure to relate them to the sawhorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this will lead to mutual respect and friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quox as you well know is a young dragon who has not yet acquired the wisdom of his race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because of this lack he has been disrespectful toward his most ancient ancestor the original dragon telling him once to mind his own business and again saying that the ancient one had grown foolish with age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are aware that dragons are not the same as fairies and cannot be altogether guided by our laws yet such disrespect as quox has shown should not be unnoticed by us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore i have selected quox as my royal instrument of vengeance and he shall go through the tube with these people and inflict upon ruggedo the punishment i have decreed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all had listened quietly to this speech and now the kings and queens bowed gravely to signify their approval of the jinjins judgment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i command you said he to escort these strangers to the tube and see that they all enter it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of the tube who had first discovered our friends and brought them to the private citizen stepped forward and bowed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he did so the jinjin and all the kings and queens suddenly disappeared and only tubekins remained visible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all right said betsy with a sigh i dont mind going back so very much cause the jinjin promised to make it easy for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed queen ann and her officers were the only ones who looked solemn and seemed to fear the return journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing that bothered ann was her failure to conquer this land of tititi hoochoo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they followed their guide through the gardens to the mouth of the tube she said to how can i conquer the world if i go away and leave this rich country unconquered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont ask me why please for if you dont know i cant inform you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said ann but shaggy paid no attention to the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this end of the tube had a silver rim and around it was a gold railing to which was attached a sign that read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a little silver plate just inside the tube burrowed and built by hiergargo the magician in the year of the world for his own exclusive uses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was some builder i must say remarked betsy when she had read the inscription but if he had known about that star i guess hed have spent his time playing solitaire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked ann who had never seen a live dragon and was a little fearful of meeting one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no indeed replied the king of the tube <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll see him in a minute but before you part company im sure youll wish he was invisible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but quox tires me dreadfully said tubekins and i prefer his room to his company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that instant a scraping sound was heard drawing nearer and nearer until from between two big bushes appeared a huge dragon who approached the party nodded his head and said good morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had quox been at all bashful i am sure he would have felt uncomfortable at the astonished stare of every eye in the groupexcept tubekins of course who was not astonished because he had seen quox so often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> betsy had thought a young dragon must be a small dragon yet here was one so enormous that the girl decided he must be full grown if not overgrown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his body was a lovely skyblue in color and it was thickly set with glittering silver scales each one as big as a servingtray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around his neck was a pink ribbon with a bow just under his left ear and below the ribbon appeared a chain of pearls to which was attached a golden locket about as large around as the end of a bass drum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this locket was set with many large and beautiful jewels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the head and face of quox were not especially ugly when you consider that he was a dragon but his eyes were so large that it took him a long time to wink and his teeth seemed very sharp and terrible when they showed which they did whenever the beast smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also his nostrils were quite large and wide and those who stood near him were liable to smell brimstoneespecially when he breathed out fire as it is the nature of dragons to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the end of his long tail was attached a big electric light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps the most singular thing about the dragons appearance at this time was the fact that he had a row of seats attached to his back one seat for each member of the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these seats were double with curved backs so that two could sit in them and there were twelve of these double seats all strapped firmly around the dragons thick body and placed one behind the other in a row that extended from his shoulders nearly to his tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered more and more at his own neglect in not before having asked the balloonist when the latter was in shopton where andy was building his aeroplane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while waiting for a reply to his letter tom busied himself about his own craft making several changes he had decided on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he also began to paint and decorate it for he wanted to have the hummingbird present a neat appearance when she was officially entered in the great race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss nestor called on tom again and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he agreed to accompany tom to the aviation park when it was time for the race and also to be a passenger in the tenthousanddollar contest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be perfectly wonderful to fly through the air said miss nestor one day when tom and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon had the hummingbird out on the testing ground trying the engine which had been keyed up to a higher pitch of speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i consider it perfectly marvelous and i cant imagine how it must seem to skim along that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that machine is too swift by name and swift by nature for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont you take miss nestor on a grasscutting flight tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it means skimming along a few feet up in the air answered the young inventor who had now fully recovered from the effects of the blow given him by the midnight intruder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of many inquiries no clues to his identity had been obtained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how high do you go when you cut grass as you call it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked miss nestor and tom thought he detected a note of eager curiosity in her voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact sometimes i do cut off the tops of tall daisies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know youll like it and when youve been over the lawn a few times youll be ready for a high flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ii almost believe i will she said hesitatingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you take me down when i want to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hummingbird was all ready for a trial flight and tom was glad of the chance to test it especially with such a pretty passenger as was miss nestor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can see where i am going to be cut out tom swift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill not get many more rides with you now that miss nestor is taking to aeroplaning you young rascal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he playfully shook his finger at tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i dont expect to get enthusiastic over it said miss nestor who now that she had taken her place in one of the small seats under the engine appeared as if she would be glad of the chance to change her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if you take me more than five feet up in the air ill never speak to you again tom swift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five feet it shall be unless you yourself ask to go higher was the youths reply as he winked at mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he knew the fascination of aeroplaning and he was almost sure of what would happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can take a tape measure along and see for yourself he added to his fair passenger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the barograph will hardly register such a little height <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its as high as i want to go said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a scream as tom started the propeller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the motor was speeded up until it sounded like the roar of the ocean surf in a storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gave her a slight shove to overcome the inertia and the trim little craft darted across the ground at every increasing speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss nestor caught her breath with a gasp glanced at tom and noted how cool he was and then her frantic grip of the uprights slightly relaxed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well go up a little way in a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shouted tom in her ear as they were speeding over the level ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is said the great gulf has no bottom but however that may be king kynd has never been seen again and my father became king in his place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seems to me said trot that if gloria had her rights she would be queen of jinxland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well her father was a king admitted pon and so was my father so we are of equal rank although shes a great lady and im a humble gardeners boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant see why we should not marry if we want to except that king krewl wont let us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a sort of mixedup mess taken altogether remarked capn bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we are on our way to visit king krewl and if we get a chance young man well put in a good word for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it the flogging you got that broke your heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why it helped to break it of course said pon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id get it fixed up if i were you advised the boy tossing a pebble at a chipmunk in a tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ought to give gloria just as good a heart as she gives you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they left the gardeners boy standing beside the path and resumed their journey toward the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when our friends approached the great doorway of the castle they found it guarded by several soldiers dressed in splendid uniforms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were armed with swords and does the king happen to be at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his magnificent and glorious majesty king krewl is at present inhabiting his royal castle was the stiff reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i guess well go in an say howdyedo continued capn bill attempting to enter the doorway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a soldier barred his way with a lance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who are you what are your names and where do you come from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wouldnt know if we told you returned the sailor seein as were strangers in a strange land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh if you are strangers you will be permitted to enter said the soldier lowering his lance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are the first that ever came to our country said the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his majesty has often said that if strangers ever arrived in jinxland he would see that they had a very exciting time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wasnt very favorably impressed by this last remark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he decided that as there was no way of escape from jinxland it would be wise to confront the king boldly and try to win his favor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they entered the castle escorted by one of the soldiers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was certainly a fine castle with many large rooms all beautifully furnished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passages were winding and handsomely decorated and after following several of these the soldier led them into an open court that occupied the very center of the huge building <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was surrounded on every side by high turreted walls and contained beds of flowers fountains and walks of many colored marbles which were matched together in quaint designs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an open space near the middle of the court they saw a group of courtiers and their ladies who surrounded a lean man who wore upon his head a jeweled crown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was hard and sullen and through the slits of his halfclosed eyelids the eyes glowed like coals of fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was dressed in brilliant satins and velvets and was seated in a golden thronechair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this personage was king krewl and as soon as capn bill saw him the old sailor knew at once that he was not going to like the king of jinxland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strangers sire answered the soldier bowing so low that his forehead touched the marble tiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> advance strangers and give an account of yourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kings voice was as harsh as his features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trot there aint much for us to say cept as weve arrived to look over your country an see how we like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judgin from the way you speak you dont know who we are or youd be jumpin up to shake hands an offer us seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kings usually treat us pretty well in the great big outside world where we come from but in this little kingdom which dont amount to much anyhow folks dont seem to a got much culchure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> skipping over much of what happened on the way back ill tell you how the thing wound up in bildad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we got the prisoner in the sheriffs office i says to you remember that kid of yoursthat twoyearold that they luke looks black and angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hed never let anybody talk to him about that business and he never mentioned it himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you remember when he was toddling around on the porch and fell down on a pair of mexican spurs and cut four little holes over his right eye <end> <end>

<start> <start> editors note the wild animals of africa have been hunted with firearms for many a year and photographed by more than one marksman of the lens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here is the truly unique expedition into the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea that any one should seriously contemplate a journey to africa for the purpose of lassoing such creatures as sportsmen either shoot or photograph at the longest range possible seems quite absurd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but an american frontiersman has done it with american cowboys cowponies and huntingdogs and with wonderful moving pictures to prove it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a fine evidence of the sporting qualities of both parties to the undertaking that colonel c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jones a western plainsman could so completely interest mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bird an eastern manufacturer in the fantastic plan as to command his backing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if there is such a thing as the glow of adventure by proxy it must have been felt in the nassau street law office where the buffalo jones african expedition had its headquarters when the cablegram from nairobi announced that lion and rhino had been lassoed and that the moving pictures were a complete success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a special trainloaded to capacity with horses and dogs camp baggage movingpicture cameras cowboys photographers and porters and when it pulled out of the nairobi station on the way to the up country of british east africa the period of preparation passed away and the time of action began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the faces of the people on the platform glided by the window of the slowly moving carriage there was good will written on all of them but also unbelief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no doubt as to what they thought of buffalo joness expedition that was setting out to rope and tie and photograph the wild animals of the east african veldt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how are you going to hold a rhino that weighs two tons and a half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are you going to do when the lion charges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such were the questions asked us by the hunters of the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they further took pains to explain that a rhino charges like a flash and that a lion can catch a horse within a hundred yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these items of information however were well known to buffalo jones before the expedition was organized in new york and his preparations to meet the difficulties had been made accordingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jones is tall and spare with a strong rugged face and keen blue eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during his sixtyfive years of life he has roped and tied often singlehanded every kind of wild animal of consequence to be found in our western country and his experience with these has led him to believe implicitly that man is the master of all wild beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has climbed trees after mountain lions and with a lasso over a branch has hauled grizzlies up into the air by one hind leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and once he set out alone to journey over a country that no white man had ever traveled before to reach the land of the muskox on the border of the arctic circle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the story is told of how he met a trapper on the way and how these two in the face of the hostility of all the indian tribes the wolves and the cold of the northern winter eventually came to the muskox and captured five calves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then deserted by their indian guide they started to return with their prizes got lost in the wilderness and fought the wolves till their cartridges ran out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when at last they reached safety and fell asleep exhausted the indians obeying the laws of their religion stole upon them in the night and killed the calves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the success he had achieved with the mountain lions of the southwest the muskox of the north and the grizzly bears of the rockies was not enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for twenty years it had been the one ambition of his life to take an outfit to british east africa to try his hand with the more ferocious big game of that country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in his western experience colonel jones had learned something else besides the mastery of man over beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> precisely how an american cowboy was going to hold a rhinoceros that weighed two tons and a half was purely a matter of speculation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet of one thing the colonel was certainthe experiment would result in a moving picture that would be well worth the taking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this reason what afterward came to be known as the picture department was added to the makeup of the expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the preparations extended over a considerable length of time and were carried on in various places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unquestionably the most important part of the outfit was the horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was absolutely essential that they should be western cowponies fast well trained and reliable in every way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the colonel who best of all could foresee the nature of the work they would have to do selected them himself ten in all from the ranches of new mexico and shipped them to new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the american dogs to be used for trailing were likewise chosen by the colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of them belonged to him personally and had been thoroughly tried out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the two cowboys who were to act as his assistants marshall loveless had worked with the colonel before and knew his methods and ambrose means came highly recommended for skill and daring from one of the largest ranch owners in the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when at the last moment the writer of these articles was introduced to the expedition in the capacity of acting field manager the preparations were well under way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the horses and dogs had been already shipped en route to africa in charge of the cowboys and the date of our sailing for london had been fixed for the following day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the meeting was held at a luncheon in the railroad club in new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sewall of the boma trading company of nairobi and myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after certain matters of business had been disposed of the talk at the luncheon table drifted to the probabilities and possibilities of success to lions rhinos elands and cheetahs to cowboys horses and dogs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the colonel would hear of no possibilities or even probabilities of failure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the hour of the business mans lunch time came to an end and the room began to empty mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sewall said of course every one in nairobi will think all of you either fakers or crazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know whether youre crazy or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there is one thing in your favor the colonels unshaken belief that the thing can be done will probably pull it through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear scull it has been asked by some what the object of the buffalo jones african expedition was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jones broke his rifle a generation or so ago and vowed he would never again kill game save for food or in selfdefense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since taking that oath he has subdued and captured all kinds of wild animals in north america including the muskox buffalo grizzly bear and cougar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i discovered that it was his dream to go to east africa to prove that with american cowboys horses and dogs he could lasso and capture the savage animals of that country as readily as he has the wild animals of our country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a sporting proposition it seemed to me unique and fascinating and so as a small tribute to colonel jones i volunteered to finance the expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i somewhat doubt whether there is another man in the world who has the courage skill and determination to do what he has done in the animal kingdom and he well deserves to be called the preserver of the american bison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to acknowledge our indebtedness to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fowler of new york for his assistance in helping us outfit the expedition in london and nairobi and to you and the others who have helped to make the expedition a success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on our arrival in london about the middle of january of this year the work of preparation was continued at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> outside of the minor details of the outfit such as personal equipment saddlery medicines bandages and so forth the first matter to receive attention was the organization of the picture department <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cherry kearton was sought to take charge of this branch of the expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keartona powerfully built yorkshiremanis an experienced cinematograph photographer and a naturalist of no small reputation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well mused the queen there is surely some way to conquer that slight boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are afraid to undertake the job i shall go myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by some stratagem i shall manage to make him my prisoner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will not dare to defy a queen and no magic can stand against a womans cunning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go ahead if you like replied the king with an evil grin and if you are hung up by the thumbs or cast into a dungeon it will serve you right for thinking you can succeed where a skilled warrior dares not make the attempt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is only soldiers and bullies who are cowards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of this assertion queen cor was not so brave as she was cunning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for several days she thought over this plan and that and tried to decide which was most likely to succeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had never seen the boy prince but had heard so many tales of him from the defeated warriors and especially from captain buzzub that she had learned to respect his power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> spurred on by the knowledge that she would never get rid of her unwelcome guests until prince inga was overcome and regos regained for king gos the queen of coregos finally decided to trust to luck and her native wit to defeat a simpleminded boy however powerful he might be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inga could not suspect what she was going to do because she did not know herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she intended to act boldly and trust to chance to win <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is evident that had the cunning queen known that inga had lost all his magic she would not have devoted so much time to the simple matter of capturing him but like all others she was impressed by the marvelous exhibition of power he had shown in capturing regos and had no reason to believe the boy was less powerful now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one morning queen cor boldly entered a boat and taking four men with her as an escort and bodyguard was rowed across the narrow channel to regos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prince inga was sitting in the palace playing checkers with king rinkitink when a servant came to him saying that queen cor had arrived and desired an audience with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with many misgivings lest the wicked queen discover that he had now lost his magic powers the boy ordered her to be admitted and she soon entered the room and bowed low before him in mock respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cor was a big woman almost as tall as king gos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had flashing black eyes and the dark complexion you see on gypsies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her temper when irritated was something dreadful and her face wore an evil expression which she tried to cover by smiling sweetly often when she meant the most mischief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have come said she in a low voice to render homage to the noble prince of pingaree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am told that your highness is the strongest person in the world and invincible in battle and therefore i wish you to become my friend rather than my enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now inga did not know how to reply to this speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he disliked the appearance of the woman and was afraid of her and he was unused to deception and did not know how to mask his real feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he took time to think i have no quarrel with your majesty and my only reason for coming here is to liberate my father and mother and my people whom you and your husband have made your slaves and to recover the goods king gos has plundered from the island of pingaree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i hope soon to accomplish and if you really wish to be my friend you can assist me greatly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he was speaking queen cor had been studying the boys face stealthily from the corners of her eyes and she said to herself he is so small and innocent that i believe i can capture him alone and with ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he does not seem very terrible and i suspect that king gos and his warriors were frightened at nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish to invite you mighty prince and your friend the great king of gilgad to visit my poor palace at coregos where all my people shall do you honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at present replied inga uneasily i must refuse your kind invitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there will be feasting and dancing girls and games and fireworks said the queen speaking as if eager to entice him and at each word coming a step nearer to where he stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not enjoy them while my poor parents are slaves said the boy sadly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked queen cor and by that time she was close beside inga <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly she leaned forward and threw both of her long arms around ingas body holding him in a grasp that was like a vise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now rinkitink sprang forward to rescue his friend but cor kicked out viciously with her foot and struck the king squarely on his stomach a very tender place to be kicked especially if one is fat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly the four men she had brought with her sprang into the room and bound the boy hand and foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next they seized rinkitink who was still rubbing his stomach and bound him likewise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a laugh of wicked triumph queen cor now led her captives down to the boat and returned with them to coregos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sawhorse and i made a journey in the dark while you were all asleep and we found over there a bigger city than thi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a wall around it too but it has gates and plenty of pathways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no for the gates were locked and the wall was a real wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can reach it in two hours after youve had your breakfasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trot went back and finding the other girls now awake told them what scraps had said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they hurriedly ate some fruit there were plenty of plums and fijoas in this part of the orchard and then they mounted the animals and set out upon the journey to the strange city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hank the mule had breakfasted on grass and the lion had stolen away and found a breakfast to his liking he never told what it was but dorothy hoped the little rabbits and the field mice had kept out of his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she warned toto not to chase birds and gave the dog some apple with which he was quite content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the woozy was as fond of fruit as of any other food except honey and the sawhorse never ate at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> except for their worry over ozma they were all in good spirits as they proceeded swiftly over the plain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toto still worried over his lost growl but like a wise little dog kept his worry to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before long the city grew nearer and they could examine it with interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in outward appearance the place was more imposing than thi and it was a square city with a square foursided wall around it and on each side was a square gate of burnished copper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything about the city looked solid and substantial there were no banners flying and the towers that rose above the city wall seemed bare of any ornament whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a path led from the fruit orchard directly to one of the city gates showing that the inhabitants preferred fruit to thistles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our friends followed this path to the gate which they found fast shut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the wizard advanced and pounded upon it with his fist saying in a loud voice open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once there rose above the great wall a row of immense heads all of which looked down of these heads was astonishing and our friends at once realized that they belonged to giants who were standing within the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all had thick bushy hair and whiskers on some the hair being white and on others black or red or yellow while the hair of a few was just turning gray showing that the giants were of all ages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however fierce the heads might seem the eyes were mild in expression as if the creatures had been long subdued and their faces expressed patience rather than ferocity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked one old giant in a low grumbling voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are strangers and we wish to enter the city replied the wizard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in peace of course retorted the wizard and he added impatiently do we look like an army of conquest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said the first giant who had spoken you look like innocent tramps but one never can tell by appearances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait here until we report to our masters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one can enter here without the permission of vig the czarover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the heads had all bobbed down and disappeared behind the wall so there was no answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they waited a long time before the gate rolled back with a rumbling sound and a loud voice cried enter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they lost no time in taking advantage of the invitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on either side of the broad street that led into the city from the gate stood a row of huge giants twenty of them on a side and all standing so close together that their elbows touched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wore uniforms of blue and yellow and were armed with clubs as big around as treetrunks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each giant had around his neck a broad band of gold riveted on to show he was a slave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as our friends entered riding upon the lion the woozy the sawhorse and the mule the giants half turned and walked in two files on either side of them as if escorting them on their way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looked to dorothy as if all her party had been made prisoners for even mounted on their animals their heads scarcely reached to the knees of the marching giants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls and buttonbright were anxious to know what sort of a city they had entered and what the people were like who had made these powerful creatures their slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the legs of the giants as they walked dorothy could see rows of houses on each side the street and throngs of people standing on the sidewalks but the people were of ordinary size and the only remarkable thing about them was the fact that they were dreadfully lean and thin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between their skin and their bones there seemed to be little or no flesh and they were mostly stoop shouldered and weary looking even to the little children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more and more dorothy wondered how and why the great giants had ever submitted to be come slaves of such skinny languid masters but there was no chance to question anyone until they arrived at a big palace located in the heart of the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the giants formed lines to the entrance and stood still while our friends rode into the courtyard of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted to get high enough so that if they passed over a city they would not be observed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at noon it could be seen through the glass that they were over the outskirts of some large place and after the the environs of paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we wont if the wind holds out remarked tom and this good fortune came to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they succeeded in landing in a field not far from a small village and though several farmers wondered much as the sight of the big airship it was thought by the platinumseekers that they would be comparatively safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now to get the first train for paris and get the things i need exclaimed tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he set to work taking off the broken pieces that they might be duplicated and then having inquired at an inn for the nearest railroad station and having hired a rig the young inventor set off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess i can parley enough to get along with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a small knowledge of the tongue and with that and knowing that english was spoken in many places he felt that he could make out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he easily found his way about the gay capital and located a machine shop where a specialty was made of parts for automobile and airship motors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the proprietor knowing the broken pieces belonged to an aeroplane questioned tom about his craft but the young inventor knew better than to give any clew that might make trouble so he returned evasive answers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was nearly night when he got back to the place where he had left the falcon and he found a curious crowd of rustics grouped about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no everything is quiet im glad to say replied mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think our presence will create stir enough so that the news of it will reach the spies in paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still i will feel easier when were in the air again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will take a day to make the repairs said tom and put in the new pieces of platinum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ill work as fast as i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and ned labored far into the night and were at it again the next morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon and the russian were of no service for they did not understand the machinery well enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was while tom was outside the craft filing a piece of platinum in an improvised vise that a poorly clothed man sauntered up and watched him curiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom glanced at him and was at once struck by a difference between the mans attire and his person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for though he was tattered and torn the mans face showed a certain refinement and his hands were not those of a farmer or laborer in which character he obviously posed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur has a fine airship there he remarked to tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man spoke english but with an accent and certain peculiarities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had hurt his finger with the file and he was not in the best of humor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah does monsieur mean that i have poor eyesight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the question was snapped out so suddenly and with such a menacing tone that tom glanced up quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was surprised at the look in the mans eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as you choose to take it was the cool answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know anything about your eyes but i know ive got work to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to be too short with you but ive really got to get this done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one side if you please and having finished what he was doing he started toward the airship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yoop transformed me she didnt realize i should have more stuffing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired jinjur pausing with the broom still upraised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are really the famous scarecrow of oz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just now im as you see me a miserable little brown bear with a poor quality of stuffing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that tin owl is none other than our dear tin woodman nick chopper the emperor of the winkies while this green monkey is a nice little boy we recently became acquainted with woot the wanderer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i said the canary flying close to jinjur am polychrome the daughter of the rainbow in the form of a bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried jinjur amazed that giantess must be a powerful sorceress and as wicked as she is powerful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately we managed to escape from her castle and we are now on our way to glinda the good to see if she possesses the power to restore us to our former shapes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i must beg your pardons all of you must forgive me said jinjur putting away the broom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took you to be a lot of wild unmannerly animals as was quite natural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are very welcome to my home and im sorry i havent the power to help you out of your troubles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please use my house and all that i have as if it were your own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this declaration of peace the bear got upon his feet and the owl resumed his perch upon the chair and the monkey crept out of the fireplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a green monkey said she youre the blackest creature i ever saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youll get my nice clean room all dirty with soot and ashes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever possessed you to jump up the chimney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i i was scared explained woot somewhat ashamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you need renovating and thats what will happen to you right away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now neither boys nor monkeys relish being scrubbed so woot shrank away from the energetic girl trembling fearfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but jinjur grabbed him by his paw and dragged him out to the back yard where in spite of his whines and struggles she plunged him into a tub of cold water and began to scrub him with a stiff brush and a cake of yellow soap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the hardest trial that woot had endured since he became a monkey but no protest had any influence with jinjur who lathered and scrubbed him in a businesslike manner and afterward dried him with a coarse towel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bear and the owl gravely watched this operation and nodded approval when woots silky green fur shone clear and bright in the afternoon sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the canary seemed much amused and laughed a silvery ripple of very well done my good jinjur i admire your energy and judgment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i had no idea a monkey could look so comical as this monkey did while he was being bathed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> declared woot resentfully im just a boy in a monkeys shape thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you can explain to me the difference said jinjur ill agree not to wash you again that is unless you foolishly get into the fireplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all persons are usually judged by the shapes in which they appear to the eyes of others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre as pretty a girl as ive ever seen he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come out into the garden with me she said and ill give you some of the most delicious caramels you ever ate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre a new variety that no one can grow but me and they have a heliotrope flavor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in her magnificent palace in the emerald city the beautiful girl ruler of all the wonderful land of oz sat in her dainty boudoir with her friend princess dorothy beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be as hard for us to capture the three fishes from among all the other fishes in the lake as to capture the swan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if we could it would be more help to us persisted the little girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is true answered ozma smiling at her friends eagerness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you find a way to catch the fish and ill promise when they are caught to restore them to their proper forms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you think i cant do it replied dorothy but im going to try <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she left the palace and went to a place where she could look through a clear pane of the glass dome into the surrounding water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately she became interested in the queer sights that met her view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lake of the skeezers was inhabited by fishes of many kinds and many sizes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water was so transparent that the girl could see for a long distance and the fishes came so close to the glass of the dome that sometimes they actually touched it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the white sands at the bottom of the lake were starfish lobsters crabs and many shell fish of strange shapes and with shells of gorgeous hues <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water foliage was of brilliant colors and to dorothy it resembled a splendid garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the fishes were the most interesting of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some were big and lazy floating slowly along or lying at rest with just their fins waving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many with big round eyes looked full at the girl as she watched them and dorothy wondered if they could hear her through the glass if she spoke to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in oz where all the animals and birds can talk many fishes are able to talk also but usually they are more stupid than birds and animals because they think slowly and havent much to talk about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the lake of the skeezers the fish of smaller size were more active than the big ones and darted quickly in and out among the swaying weeds as if they had important business and were in a hurry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was among the smaller varieties that dorothy hoped to spy the gold and silver and bronze fishes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had an idea the three would keep together being companions now as they were in their natural forms but such a multitude of fishes constantly passed the scene shifting every moment that she was not sure she would notice them even if they appeared in view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes couldnt look in all directions and the fishes she sought might be on the other side of the dome or far away in the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> praps because they were afraid of cooeeoh theyve hid themselves somewhere and dont know their enemy has been transformed she reflected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she watched the fishes for a long time until she became hungry and went back to the palace for lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there isnt anything better for me to do ozma so i guess ill go back and watch again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glinda the good in her palace in the quadling country had many things to occupy her mind for not only did she look after the weaving and embroidery of her bevy of maids and assist all those who came to her to implore her help beasts and birds as well as people but she was a close student of the arts of sorcery and spent much time in her magical laboratory where she strove to find a remedy for every evil and to perfect her skill in magic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless she did not forget to look in the great book of records each day to see if any mention was made of the visit of ozma and dorothy to the enchanted mountain of the flatheads and the magic isle of the skeezers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the records told her that ozma had arrived at the mountain that she had escaped with her companion and gone to the island of the skeezers and that queen cooeeoh had submerged the island so that it was entirely under water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came the statement that the flatheads had come to the lake to poison the fishes and that their supreme dictator had transformed queen coo eeoh into a swan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no other details were given in the great book and so glinda did not know that since cooeeoh had forgotten her magic none of the skeezers knew how to raise the island to the surface again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as tom rode nearer the cliff he could make out around it groups of rude buildings covered with corrugated iron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then in the face of the cliff there showed something blacklike a blot of ink though more regular in outline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on over to the office and ill introduce you to my brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess he will be glad weve arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom dismounted from his mule an example followed by the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper gazed up at the great mountains and i wonder if the lost city of pelone lies among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly the silence of the evening was broken by a dull rumbling sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i never knew them to set off one so late before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as he spoke panicstricken men began running out of the mouth of the tunnel while those outside hastened toward them shouting and calling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> titus as he ran forward followed by tom mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper started with them but on the way he saw a curious bit of rock which he stopped to pick up and examine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the entrance of the tunnel from which came rushing dirtstained and powderblackened men mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> titus was met by a man who seemed to be in authority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must see to the poor fellows who are hurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess there arent many his brother said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were on their way out when the charge went off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some more of blakeson grinders work ill wager <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were rushing in to the smokefilled tunnel now followed by tom mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon and koku who would follow his young master anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom saw that the tunnel was lighted with incandescent lamps suspended here and there from the rocky roof or sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the electric lights were supplied with current from a dynamo run by a gasoline engine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked walter titus of a tall indian who seemed to be in some authority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> back at second turn was the answer in fairly good english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ran on into the tunnel tom and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon noticing that a small narrowgage railroad was laid on the floor mules being the motive power to bring out the small dump cars loaded with rock and dirt excavated from the big hole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called job titus who was ahead of tom and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom found it so for he slipped over some pieces of rock and would have fallen had not koku held him up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little later he came to a place where a cluster of electric lights gave better illumination and he could see it was there that the damage had been done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a number of men were lying on the dirt and rock floor of the tunnel and some of them were bleeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> others were staggering about as though shocked or stunned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must get the injured ones out of here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> broke in a voice rich in irish brogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but hes thot stupid he might think i was after sindin him fer wather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> serato is after the stretchers all right said walter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats tim sullivan our irish foreman though he has only a few of his own kind to boss explained job titus in a whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as to the godhead he cannot give it to you neither fulfil his speech to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he was bitter against you and your descendants that will come after you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this time the garments that the lord had given them in genesis were burned off so that adam and eve were again naked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reference chapter l whereby adam and eve seek garments with which to cover their nakedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then adam and eve came into the cave yet trembling at look the fire has burnt our flesh in this world but how will it be when we are dead and satan shall punish our souls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is not our deliverance long and far off unless god come and in mercy to us fulfil his promise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then adam and eve passed into the cave blessing themselves for coming into it once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it was in their thoughts that they never should enter it when they saw the fire around it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as the sun was setting the fire was still burning and nearing adam and eve in the cave so that they could not sleep in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the sun had set they went out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the fortyseventh day after they came out of the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adam and eve then came under the top of hill by the garden to sleep as they were accustomed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they stood and prayed god to forgive them their sins and then fell asleep under the summit of the mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but satan the hater of all good thought within himself whereas god has promised salvation to adam by covenant and that he would deliver him out of all the hardships that have befallen him but has not promised me by covenant and will not deliver me out of my hardships no since he has promised him that he should make him and his descendants live in the kingdom in which i once was i will kill adam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earth shall be rid of him and shall be left to me alone so that when he is dead he may not have any descendants left to inherit the kingdom that shall remain my own realm god will then be wanting me and he will restore it to me and my hosts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xlviii fifth apparition of satan to adam and eve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after this satan called to his hosts all of which o our lord what will you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then said to them you know that this adam whom god created out of the dust is the one who has taken our kingdom come let us gather together and kill him or hurl a rock at him and at eve and crush them under it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when satans hosts heard these words they came to the part of the mountain where adam and eve were asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then satan and his host took a huge rock broad and even and without blemish thinking within himself if there should be a hole in the rock when it fell on them the hole in the rock might come over them and so they would escape and not die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> him will i deliver though he sail even to hades to free ixion below from his brazen chains as far as strength lies in my limbs so that pelias may not mock at having escaped an evil doompelias who left me unhonoured with sacrifice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover jason was greatly loved by me before ever since at the mouth of anaurus in flood as i was making trial of mens righteousness he met me on his return from the chase and all the mountains and long ridged peaks were sprinkled with snow and from them the torrents rolling down were rushing with a roar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he took pity on me in the likeness of an old crone and raising me on his shoulders himself bore me through the headlong tide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he is honoured by me unceasingly nor will pelias pay the penalty of his outrage unless thou wilt grant jason his return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beholding hera supplicating her she felt awe and then addressed her with friendly words dread goddess may no viler thing than cypris ever be found if i disregard thy eager desire in word or deed whatever my weak arms can effect and let there be no favour in return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spake and hera again addressed her with prudence it is not in need of might or of strength that we have come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but just quietly bid thy boy charm aeetes daughter with love for jason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if she will aid him with her kindly counsel easily do i think he will win the fleece of gold and return to iolcus for she is full of wiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus she spake and cypris addressed them both hera and athena he will obey you rather than me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for unabashed though he is there will be some slight shame in his eyes before you but he has no respect for me but ever slights me in contentious mood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and overborne by his naughtiness i purpose to break his illsounding arrows and his bow in his very sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for in his anger he has threatened that if i shall not keep my hands off him while he still masters his temper i shall have cause to blame myself thereafter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she spake and the goddesses smiled and looked at each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but cypris again spoke vexed at heart to others my sorrows are a jest nor ought i to tell them to all i know them too well myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now since this pleases you both i will make the attempt and coax him and he will not say me nay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus she spake and hera took her slender hand and gently smiling replied perform this task cytherea straightway as thou sayest and be not angry or contend with thy boy he will cease hereafter to vex thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spake and left her seat and athena accompanied her and they went forth both hastening back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and cypris went on her way through the glens of olympus to find her boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she found him apart in the blooming orchard of zeus not alone but with him ganymedes whom once zeus had set to dwell among the immortal gods being enamoured of his beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they were playing for golden dice as boys in one house are wont to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and already greedy eros was holding the palm of his left hand quite full of them under his breast standing upright and on the bloom of his cheeks a sweet blush was glowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the other sat crouching hard by silent and downcast and he had two dice left which he threw one after the other and was angered by the loud laughter of eros <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and lo losing them straightway with the former he went off empty handed helpless and noticed not the approach of cypris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she stood before her boy and ll <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dost thou smile in triumph unutterable rogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hast thou cheated him thus and unjustly overcome the innocent child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come be ready to perform for me the task i will tell thee of and i will give thee zeus allbeauteous plaything the one which his dear nurse adrasteia made for him while he still lived a child with childish ways in the idaean cavea wellrounded ball no better toy wilt thou get from the hands of hephaestus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all of gold are its zones and round each double seams run in a circle but the stitches are hidden and a dark blue spiral overlays them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if thou shouldst cast it with thy hands lo like a star it sends a flaming track through the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i will give thee and do thou strike with thy shaft and charm the daughter of aeetes with love for jason and let there be no loitering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for then my thanks would be the slighter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus she spake and welcome were her words to the listening boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he threw down all his toys and eagerly seizing her robe on this side and on that clung to the goddess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he implored her to bestow the gift at once but she facing him with kindly words touched his cheeks kissed him and drew ll <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be witness now thy dear head and mine that surely i will give thee the gift and deceive thee not if thou wilt strike with thy shaft aeetes daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spoke and he gathered up his dice and having well counted them all threw them into his mothers gleaming lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and straightway with golden baldric he slung round him his quiver from where it leant against a treetrunk and took up his curved bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he fared forth through the fruitful orchard of the palace of zeus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he passed through the gates of olympus high in air hence is a downward path from heaven and the twin poles rear aloft steep mountain tops the highest crests of earth where the risen sun grows ruddy with his first beams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beneath him there appeared now the lifegiving earth and cities of men and sacred streams of rivers and now in turn mountain peaks and the ocean all around as he swept through the vast expanse of air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the heroes apart in ambush in a backwater of the river were met in council sitting on the benches of their ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could observe in their countenances and gestures the greatest expressions of joy when they exceeded me and when the reverse happened of envy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shawanese king took great notice of me and treated me with profound respect and entire friendship often entrusting me to hunt at my liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i frequently returned with the spoils of the woods and as often presented some of what i had taken to him expressive of duty to my sovereign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my food and lodging was in common with them not so good indeed as i could desire but necessity made every thing acceptable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i now began to meditate an escape and carefully avoided their suspicions continuing with them at old chelicothe until the first day of june following and then was taken by them to the salt springs on sciotha and kept there making salt ten days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had heard of her coming though at the time the conversation had interested him not at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had learned the name and history of every eligible young man in the district two days after her arrival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was due partly to her own bold curiosity and partly to the fact that she was boarding with the widow becker the most notorious gossip in the county <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in bellas mental list of the neighborhood swains ben westerveld he felt his face redden as they approached each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to hide his embarrassment he swung his little hickory switch gaily and called to his dog dunder who was nosing about by the roadside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dunder bounded forward spied the newcomer and leaped toward her bella screamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she screamed and ran to ben and clung to him clasping her hands about his arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben lifted the hickory switch in his free hand and struck dunder a sharp cut with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time in his life that he had done such a thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had had a sane moment from that time until the day he married bella huckins he never would have forgotten the dumb hurt in bella screamed again still clinging to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wont hurt you meanwhile patting her shoulder reassuringly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was so slight so childlike so apparently different from the sturdy country girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her helplessness her utter femininity appealed to all that was masculine in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bella the experienced clinging to him felt herself swept from head to foot by a queer electric tingling that was very pleasant but that still had in it something of the sensation of a wholesale bumping of ones crazy bone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she had been anything but a stupid little flirt she would have realized that here was a specimen of the virile male with which she could not trifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she glanced up at him now smiling faintly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my i but bella looked over her shoulder fearfully to where dunder stood by the roadside regarding ben with a look of uncertainty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still thought that perhaps this was a new game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a game that he cared for but still one to be played if his master fancied it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben stooped picked up a stone and threw it at go on home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he started toward the dog with a wellfeigned gesture of menace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dunder with a low howl put his tail between his legs and loped off bella stood looking up at ben <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess you must think im a fool going on like a baby most girls would be scared of him if they didnt know he pleased to meet you said bella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a dog down at tietjens thats enough to scare anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forgot something at the school this afternoon and i was walking over to get it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope it wont get dark before i get there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were going the other way oh i wasnt going no place in particular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be pleased to keep you company down to the school and back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was surprised they set off together chatting as freely as if they had known one another for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben had been on his way to the byers farm as usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the byers farm and emma byers passed out of his mind as completely as if they had been whisked away on a magic bella huckins had never meant to marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the huckinses lived above the saloon in commercial and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huckins was always boiling ham and tongue and cooking pigs feet and shredding cabbage for slaw all these edibles being destined for the freelunch counter downstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bella had early made up her mind that there should be no boiling and stewing and frying in her life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever she could find an excuse she loitered about the saloon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there she found life and talk and color <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old red front huckins used to chase her away but she always turned up again somehow with a dish for the lunch ben westerveld never said clearly to himself i want to marry bella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this thing was too strong for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for bella she laughed at him but she was scared too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they both fought the thing she selfishly he unselfishly for the byers girl with her clear calm eyes and her dependable ways was heavy on his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bens appeal for bella was merely that of the magnetic male <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she never once thought of his finer qualities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her appeal for him was that of the frail and alluring woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the emperors decius gallus aemilianus valerian and gallienus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the great secular games celebrated by philip to the death of the emperor gallienus there elapsed twenty years of shame and misfortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during that calamitous period every instant of time was marked every province of the roman world was afflicted by barbarous invaders and military tyrants and the ruined empire seemed to approach the last and fatal moment of its dissolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the confusion of the times and the scarcity of authentic memorials oppose equal difficulties to the historian who attempts to preserve a clear and unbroken thread of narration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surrounded with imperfect fragments always concise often obscure and sometimes contradictory he is reduced to collect to compare and to conjecture and though he ought never to place his conjectures in the rank of facts yet the knowledge of human nature and of the sure operation of its fierce and unrestrained passions might on some occasions supply the want of historical materials <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is not for instance any difficulty in conceiving that the successive murders of so many emperors had loosened all the ties of allegiance between the prince and people that all the generals of philip were disposed to imitate the example of their master and that the caprice of armies long since habituated to frequent and violent revolutions might every day raise to the throne the most obscure of their fellowsoldiers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> history can only add that the rebellion against the emperor philip broke out in the summer of the year two hundred and fortynine among the legions of maesia and that a subaltern officer named marinus was the object of their seditious choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dreaded lest the treason of the maesian army should prove the first spark of a general conflagration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> distracted with the consciousness of his guilt and of his danger he communicated the intelligence to the senate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gloomy silence prevailed the effect of fear and perhaps of disaffection till at length decius one of the assembly assuming a spirit worthy of his noble extraction ventured to discover more intrepidity than the emperor seemed to possess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he treated the whole business with contempt as a hasty and inconsiderate tumult and philips rival as a phantom of royalty who in a very few days would be destroyed by the same inconstancy that had created him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the speedy completion of the prophecy inspired philip with a just esteem for so able a counsellor and decius appeared to him the only person capable of restoring peace and discipline to an army whose tumultuous spirit did not immediately subside after the murder of marinus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> decius who long resisted his own nomination seems to have insinuated the danger of presenting a leader of merit to the angry and apprehensive minds of the soldiers and his prediction was again confirmed by the event <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the legions of maesia forced their judge to become their accomplice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they left him only the alternative of death or the purple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his subsequent conduct after that decisive measure was unavoidable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he conducted or followed his army to the confines of italy whither philip collecting all his force to repel the formidable competitor whom he had raised up advanced to meet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the imperial troops were superior in number but the rebels formed an army of veterans commanded by an able and experienced leader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philip was either killed in the battle or put to death a few days afterwards at verona <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his son and associate in the empire was massacred at rome by the praetorian guards and the victorious decius with more favorable circumstances than the ambition of that age can usually plead was universally acknowledged by the senate and provinces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is reported that immediately after his reluctant acceptance of the title of augustus he had assured philip by a private message of his innocence and loyalty solemnly protesting that on his arrival on italy he would resign the imperial ornaments and return to the condition of an obedient subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his professions might be sincere but in the situation where fortune had placed him it was scarcely possible that he could either forgive or be footnote the expression used by zosimus and zonaras may footnote his birth at bubalia a little village in pannonia eutrop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seems to contradict unless it was merely accidental his supposed descent from the decii <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six hundred years had bestowed nobility on the decii but at the commencement of that period they were only plebeians of merit and among the first who shared the consulship with the haughty patricians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see the spirited speech of decius in livy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the emperor decius had employed a few months in the works of peace and the administration of justice when he was summoned to the banks of the danube by the invasion of the goths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the first considerable occasion in which history mentions that great people who afterwards broke the roman power sacked the capitol and reigned in gaul spain and italy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so memorable was the part which they acted in the subversion of the western empire that the name of goths is frequently but improperly used as a general appellation ef rude and warlike barbarism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the beginning of the sixth century and after the conquest of italy the goths in possession of present greatness very naturally indulged themselves in the prospect of past and of future glory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wished to preserve the memory of their ancestors and to transmit to posterity their own achievements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the principal minister of the court of ravenna the learned cassiodorus gratified the inclination of the conquerors in a gothic history which consisted of twelve books now reduced to the imperfect abridgment of jornandes <end> <end>

<start> <start> it is supposed that odin was the chief of a tribe of barbarians which dwelt on the banks of the lake maeotis till the fall of mithridates and the arms of pompey menaced the north with servitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that odin yielding with indignant fury to a power which he was unable to resist conducted his tribe from the frontiers of the asiatic sarmatia into sweden with the great design of forming in that inaccessible retreat of freedom a religion and a people which in some remote age might be subservient to his immortal revenge when his invincible goths armed with martial fanaticism should issue in numerous swarms from the neighborhood of the polar circle to chastise the footnote mallet c <end> <end>

<start> <start> according to the obvious sense of the edda and the interpretation of the most skilful critics asgard instead of denoting a real city of the asiatic sarmatia is the fictitious appellation of the mystic abode of the gods the olympus of scandinavia from whence the prophet was supposed to descend when he announced his new religion to the gothic nations who were already seated in the southern parts of sweden <end> <end>

<start> <start> the asiatic origin of the goths is almost certain from the affinity of their language to the sanscrit and persian but their northern writers when all mythology was reduced to hero worship <end> <end>

<start> <start> here at length we land on firm and historic ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least as early as the christian aera and as late as the age of the antonines the goths were established towards the mouth of the vistula and in that fertile province where the commercial cities of thorn elbing koningsberg and dantzick were long afterwards founded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> westward of the goths the numerous tribes of the vandals were spread along the banks of the oder and the seacoast of pomerania and mecklenburgh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a striking resemblance of manners complexion religion and language seemed to indicate that the vandals and the goths were originally one great people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter appear to have been subdivided into ostrogoths visigoths and gepidae <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the distinction among the vandals was more strongly marked by the independent names of heruli burgundians lombards and a variety of other petty states many of which in a future age expanded themselves into powerful monarchies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we could yield a firm assent to the navigations of pytheas of marseilles we must allow that the goths had passed the baltic at least three hundred years footnote by the german colonies who followed the arms of the teutonic knights <end> <end>

<start> <start> the third being a heavy sailer lagged behind and the crew which afterwards swelled into a nation received from that circumstance the appellation of gepidae or loiterers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> note it was not in scandinavia that the goths were divided into ostrogoths and visigoths that division took place after their irruption into dacia in the third century those who came from mecklenburgh and pomerania were called visigoths those who came from the south of prussia and the northwest of poland called themselves ostrogoths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> footnote this opinion is by no means probable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vandals and the goths equally belonged to the great division of the suevi but the two tribes were very different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who have treated on this part of history appear to me to have neglected to remark that the ancients almost always gave the name of the dominant and conquering people to all the weaker and conquered races <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so pliny calls vindeli vandals all the people of the northeast of europe because at that epoch the vandals were doubtless the conquering tribe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caesar on the contrary ranges under the name of suevi many of the tribes whom pliny reckons as vandals because the suevi properly so called were then the most powerful tribe in germany <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the goths become in their turn conquerors had subjugated the nations whom they encountered on their way these nations lost their name with their liberty and became of gothic origin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vandals themselves were then considered as goths the heruli the gepidae c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a common origin was thus attributed to tribes who had only been united by the conquests of some dominant nation and this confusion has given rise to a number of historical errors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin has a learned note to le beau v <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the difficulty appears to be in rejecting the close analogy of the name with the vend or wendish race who were of sclavonian not of suevian or german origin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin supposes that the different races spread from the head of the adriatic to the baltic and even the veneti on the shores of the adriatic the vindelici the tribes which gave their name to vindobena vindoduna vindonissa were branches of the same stock with the sclavonian venedi who at one time gave their name to the baltic that they all spoke dialects of the wendish language which still prevails in carinthia carniola part of bohemia and lusatia and is hardly extinct in mecklenburgh and pomerania <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vandal race once so fearfully celebrated in the annals of mankind has so utterly perished from the face of the earth that we are not aware that any vestiges of their language can be traced so as to throw light on the disputed question of their german their sclavonian or independent origin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the weight of ancient authority seems against m <end> <end>

<start> <start> in this interval therefore of about seventy years we must place the second migration of about seventy years we must place the second migration of the goths from the baltic to the euxine but the cause that produced it lies concealed among the various motives which actuate the conduct of unsettled barbarians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either a pestilence or a famine a victory or a defeat an oracle of the gods or the eloquence of a daring leader were sufficient to impel the gothic arms on the milder climates of the south <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides the influence of a martial religion the numbers and spirit of the goths were equal to the most dangerous adventures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the use of round bucklers and short swords rendered them formidable in a close engagement the manly obedience which they yielded to hereditary kings gave uncommon union and stability to their councils and the renowned amala the hero of that age and the tenth ancestor of theodoric king of italy enforced by the ascendant of personal merit the prerogative of his birth which he derived footnote see a fragment of peter patricius in the excerpta legationum and with regard to its probable date see tillemont footnote omnium harum gentium insigne rotunda scuta breves gladii et erga rages obsequium <end> <end>

<start> <start> the bastarnae dwelt on the northern side of the carpathian mountains the immense tract of land that separated the bastarnae from the savages of finland was possessed or rather wasted by the venedi we have some reason to believe that the first of these nations which distinguished itself in the macedonian war and was afterwards divided into the formidable tribes of the peucini the borani the carpi c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with better authority a sarmatian extraction may be assigned to the venedi who rendered themselves so famous in the middle ages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the confusion of blood and manners on that doubtful frontier often perplexed the most accurate observers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the goths advanced near the euxine sea they encountered a purer race of sarmatians the jazyges the alani and the roxolani and they were probably the first germans who saw the mouths of the borysthenes and of the tanais <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we inquire into the characteristic marks of the people of germany and of sarmatia we shall discover that those two great portions of human kind were principally distinguished by fixed huts or movable tents by a close dress or flowing garments by the marriage of one or of several wives by a military force consisting for the most part either of infantry or cavalry and above all by the use of the teutonic or of the sclavonian language the last of which has been diffused by conquest from the confines of italy to the neighborhood of japan <end> <end>

<start> <start> many attempts have recently been made in france to compare the public expenditure of that country with the expenditure of the united states all these attempts have however been unattended by success and a few words will suffice to show that they could not have had a satisfactory result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in order to estimate the amount of the public charges of a people two preliminaries are indispensable it is necessary in the first place to know the wealth of that people and in the second to learn what portion of that wealth is devoted to the expenditure of the state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to show the amount of taxation without showing the resources which are destined to meet the demand is to undertake a futile labor for it is not the expenditure but the relation of the expenditure to the revenue which it is the same rate of taxation which may easily be supported by a wealthy contributor will reduce a poor one to extreme misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wealth of nations is composed of several distinct elements of which population is the first real property the second and personal property the third <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first of these three elements may be discovered without difficulty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amongst civilized nations it is easy to obtain an accurate census of the inhabitants but the two others cannot be determined with so much facility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is difficult to take an exact account of all the lands in a country which are under cultivation with their natural or their acquired value and it is still more impossible to estimate the entire personal property which is at the disposal of a nation and which eludes the strictest analysis by the diversity and the number of shapes under which it may occur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and indeed we find that the most ancient civilized nations of europe including even those in which the administration is most central have not succeeded as yet in determining the exact condition of their wealth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in america the attempt has never been made for how would such an investigation be possible in a country where society has not yet settled into habits of regularity and tranquillity where the national government is not assisted by a multiple of agents whose exertions it can command and direct to one sole end and where statistics are not studied because no one is able to collect the necessary documents or to find time to peruse them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus the primary elements of the calculations which have been made in france cannot be obtained in the union the relative wealth of the two countries is unknown the property of the former is not accurately determined and no means exist of i consent therefore for the sake of the discussion to abandon this necessary term of the comparison and i confine myself to a computation of the actual amount of taxation without investigating the relation which subsists between the taxation and the revenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the reader will perceive that my task has not been facilitated by the limits which i here lay down for my researches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it cannot be doubted that the central administration of france assisted by all the public officers who are at its disposal might determine with exactitude the amount of the direct and indirect taxes levied upon the citizens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this investigation which no private individual can undertake has not hitherto been completed by the french government or at least its results have not been made public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are acquainted with the sum total of the charges of the state we know the amount of the departmental expenditure but the expenses of the communal divisions have not been computed and the amount of the public expenses of france is consequently unknown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we now turn to america we shall perceive that the difficulties are multiplied and enhanced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the union publishes an exact return of the amount of its expenditure the budgets of the four and twenty states furnish similar returns of their revenues but the expenses incident to the affairs of the counties and the footnote k the americans as we have seen have four separate budgets the union the states the counties and the townships having each severally their own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during my stay in america i made every endeavor to discover the amount of the public expenditure in the townships and counties of the principal states of the union and i readily obtained the budget of the larger townships but i found it quite impossible to procure that of the smaller ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i possess however some documents relating to county expenses which although incomplete are still curious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> richards mayor of philadelphia for the budgets of thirteen of the counties of pennsylvania viz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lebanon centre franklin fayette montgomery luzerne dauphin butler alleghany columbia northampton northumberland and philadelphia for the year their population at that time consisted of inhabitants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on looking at the map of pennsylvania it will be seen that these thirteen counties are scattered in every direction and so generally affected by the causes which usually influence the condition of a country that they may easily be supposed to furnish a correct average of the financial state of the counties of pennsylvania in general and thus upon reckoning that the expenses of these counties amounted in the year to about or nearly cents for each inhabitant and calculating that each of them contributed in the same year about towards the union and about cents to the state of pennsylvania it appears that they each contributed as their share of all the public expenses except those of the townships the sum of this calculation is doubly incomplete as it applies only to a single year and to one part of the public charges but it has at least the merit of not being the authority of the federal government cannot oblige the provincial governments to throw any light upon this point and even if these governments were inclined to afford their simultaneous co operation it may be doubted whether they possess the means of procuring a satisfactory answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> independently of the natural difficulties of the task the political organization of the country would act as a hindrance to the success of their efforts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the county and town magistrates are not appointed by the authorities of the state and they are not subjected to their control <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is therefore very allowable to suppose that if the state was desirous of obtaining the returns which we require its design would be counteracted by the neglect of those subordinate officers whom it would be obliged to employ <end> <end> 
<start> <start> l it is in point of fact useless to inquire what the americans might do to forward this inquiry since it is certain that they have hitherto done nothing at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there does not exist a single individual at the present day in america or in europe who can inform us what each citizen of the union annually contributes to the public charges of the nation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> m footnote l those who have attempted to draw a comparison between the expenses of france and america have at once perceived that no such comparison could be drawn between the total expenditure of the two countries but they have endeavored to contrast detached portions of this expenditure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may readily be shown that this second system is not at all less defective than the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i attempt to compare the french budget with the budget of the union it must be remembered that the latter embraces much fewer objects than then central government of the former country and that the expenditure must consequently be much smaller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i contrast the budgets of the departments with those of the states which constitute the union it must be observed that as the power and control exercised by the states is much greater than that which is exercised by the departments their expenditure is also more considerable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the budgets of the counties nothing of the kind occurs in the french system of finances and it is again doubtful whether the corresponding expenses should be referred to the budget of the state or to those of the municipal divisions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> municipal expenses exist in both countries but they are not always analogous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in america the townships discharge a variety of offices which are reserved in france to the departments or to the state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may moreover be asked what is to be understood by the municipal expenses of america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the organization of the municipal bodies or townships differs in the several states <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are we to be guided by what occurs in new england or in georgia in pennsylvania or in the state of illinois <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a kind of analogy may very readily be perceived between certain budgets in the two countries but as the elements of which they are composed always differ more or less no fair comparison can be instituted between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same difficulty exists perhaps to a greater degree at the present time when the taxation of america has largely increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> footnote m even if we knew the exact pecuniary contributions of every french and american citizen to the coffers of the state we should only come at a portion of the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> governments do not only demand supplies of money but they call for personal services which may be looked upon as equivalent to a given sum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a state raises an army besides the pay of the troops which is furnished by the entire nation each soldier must give up his time the value of which depends on the use he might make of it if he were not in the service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same remark applies to the militia the citizen who is in the militia devotes a certain portion of valuable time to the maintenance of the public peace and he does in reality surrender to the state those earnings which he is prevented from gaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many other instances might be cited in addition to these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the governments of france and of america both levy taxes of this kind which weigh upon the citizens but who can estimate with accuracy their relative this however is not the last of the difficulties which prevent us from comparing the expenditure of the union with that of france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the french government contracts certain obligations which do not exist in america and vice versa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the french government pays the clergy in america the voluntary principle prevails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in america there is a legal provision for the poor in france they are abandoned to the charity of the public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the french public officers are paid by a fixed salary in america they are allowed certain perquisites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in france contributions in kind take place on very few roads in america upon almost all the thoroughfares in the former country the roads are free to all travellers in the latter turnpikes abound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all these differences in the manner in which contributions are levied in the two countries enhance the difficulty of comparing their expenditure for there are certain expenses which the citizens would not be subject to or which would at any rate be much less considerable if the state did not take upon itself to act in the hence we must conclude that it is no less difficult to compare the social expenditure than it is to estimate the relative wealth of france and america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will even add that it would be dangerous to attempt this comparison for when statistics are not based upon computations which are strictly accurate they mislead instead of guiding aright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mind is easily imposed upon by the false affectation of exactness which prevails even in the misstatements of science and it adopts with confidence errors which are dressed in the forms of mathematical truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we abandon therefore our numerical investigation with the hope of meeting with data of another kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the absence of positive documents we may form an opinion as to the proportion which the taxation of a people bears to its real prosperity by observing whether its external appearance is flourishing whether after having discharged the calls of the state the poor man retains the means of subsistence and the rich the means of enjoyment and whether both classes are contented with their position seeking however to ameliorate it by perpetual exertions so that industry is never in want of capital nor capital unemployed by industry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the observer who draws his inferences from these signs will undoubtedly be led to the conclusion that the american of the united states contributes a much smaller portion of his income to the state than the citizen of france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a portion of the french debt is the consequence of two successive invasions and the union has no similar calamity to fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a nation placed upon the continent of europe is obliged to maintain a large standing army the isolated position of the union enables it to have only soldiers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the french have a fleet of sail the americans have vessels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> n how then can the inhabitants of the union be called upon to contribute as largely as the inhabitants of france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no parallel can be drawn between the finances of two countries so differently situated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the canon and the curate were bursting with laughter the officers were capering with delight and both the one and the other hissed them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sancho alone was frantic for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of the canons servants who kept him from going to his masters assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last while they were all with the exception of the two bruisers who were mauling each other in high glee and enjoyment they heard a trumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction whence the sound seemed to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the one that was most excited by hearing it was don quixote who though sorely against his will he was under the goatherd and something more than pretty well pummelled said to him brother devil for it is impossible but that thou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine i ask thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the goatherd who was by this time tired of pummelling and being pummelled released him at once and don quixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from the earth and in all the villages of the district they were organising processions rogations and penances imploring god to open the hands of his mercy and send the rain and to this end the people of a village that was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was on one side of that valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> don quixote when he saw the strange garb of the penitents without reflecting how often he had seen it before took it into his head that this was a case of adventure and that it fell to him alone as a knighterrant to engage in it and he was all the more confirmed in this notion by the idea that an image draped in black they had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and discourteous thieves were carrying off by force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as this occurred to him he ran with all speed to rocinante who was grazing at large and taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddlebow he had him bridled in an instant and calling to sancho for his sword he mounted rocinante braced his buckler on his arm and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who stood by now noble company ye shall see how important it is that there should be knights in the world professing the of knighterrantry now i say ye shall see by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there whether knightserrant deserve to be held in estimation and so saying he brought his legs to bear on rocinante for he had no spurs and at a full canter for in all this veracious history we never read of rocinante fairly galloping set off to encounter the penitents though the curate the canon and the barber ran to prevent him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was out of their power nor did he even stop for the shouts of sancho calling after him where are you going senor don quixote <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what devils have possessed you to set you on against our catholic faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mind that is a procession of penitents and the lady they are carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate virgin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take care what you are doing senor for this time it may be safely said you dont know what you are about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sancho laboured in vain for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word and even had he heard he would not have turned back if the king had ordered him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came up with the procession and reined in rocinante who was already anxious enough to slacken speed a little and in a hoarse excited voice he exclaimed you who hide your faces perhaps because you are not good subjects pay attention and listen to what i am about to say to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first to halt were those who were carrying the image and one of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the litany struck by the strange figure of don quixote the leanness of rocinante and the other ludicrous peculiarities he observed said in reply to him brother if you have anything to say to us say it quickly for these brethren are whipping themselves and we cannot stop nor is it reasonable we should stop to hear anything unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will say it in one replied don quixote and it is this that at once this very instant ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will and that ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her and i who was born into the world to redress all such like wrongs will not permit you to advance another step until you have restored to her the liberty she pines for and deserves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman and began to laugh heartily and their laughter acted like gunpowder on don quixotes fury for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush at the stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of those who supported it leaving the burden to his comrades advanced to meet him flourishing a forked stick that he had for propping up the stand when resting and with this he caught a mighty cut don quixote made at him that severed it in two but with the portion that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of don quixotes sword arm which the buckler could not protect against the clownish assault that poor don quixote came to the ground in a sad plight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sancho panza who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing seeing him fall cried out to his assailant not to strike him again for he was poor enchanted knight who had never harmed anyone all the days of his life but what checked the clown was not sanchos shouting but seeing that don quixote did not stir hand or foot and so fancying he had killed him he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to his heels across the country like a deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time all don quixotes companions had come up to where he lay but the processionists seeing them come running and with them the officers of the brotherhood with their crossbows apprehended mischief and clustering round the image raised their hoods and grasped their scourges as the priests did their tapers and awaited the attack resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against their assailants if they could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortune however arranged the matter better than they expected for all sancho did was to fling himself on his masters body raising over him the most doleful and laughable lamentation that ever was heard for he believed he was dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the curate was known to another curate who walked in the procession and their recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both parties the first then told the other in two words who don quixote was and he and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was dead and heard sancho panza saying with tears in his eyes oh flower of chivalry that with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy wellspent life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh pride of thy race honour and glory of all la mancha nay of all the world that for want of thee will be full of evildoers no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh thou generous above all the alexanders since for only eight months of service thou hast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> humble with the proud haughty with the humble encounterer of dangers endurer of outrages enamoured without reason imitator of the good scourge of the wicked enemy of the mean in short knighterrant which is all that can be said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the cries and moans of sancho don quixote came to himself and the first word he said was he who lives separated from you sweetest dulcinea has greater miseries to endure than these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aid me friend sancho to mount the enchanted cart for i am not in a condition to press the saddle of rocinante as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i will do with all my heart senor said sancho and let us return to our village with these gentlemen who seek your good and there we will prepare for making another sally which may turn out more profitable and creditable to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou art right sancho returned don quixote it will be wise to let the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the canon the curate and the barber told him he would act very wisely in doing as he said and so highly amused at sancho panzas simplicities they placed don quixote in the cart as before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road the goatherd took his leave of the party the officers of the brotherhood declined to go any farther and the curate paid them what was due to them the canon begged the curate to let him know how don quixote did whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it and then begged leave to continue his journey in short they all separated and went their ways leaving to themselves the curate and the barber don quixote sancho panza and the good rocinante who regarded everything with as great resignation as his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the carter yoked his oxen and made don quixote comfortable on a truss of hay and at his usual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed and at the end of six days they reached don quixotes village and entered it about the middle of the day which it so happened was a sunday and the people were all in the plaza through which don quixotes cart passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all flocked to see what was in the cart and when they recognised their townsman they were filled with amazement and a boy ran off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an oxcart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those accursed books of chivalry all which was renewed when they saw don quixote coming in at the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the news of don quixotes arrival sancho panzas wife came running for she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as his squire and on seeing sancho the first thing she asked him was if the ass was well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sancho replied that he was better than his master was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thanks be to god said she for being so good to me but now tell me my friend what have you made by your squirings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bring nothing of that sort wife said sancho though i bring other things of more consequence and value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very glad of that returned his wife show me these things of more value and consequence my friend for i want to see them to cheer my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will show them to you at home wife said sancho be content for the present for if it please god that we should again go on our travels in search of adventures you will soon see me a count or governor of an island and that not one of those everyday ones but the best that is to be had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heaven grant it husband said she for indeed we have need of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tell me whats this about islands for i dont understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> honey is not for the mouth of the ass returned sancho all in good time thou shalt see wife nay thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself called your ladyship by all thy vassals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are you talking about sancho with your ladyships islands and vassals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returned teresa panza for so sanchos wife was called though they were not relations for in la mancha it is customary for wives to take their husbands surnames <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont be in such a hurry to know all this teresa said sancho it is enough that i am telling you the truth so shut your mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i may tell you this much by the way that there is nothing in the world more delightful than to be a person of consideration squire to a knighterrant and a seeker of adventures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be sure most of those one finds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish for out of a hundred ninetynine will turn out cross and contrary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know it by experience for out of some i came blanketed and out of others belaboured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still for all that it is a fine thing to be on the lookout for what may happen crossing mountains searching woods climbing rocks visiting castles putting up at inns all at free quarters and devil take the maravedi to pay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while this conversation passed between sancho panza and his wife don quixotes housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid him in his old bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he eyed them askance and could not make out where he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape from them again telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring him home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry and implored heaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the bottomless pit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were in short kept in anxiety and dread lest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he found himself somewhat better and as they feared so it fell out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the author of this history though he has devoted research and industry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by don quixote in his third sally has been unable to obtain any information respecting them at any rate derived from authentic documents tradition has merely preserved in the memory of la mancha the fact that don quixote the third time he sallied forth from his home betook himself to saragossa where he was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city and that he had adventures there worthy of his valour and high intelligence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of his end and death he could learn no particulars nor would he have ascertained it or known of it if good fortune had not produced an old physician for him who had in his possession a leaden box which according to his account had been discovered among the crumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt in which box were found certain parchment manuscripts in gothic character but in castilian verse containing many of his achievements and setting forth the beauty of dulcinea the form of rocinante the fidelity of sancho panza and the burial of don quixote himself together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character but all that could be read and deciphered were those which the trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here presents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the said author asks of those that shall read it nothing in return for the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and searching the manchegan archives in order to bring it to light save that they give him the same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry that pervade the world and are so popular for with this he will consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied and will be encouraged to seek out and produce other histories if not as truthful at least equal in invention and not less entertaining <end> <end>

<start> <start> and he who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the great emperor of china who wrote me a letter in chinese a month ago and sent it by a special courier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked me or to be truthful he begged me to send him don quixote for he intended to found a college where the spanish tongue would be taught and it was his wish that the book to be read should be the history of don quixote <end> <end>

<start> <start> what i cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being old and onehanded as if it had been in my power to keep time from passing over me or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in some tavern and not on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen or the future can hope to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if my wounds have no beauty to the beholders eye they are at least honourable in the estimation of those who know where they were received for the soldier shows to greater advantage dead in battle than alive in flight and so strongly is this my feeling that if now it were proposed to perform an impossibility for me i would rather have had my share in that mighty action than be free from my wounds this minute without having been present at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those the soldier shows on his face and breast are stars that direct others to the heaven of honour and ambition of merited praise and moreover it is to be observed that it is not with grey hairs that one writes but with the understanding and that commonly improves with years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i take it amiss too that he calls me envious and explains to me as if i were ignorant what envy is for really and truly of the two kinds there are i only know that which is holy noble and highminded and if that be so as it is i am not likely to attack a priest above all if in addition he holds the rank of familiar of the holy office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if he said what he did on account of him on whose behalf it seems he spoke he is entirely mistaken for i worship the genius of that person and admire his works and his unceasing and strenuous industry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all i am grateful to this gentleman the author for saying that my novels are more satirical than exemplary but that they are good for they could not be that unless there was a little of everything in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suspect thou wilt say that i am taking a very humble line and keeping myself too much within the bounds of my moderation from a feeling that additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer and that what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great as he does not dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight but hides his name and disguises his country as if he had been guilty of some lese majesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if perchance thou shouldst come to know him tell him from me that i do not hold myself aggrieved for i know well what the temptations of the devil are and that one of the greatest is putting it into a mans head that he can write and print a book by which he will get as much fame as money and as much money as fame and to prove it i will beg of you in your own sprightly pleasant way to tell him this story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a madman in seville who took to one of the drollest absurdities and vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was this he made a tube of reed sharp at one end and catching a dog in the street or wherever it might be he with his foot held one of its legs fast and with his hand lifted up the other and as best he could fixed the tube where by blowing he made the dog as round as a ball then holding it in this position he gave it a couple of slaps on the belly and let it go saying to the bystanders and there were always plenty of them do your worships think now that it is an easy thing to blow up a dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does your worship think now that it is an easy thing to write a book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if this story does not suit him you may dear reader tell him this one which is likewise of a madman and a dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in cordova there was another madman whose way it was to carry a piece of marble slab or a stone not of the lightest on his head and when he came upon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let the weight fall right on top of him on which the dog in a rage barking and howling would run three streets without stopping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it so happened however that one of the dogs he discharged his load upon was a capmakers dog of which his master was very fond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stone came down hitting it on the head the dog raised a yell at the blow the master saw the affair and was wroth and snatching up a measuringyard rushed out at the madman and did not leave a sound bone in his body and at every stroke he gave him he said you dog you thief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you see you brute that my dog is a lurcher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so repeating the word lurcher again and again he sent the madman away beaten to a jelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the madman took the lesson to heart and vanished and for more than a month never once showed himself in public but after that he came out again with his old trick and a heavier load than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came up to where there was a dog and examining it very carefully without venturing to let the stone fall he said this is a lurcher ware <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short all the dogs he came across be they mastiffs or terriers he said were lurchers and he discharged no more stones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe it will be the same with this historian that he will not venture another time to discharge the weight of his wit in books which being bad are harder than stones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him too that i do not care a farthing for the threat he holds out to me of depriving me of my profit by means of his book for to borrow from the famous interlude of the perendenga i say in answer to him long life to my lord the veintiquatro and christ be with us all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long life to the great conde de lemos whose christian charity and wellknown generosity support me against all the strokes of my curst fortune and long life to the supreme benevolence of his eminence of toledo don bernardo de sandoval y rojas and what matter if there be no printingpresses in the world or if they print more books against me than there are letters in the verses of mingo revulgo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these two princes unsought by any adulation or flattery of mine of their own goodness alone have taken it upon them to show me kindness and protect me and in this i consider myself happier and richer than if fortune had raised me to her greatest height in the ordinary way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor man may retain honour but not the vicious poverty may cast a cloud over nobility but cannot hide it altogether and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light even though it be through the straits and chinks of penury it wins the esteem of lofty and noble spirits and in consequence their protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou needst say no more to him nor will i say anything more to thee save to tell thee to bear in mind that this second part of don quixote which i offer thee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth as the first and that in it i present thee don quixote continued and at length dead and buried so that no one may dare to bring forward any further evidence against him for that already produced is sufficient and suffice it too that some reputable person should have given an account of all these shrewd lunacies of his without going into the matter again for abundance even of good things prevents them from being valued and scarcity even in the case of what is bad confers a certain value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was forgetting to tell thee that thou mayest expect the persiles which i am now finishing and also the second part of galatea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the interview the curate and the barber had with don quixote cide hamete benengeli in the second part of this history and third sally of don quixote says that the curate and the barber remained nearly a month without seeing him lest they should recall or bring back to his recollection what had taken place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did not however omit to visit his niece and housekeeper and charge them to be careful to treat him with attention and give him comforting things to eat and such as were good for the heart and the brain whence it was plain to see all his misfortune proceeded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the niece and housekeeper replied that they did so and meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity for they could perceive that their master was now and then beginning to show signs of being in his right mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gave great satisfaction to the curate and the barber for they concluded they had taken the right course in carrying him off enchanted on the oxcart as has been described in the first part of this great as well as accurate history in the last chapter thereof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they resolved to pay him a visit and test the improvement in his condition although they thought it almost impossible that there could be any and they agreed not to touch upon any point connected with knighterrantry so as not to run the risk of reopening wounds which were still so tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came to see him consequently and found him sitting up in bed in a green baize waistcoat and a red toledo cap and so withered and dried up that he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were very cordially received by him they asked him after his health and he talked to them about himself very naturally and in very wellchosen language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the course of their conversation they fell to discussing what they call statecraft and systems of government correcting this abuse and condemning that reforming one practice and abolishing another each of the three setting up for a new legislator a modern lycurgus or a brandnew solon and so completely did they remodel the state that they seemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out something quite different from what they had put in and on all the subjects they dealt with don quixote spoke with such good sense that the pair of examiners were fully convinced that he was quite recovered and in his full senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could not find words enough to express their thanks to god at seeing their master so clear in his mind the curate however changing his original plan which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry resolved to test don quixotes recovery thoroughly and see whether it were genuine or not and so from one subject to another he came at last to talk of the news that had come from the capital and among other things he said it was considered certain that the turk was coming down with a powerful fleet and that no one knew what his purpose was or when the great storm would burst and that all christendom was in apprehension of this which almost every year calls us to arms and that his majesty had made provision for the security of the coasts of naples and sicily and the island of malta <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this don quixote replied his majesty has acted like a prudent warrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time so that the enemy may not find him unprepared but if my advice were taken i would recommend him to adopt a measure which at present no doubt his majesty is very far from thinking of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment the curate heard this he said to himself god keep thee in his hand poor don quixote for it seems to me thou art precipitating thyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thy simplicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the barber who had the same suspicion as the curate asked don quixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought to be adopted for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to be added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were in the habit of offering to princes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mine master shaver said don quixote will not be impertinent but on the contrary pertinent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mean that said the barber but that experience has shown that all or most of the expedients which are proposed to his majesty are either impossible or absurd or injurious to the king and to the kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mine however replied don quixote is neither impossible nor absurd but the easiest the most reasonable the readiest and most expeditious that could suggest itself to any projectors mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you take a long time to tell it senor don quixote said the curate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont choose to tell it here now said don quixote and have it reach the ears of the lords of the council tomorrow morning and some other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my part said the barber i give my word here and before god that i will not repeat what your worship says to king rook or earthly man an oath i learned from the ballad of the curate who in the prelude told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred gold crowns and his pacing mule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not versed in stories said don quixote but i know the oath is a good one because i know the barber to be an honest fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if he were not said the curate i will go bail and answer for him that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy under pain of paying any penalty that may be pronounced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and who will be security for you senor curate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my profession replied the curate which is to keep secrets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said don quixote at this what more has his majesty to do but to command by public proclamation all the knightserrant that are scattered over spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital for even if no more than half a dozen come there may be one among them who alone will suffice to destroy the entire might of the turk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it pray any new thing for a single knighterrant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men as if they all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay tell me how many histories are there filled with these marvels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if only in an evil hour for me i dont speak for anyone else the famous don belianis were alive now or any one of the innumerable progeny of amadis of gaul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any these were alive today and were to come face to face with the turk by my faith i would not give much for the turks chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but god will have regard for his people and will provide some one who if not so valiant as the knightserrant of yore at least will not be inferior to them in spirit but god knows what i mean and i say no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the niece at this may i die if my master does not want to turn knighterrant again to which don quixote replied a knighterrant i shall die and let the turk come down or go up when he likes and in as strong force as he can once more i say god knows what i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here the barber said i ask your worships to give me leave to tell a short story of something that happened in seville which comes so pat to the purpose just now that i should like greatly to tell it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> don quixote gave him leave and the rest prepared in the madhouse at seville there was a man whom his relations had placed there as being out of his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a graduate of osuna in canon law but even if he had been of salamanca it was the opinion of most people that he would have been mad all the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this graduate after some years of confinement took it into his head that he was sane and in his full senses and under this impression wrote to the archbishop entreating him earnestly and in very correct language to have him released from the misery in which he was living for by gods mercy he had now recovered his lost reason though his relations in order to enjoy his property kept him there and in spite of the truth would make him out to be mad until his dying day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the archbishop moved by repeated sensible wellwritten letters directed one of his chaplains to make inquiry of the madhouse as to the truth of the licentiates statements and to have an interview with the madman himself and if it should appear that he was in his senses to take him out and restore him to liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chaplain did so and the governor assured him that the man was still mad and that though he often spoke like a highly intelligent person he would in the end break out into nonsense that in quantity and quality counterbalanced all the sensible things he had said before as might be easily tested by talking to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a bay tree in blossom near the mineral spring and i wish to get some of the flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i specs youd find some bay trees long de big road maam said julius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i know about the flowers on the short road and they are the ones i want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we drove down the lane to the highway and soon struck into the short road leading past the mineral spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our route lay partly through a swamp and on each side the dark umbrageous foliage unbroken by any clearing lent to the road solemnity and to the air a refreshing coolness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about half a mile from the house and about halfway to the mineral spring we stopped at the tree of which my wife had spoken and reaching up to the lowhanging boughs i gathered a dozen of the fragrant white flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i resumed my seat in the rockaway julius started the mare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went on for a few rods until we had reached the edge of a branch crossing the road when she stopped short <end> <end> 
<start> <start> julius jerked the reins and applied the whip lightly but the mare did not stir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps you had better get down and lead her i suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you get her started you can cross on the log and keep your feet dry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> julius alighted took hold of the bridle and vainly essayed to make the mare move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she planted her feet with even more evident obstinacy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what to make of this i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never known her to balk before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no suh replied the old man i nebber has <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats the best way to make her go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i specs suh dat ef id tun her roun shed go de udder way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we want her to go this way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well suh i low ef we des set heah fo er fibe minutes shell stat up by hersef <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all right i rejoined it is cooler here than any place i have struck today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well let her stand for a while and see what she does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had sat in silence for a few minutes when julius suddenly ejaculated uh huh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chloes done ben dead dese foty years er mo the old man returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her hant is settin ober yander on de udder side er de branch unner dat willer tree dis blessed minute <end> <end>

<start> <start> well suh dis yer is a gray hoss en dis yer is a friday en a gray hoss kin alluz see a hant wat walks on friday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all in de tale maam julius replied with a deep sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps by the time you get through the haunt will go away and the mare will cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was willing to humor the old mans fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not told us a story for some time and the dark and solemn swamp around us the ambercolored stream flowing silently and sluggishly at our feet like the waters of lethe the heavy aromatic scent of the bays faintly suggestive of funeral wreathsall made the place an ideal one for a ghost story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chloe julius began in a subdued tone use ter blong ter ole mars dugal mcadoomy ole marster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wuz a ladly gal en a smart gal en ole mis tuk her up ter de big house en larnt her ter wait on de wite folks tel bimeby she come ter be miss own maid en peared ter low she run de house hersef ter heah her talk erbout it <end> <end>

<start> <start> for we must be a credit to the queen as well as the good greenwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you much with stout will lester and john the widows three sons shall have command of the band while we are away and friar tuck shall preside over the needs of your souls and stomachs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the orders were received with shouts of approval and toasts all around were drunk again in nutbrown ale ere the company dispersed to rest after making ready for the journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning was as fine a summers day as ever you want to see and the green leaves of the forest made a pleasing background for the gay picture of the yeomen setting forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says the old balladit was a seemly sight to see how robin hood himself had dressed and all his yeomanry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clothed his men in lincoln green and himself in scarlet red with hats of black and feathers white to bravely deck each head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor were the two ladies behindhand i ween at the bedecking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus the chosen party of seven sallied forth being accompanied to the edge of the wood by the whole band who gave them a merry parting and godspeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the journey to london town was made without incident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the party proceeded boldly along the kings highroad and no man met them who was disposed to say them nay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides the good queens warrant and ring would have answered for them as indeed it did at the gates of london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so on they sped and in due course came to the palace itself and awaited audience with the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the king had gone that day to finsbury field where the tourney was soon to be held in order to look over the lists and see some of his picked men whom he expected to win against all comers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so much had he boasted of these men that the queen had secretly resolved to win a wager of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had heard of the fame of robin hood and his yeomen as marian had said and marian on her part had been overjoyed to be able to add a word in their favor and to set out in search of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> today the queen sat in her private audienceroom chatting pleasantly with her ladies when in came mistress marian fitzwalter attired again as befitted her rank of ladyinwaiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she courtesied low to the queen and awaited permission to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the queen smiling is this my lady marian or the page richard partington <end> <end> 
<start> <start> richard found the man you sought while marian brought him to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> awaiting your audiencehe and four of his men likewise a lady of whose wooing and wedding i can tell you a pretty story at another time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so marian gave orders to a herald and presently robin hood and his little party entered the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the queen had halfexpected the men to be rude and uncouth in appearance because of their wild life in the forest but she was delightfully disappointed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed she started back in surprise and almost clapped her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for sooth to say the yeomen made a brave sight and in all the court no more gallant men could be found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marian felt her cheeks glow with pride at sight of the halfhidden looks of admiration sent forth by the other ladiesinwaiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robin had not forgot the gentle arts taught by his mother and he wore his fine red velvet tunic and breeches with the grace of a courtier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have seen before what a dandified gentleman will scarlet was and allanadale the minstrel was scarcely less goodly to look upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the giant little john and broadshouldered will stutely made up in stature what little they lacked in outward polish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mistress dale on her part looked even more charming if possible than on the momentous day when she went to plympton church to marry one man and found another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus came the people of the greenwood before queen eleanor in her own private audience room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and robin advanced and knelt down here i am robin hoodi and my chosen men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at your majestys bidding am i come bearing the ring of amnesty which i will protectas i would protect your majestys honorwith my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou art welcome lockesley said the queen smiling graciously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou art come in good time thou and all thy brave yeomanry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then robin presented each of his men in turn and each fell on his knee and was greeted with most kindly words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the queen kissed fair mistress dale upon the cheek and bade her remain in the palace with her ladies while she was in the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she made all the party be seated to rest themselves after their long journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fine wines were brought and cake and rich food for their refreshment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as they ate and drank the queen told them further of the tourney to be held at finsbury field and of how she desired them to wear her colors and shoot for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime she concluded they were to lie by quietly and be known of no man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to do all this robin and his men pledged themselves full heartily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then at the queens request they related to her and her ladies some of their merry adventures whereat the listeners were vastly entertained and laughed heartily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then marian who had heard of the wedding at plympton church told it so drolly that tears stood in the queens eyes from merriment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said twas indeed a comical business for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall keep that to twit his bones i promise you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will he not harp awhile for us today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allan bowed low and took a harp which was brought to him and he thrummed the strings and sang full sweetly the border songs of the north countree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the queen and all her ladies listened in rapt silence till all the songs were ended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king is into finsbury field marching in battle ray and after follows bold robin hood and all his yeomen gay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning of the great archery contest dawned fair and bright bringing with it a fever of impatience to every citizen of london town from the proudest courtier to the lowest kitchen wench <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole sky though lit by the sidereal rays seemed black by contrast with the whiteness of the waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conseil could not believe his eyes and questioned me as to the cause of this strange phenomenon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is called a milk sea i explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a large extent of white wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of amboyna and in these parts of the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but sir said conseil can you tell me what causes such an effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i suppose the water is not really turned into milk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no my boy and the whiteness which surprises you is caused only by the presence of myriads of infusoria a sort of luminous little worm gelatinous and without colour of the thickness of a hair and whose length is not more than seventhousandths of an inch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these insects adhere to one another sometimes for several leagues <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes my boy and you need not try to compute the number of these infusoria <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will not be able for if i am not mistaken ships have floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual colour but behind us even to the limits of the horizon the sky reflected the whitened waves and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague glimmerings of an aurora borealis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the th of february when at noon the nautilus came to the surface of the sea in n <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was land in sight about eight miles to westward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing i noticed was a range of mountains about two thousand feet high the shapes of which were most capricious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on taking the bearings i knew that we were nearing the island of ceylon the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the indian peninsula <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain nemo and his second appeared at this moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the island of ceylon noted for its pearlfisheries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you like to visit one of them m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though if we see the fisheries we shall not see the fishermen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never mind i will give orders to make for the gulf of manaar where we shall arrive in the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain said something to his second who immediately went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon the nautilus returned to her native element and the manometer showed that she was about thirty feet deep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir said captain nemo you and your companions shall visit the bank of manaar and if by chance some fisherman should be there we shall see him at work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i admit captain that i am not yet very familiar with that kind of fish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are accustomed to them replied captain nemo and in time you will be too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however we shall be armed and on the road we may be able to hunt some of the tribe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this said in a careless tone captain nemo left the saloon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if you were invited to hunt the bear in the mountains of switzerland what would you say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow we will go and hunt the bear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you were asked to hunt the lion in the plains of atlas or the tiger in the indian jungles what would you say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems we are going to hunt the tiger or the lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when you are invited to hunt the shark in its natural element you would perhaps reflect before accepting the invitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for myself i passed my hand over my forehead on which stood large drops of cold perspiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us reflect said i and take our time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hunting otters in submarine forests as we did in the island of crespo will pass but going up and down at the bottom of the sea where one is almost certain to meet sharks is quite another thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know well that in certain countries particularly in the andaman islands the negroes never hesitate to attack them with a dagger in one hand and a running noose in the other but i also know that few who affront those creatures ever return alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however i am not a negro and if i were i think a little hesitation in this case would not be illtimed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this moment conseil and the canadian entered quite composed and even joyous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith sir said ned land your captain nemothe devil take him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has just made us a very pleasant offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if agreeable to you sir interrupted conseil the commander of the nautilus has invited us to visit the magnificent ceylon fisheries tomorrow in your company he did it kindly and behaved like a real gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing more sir except that he had already spoken to you of this little walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir said conseil would you give us some details of the pearl fishery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to the fishing itself i asked or the incidents which <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the fishing replied the canadian before entering upon the ground it is as well to know something about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well sit down my friends and i will teach you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned and conseil seated themselves on an ottoman and the first thing sir what is a pearl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my worthy ned i answered to the poet a pearl is a tear of the sea to the orientals it is a drop of dew solidified to the ladies it is a jewel of an oblong shape of a brilliancy of motherofpearl substance which they wear on their fingers their necks or their ears for the chemist it is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of lime with a little gelatine and lastly for naturalists it is simply a morbid secretion of the organ that produces the motherofpearl amongst certain bivalves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> precisely so my learned conseil and amongst these testacea the earshell the tridacnae the turbots in a word all those which secrete motherofpearl that is the blue bluish violet or white substance which lines the interior of their shells are capable of producing pearls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes mussels of certain waters in scotland wales ireland saxony bohemia and france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the future i shall pay attention replied the canadian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i continued the particular mollusc which secretes the pearl is the pearloyster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pearl is nothing but a formation deposited in a globular form either adhering to the oystershell or buried in the folds of the creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the shell it is fast in the flesh it is loose but always has for a kernel a small hard substance maybe a barren egg maybe a grain of sand around which the pearly matter deposits itself year after year successively and by thin concentric layers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are many pearls found in the same oyster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one oyster has been mentioned though i allow myself to doubt it as having contained no less than a hundred and fifty sharks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meant to say a hundred and fifty pearls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly not said conseil but will you tell us now by what means they extract these pearls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they adhere to the shell the fishermen often pull them off with pincers but the most common way is to lay the oysters on mats of the seaweed which covers the banks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus they die in the open air and at the end of ten days they are in a forward state of decomposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are then plunged into large reservoirs of seawater then they are opened and washed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the price of these pearls varies according to their size <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only according to their size i answered but also according to their shape their water that is their colour and their lustre that is that bright and diapered sparkle which makes them so charming to the eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most beautiful are called virgin pearls or paragons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are formed alone in the tissue of the mollusc are white often opaque and sometimes have the transparency of an opal they are generally round or oval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the round are made into bracelets the oval into pendants and being more precious are sold singly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those adhering to the shell of the oyster are more irregular in shape and are sold by weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lastly in a lower order are classed those small pearls known under the name of seedpearls they are sold by measure and are especially used in embroidery for church ornaments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i answered quickly particularly if certain precautions are taken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what does one risk in such a calling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said ned land the swallowing of some mouthfuls of seawater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the bye said i trying to take captain nemos careless tone are you afraid of sharks brave ned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is my trade to make light of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon however as might be guessed was there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the eccentric man as he noted their advance over some rough ground are you really going to make this machine cross tinkle creek on a bridge of steel you carry with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little later after a successful test up and down a small gully tank a arrived at the edge of tinkle creek a small stream about twenty feet wide not far from toms home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the point selected for the test the banks were high and steep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she bridges that gap shell do anything murmured ned as the tank came to a stop on the edge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom cast a hasty glance over the mechanism of the machine before he started to cross the stream by the additional aid of the grippers or spanners as he sometimes called this latest device <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along each side in a row of sockets were two long girders of steel latticed like the main supports of a bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were of peculiar triangular construction designed to support heavy weights and each end was broadly flanged to prevent its sinking too deeply into the earth on either side of a gully or a stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grippers also had a sort of clawlike arrangement on either end working on the principle of an orangepeel shovel and these claws were designed to grip the earth to prevent slipping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spanners would be pulled out from their sockets on the side of the tank by means of steel cables which were operated from within <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would be run out across the gap and fastened in place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tank was designed to travel along them to the other side of the gap and once there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to pick tip the girders slip them back into place on the sides and the engine of war would travel on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i have not tried the grippers out except on a small model <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they worked there but whether they will work in practice remains to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course at this stage im willing to stake my all on the results <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there is always a halfquestion until the final tryout under practical conditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well well soon see said one of the workmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tank a as she was officially known had come to a stop as has been said on the very edge of tinkle creek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the banks were fairly solid here and descended precipitously to the water ten feet below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose the spanners break when youre halfway over tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont like to suppose anything of the sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that remains to be seen was the noncommittal reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> going up into the observation tower which was only slightly raised above the roof of the highest part of the tank tom gave the signal for the motors to start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a trembling throughout the whole of the vast structure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom threw back a lever and ned peering from a side observation slot beheld a strange sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the main arm of some great steam shovel two long latticed girders of steel shot out from the sides of the tank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gave a half turn as they were pulled forward by the steel ropes so that they lay with their broader surfaces uppermost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straight across the stream they were pulled their clawlike ends coming to a rest on the opposite bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they were tightened into place by a backward pull on the well so far so good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the topyes i hope answered tom with a laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called to the engine room through a telephone which could only be used when the machinery was not in action there being too much noise to permit the use of any but visual signals after that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course theres no real telling what will happen though i believe well come out of it alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the consubstantialists who by their success have deserved and obtained the title of catholics gloried in the simplicity and steadiness of their own creed and insulted the repeated variations of their adversaries who were destitute of any certain rule of faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sincerity or the cunning of the arian chiefs the fear of the laws or of the people their reverence for christ their hatred of athanasius all the causes human and divine that influence and disturb the counsels of a theological faction introduced among the sectaries a spirit of discord and inconstancy which in the course of a few years erected eighteen different models of religion and avenged the violated dignity of the church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the zealous hilary who from the peculiar hardships of his situation was inclined to extenuate rather than to aggravate the errors of the oriental clergy declares that in the wide extent of the ten provinces of asia to which he had been banished there could be found very few prelates who had preserved the knowledge of the true god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the oppression which he had felt the disorders of which he was the spectator and the victim appeased during a short interval the angry passions of his soul and in the following passage of which i shall transcribe a few lines the bishop of poitiers unwarily deviates into the style of a christian philosopher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a thing says hilary equally deplorable and dangerous that there are as many creeds as opinions among men as many doctrines as inclinations and as many sources of blasphemy as there are faults among us because we make creeds arbitrarily and explain them as arbitrarily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the homoousion is rejected and received and explained away by successive synods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the partial or total resemblance of the father and of the son is a subject of dispute for these unhappy times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every year nay every moon we make new creeds to describe invisible mysteries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we repent of what we have done we defend those who repent we anathematize those whom we defended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we condemn either the doctrine of others in ourselves or our own in that of others and reciprocally tearing one another to pieces we have been the cause of each others footnote athanasius in his epistle concerning the synods of seleucia and rimini tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has given an ample list of arian creeds which has been enlarged and improved by the labors of the indefatigable tillemont mem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> footnote erasmus with admirable sense and freedom has delineated the just character of hilary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to revise his text to compose the annals of his life and to justify his sentiments and footnote absque episcopo eleusio et paucis cum eo ex majore parte asianae decem provinciae inter quas consisto vere deum nesciunt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the celebrated parallel between atheism and superstition the bishop of poitiers would have been surprised in the philosophic society footnote hilarius ad constantium l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this remarkable passage deserved the attention of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into the model of his new commonplace book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will not be expected it would not perhaps be endured that i should swell this theological digression by a minute examination of the eighteen creeds the authors of which for the most part disclaimed the odious name of their parent arius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is amusing enough to delineate the form and to trace the vegetation of a singular plant but the tedious detail of leaves without flowers and of branches without fruit would soon exhaust the patience and disappoint the curiosity of the laborious student <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one question which gradually arose from the arian controversy may however be noticed as it served to produce and discriminate the three sects who were united only by their common aversion to the homoousion of the nicene synod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they were asked whether the son was like unto the father the question was resolutely answered in the negative by the heretics who adhered to the principles of arius or indeed to those of philosophy which seem to establish an infinite difference between the creator and the most excellent of his creatures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this obvious consequence was maintained by aetius on whom the zeal of his adversaries bestowed the surname of the atheist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his restless and aspiring spirit urged him to try almost every profession of human life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was successively a slave or at least a husbandman a travelling tinker a goldsmith a physician a schoolmaster a theologian and at last the apostle of a new church which was propagated by the abilities of his disciple eunomius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armed with texts of scripture and with captious syllogisms from the logic of aristotle the subtle aetius had acquired the fame of an invincible disputant whom it was impossible either to silence or to convince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such talents engaged the friendship of the arian bishops till they were forced to renounce and even to persecute a dangerous ally who by the accuracy of his reasoning had prejudiced their cause in the popular opinion and offended the piety of their most devoted followers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the omnipotence of the creator suggested a specious and respectful solution of the likeness of the father and the son and faith might humbly receive what reason could not presume to deny that the supreme god might communicate his infinite perfections and create a being similar only to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these arians were powerfully supported by the weight and abilities of their leaders who had succeeded to the management of the eusebian interest and who occupied the principal thrones of the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they detested perhaps with some affectation the impiety of aetius they professed to believe either without reserve or according to the scriptures that the son was different from all other creatures and similar only to the father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they denied the he was either of the same or of a similar substance sometimes boldly justifying their dissent and sometimes objecting to the use of the word substance which seems to imply an adequate or at least a distinct notion of the nature of the deity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sect which deserted the doctrine of a similar substance was the most numerous at least in the provinces of asia and when the leaders of both parties were assembled in the council of seleucia their opinion would have prevailed by a majority of one hundred and five to fortythree bishops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the greek word which was chosen to express this mysterious resemblance bears so close an affinity to the orthodox symbol that the profane of every age have derided the furious contests which the difference of a single diphthong excited between the homoousians and the homoiousians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it frequently happens that the sounds and characters which approach the nearest to each other accidentally represent the most opposite ideas the observation would be itself ridiculous if it were possible to mark any real and sensible distinction between the doctrine of the semiarians as they were improperly styled and that of the catholics themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bishop of poitiers who in his phrygian exile very wisely aimed at a coalition of parties endeavors to prove that by a pious and faithful interpretation the homoiousion may be reduced to a consubstantial sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet he confesses that the word has a dark and suspicious aspect and as if darkness were congenial to theological disputes the semiarians who advanced to the doors of the church assailed them with the most unrelenting fury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the character and adventures of aetius appear singular enough though they are carefully softened by the hand of a friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who was more attached to his principles than to his author has collected the odious circumstances which his footnote according to the judgment of a man who respected both these sectaries aetius had been endowed with a stronger understanding and eunomius had acquired more art and learning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the confession and apology of eunomius fabricius bibliot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is one of the few heretical pieces which have escaped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> footnote yet according to the opinion of estius and bull p <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is one power that of creation which god cannot communicate to a creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> estius who so accurately defined the limits of omnipotence was a dutchman by birth and by trade a scholastic divine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had copied the acts athanasius and hilary have explained the divisions of this arian synod the other circumstances which are relative to it are footnote fideli et pia intelligentia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his his short apologetical notes first published by the benedictines from a ms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of chartres he observes that he used this cautious expression qui intelligerum et impiam p <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philostorgius who saw those objects through a different medium is inclined to forget the difference of the important diphthong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the provinces of egypt and asia which cultivated the language and manners of the greeks had deeply imbibed the venom of the arian controversy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the familiar study of the platonic system a vain and argumentative disposition a copious and flexible idiom supplied the clergy and people of the east with an inexhaustible flow of words and distinctions and in the midst of their fierce contentions they easily forgot the doubt which is recommended by philosophy and the submission which is enjoined by religion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inhabitants of the west were of a less inquisitive spirit their passions were not so forcibly moved by invisible objects their minds were less frequently exercised by the habits of dispute and such was the happy ignorance of the gallican church that hilary himself above thirty years after the first general council was still a stranger to the nicene creed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latins had received the rays of divine knowledge through the dark and doubtful medium of a translation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poverty and stubbornness of their native tongue was not always capable of affording just equivalents for the greek terms for the technical words of the platonic philosophy which had been consecrated by the gospel or by the church to express the mysteries of the christian faith and a verbal defect might introduce into the latin theology a long train of error or perplexity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as the western provincials had the good fortune of deriving their religion from an orthodox source they preserved with steadiness the doctrine which they had accepted with docility and when the arian pestilence approached their frontiers they were supplied with the seasonable preservative of the homoousion by the paternal care of the roman pontiff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their sentiments and their temper were displayed in the memorable synod of rimini which surpassed in numbers the council of nice since it was composed of above four hundred bishops of italy africa spain gaul britain and illyricum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the first debates it appeared that only fourscore prelates adhered to the party though they affected to anathematize the name and memory of arius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this inferiority was compensated by the advantages of skill of experience and of discipline and the minority was conducted by valens and ursacius two bishops of illyricum who had spent their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils and who had been trained under the eusebian banner in the religious wars of the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by their arguments and negotiations they embarrassed they confounded they at last deceived the honest simplicity of the latin bishops who suffered the palladium of the faith to be extorted from their hand by fraud and importunity rather than by open violence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the council of rimini was not allowed to separate till the members had imprudently subscribed a captious creed in which some expressions susceptible of an heretical sense were inserted in the room of the homoousion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on this occasion that according to jerom the world was surprised to find itself arian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the bishops of the latin provinces had no sooner reached their respective dioceses than they discovered their mistake and repented of their weakness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ignominious capitulation was rejected with disdain and abhorrence and the homoousian standard which had been shaken but not overthrown was more footnote testor deumcoeli atque terrae me cum neutrum audissem semper tamen utrumque sensisse <end> <end>

<start> <start> the design of the latter is to apologize for the conduct of the latin bishops who were part iv <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such was the rise and progress and such were the natural revolutions of those theological disputes which disturbed the peace of christianity under the reigns of constantine and of his sons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as those princes presumed to extend their despotism over the faith as well as over the lives and fortunes of their subjects the weight of their suffrage sometimes inclined the ecclesiastical balance and the prerogatives of the king of heaven were settled or changed or modified in the cabinet of an earthly monarch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the unhappy spirit of discord which pervaded the provinces of the east interrupted the triumph of constantine but the emperor continued for some time to view with cool and careless indifference the object of the dispute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he was yet ignorant of the difficulty of appeasing the quarrels of theologians he addressed to the contending parties to alexander and to arius a moderating epistle which may be ascribed with far greater reason to the untutored sense of a soldier and statesman than to the dictates of any of his episcopal counsellors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he attributes the origin of the whole controversy to a trifling and subtle question concerning an incomprehensible point of law which was foolishly asked by the bishop and imprudently resolved by the presbyter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laments that the christian people who had the same god the same religion and the same worship should be divided by such inconsiderable distinctions and he seriously recommend to the clergy of alexandria the example of the greek philosophers who could maintain their arguments without losing their temper and assert their freedom without violating their friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the indifference and contempt of the sovereign would have been perhaps the most effectual method of silencing the dispute if the popular current had been less rapid and impetuous and if constantine himself in the midst of faction and fanaticism could have preserved the calm possession of his own mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his ecclesiastical ministers soon contrived to seduce the impartiality of the magistrate and to awaken the zeal of the proselyte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was provoked by the insults which had been offered to his statues he was alarmed by the real as well as the imaginary magnitude of the spreading mischief and he extinguished the hope of peace and toleration from the moment that he assembled three hundred bishops within the walls of the same palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the presence of the monarch swelled the importance of the debate his attention multiplied the arguments and he exposed his person with a patient intrepidity which animated the valor of the combatants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> notwithstanding the applause which has been bestowed on the eloquence and sagacity of constantine a roman general whose religion might be still a subject of doubt and whose mind had not been enlightened either by study or by inspiration was indifferently qualified to discuss in the greek language a metaphysical question or an article of faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the credit of his favorite osius who appears to have presided in the council of nice might dispose the emperor in favor of the orthodox party and a welltimed insinuation that the same eusebius of nicomedia who now protected the heretic had lately assisted the tyrant might exasperate him against their adversaries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nicene creed was ratified by constantine and his firm declaration that those who resisted the divine judgment of the synod must prepare themselves for an immediate exile annihilated the murmurs of a feeble opposition which from seventeen was almost instantly reduced to two protesting bishops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eusebius of caesarea yielded a reluctant and ambiguous consent to the homoousion and the wavering conduct of the nicomedian eusebius served only to delay about three months his disgrace and exile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the impious arius was banished into one of the remote provinces of illyricum his person and disciples were branded by law with the odious name of porphyrians his writings were condemned to the flames and a capital punishment was denounced against those in whose possession they should be found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the emperor had now imbibed the spirit of controversy and the angry sarcastic style of his edicts was designed to inspire his subjects with the hatred which he had conceived against the enemies of christ <end> <end>

<start> <start> the character of eusebius has always been a problem but those who have read the second critical epistle of le clerc ars critica tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> must entertain a very unfavorable opinion of the orthodoxy and sincerity of the bishop of caesarea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his circular letters which were addressed to the several cities constantine employed but as if the conduct of the emperor had been guided by passion instead of principle three years from the council of nice were scarcely elapsed before he discovered some symptoms of mercy and even of indulgence towards the proscribed sect which was secretly protected by his favorite sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the exiles were recalled and eusebius who gradually resumed his influence over the mind of constantine was restored to the episcopal throne from which he had been ignominiously degraded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arius himself was treated by the whole court with the respect which would have been due to an innocent and oppressed man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his faith was approved by the synod of jerusalem and the emperor seemed impatient to repair his injustice by issuing an absolute command that he should be solemnly admitted to the communion in the cathedral of constantinople <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the same day which had been fixed for the triumph of arius he expired and the strange and horrid circumstances of his death might excite a suspicion that the orthodox saints had contributed more efficaciously than by their prayers to deliver the church from the most formidable of her enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the three principal leaders of the catholics athanasius of alexandria eustathius of antioch and paul of constantinople were deposed on various f accusations by the sentence of numerous councils and were afterwards banished into distant provinces by the first of the christian emperors who in the last moments of his life received the rites of baptism from the arian bishop of nicomedia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ecclesiastical government of constantine cannot be justified from the reproach of levity and weakness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the credulous monarch unskilled in the stratagems of theological warfare might be deceived by the modest and specious professions of the heretics whose sentiments he never perfectly understood and while he protected arius and persecuted athanasius he still considered the council of nice as the bulwark of the christian faith and the peculiar glory of his own reign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> footnote we derive the original story from athanasius tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who expresses some reluctance to stigmatize the memory of the dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might exaggerate but the perpetual commerce of alexandria and constantinople would have rendered it dangerous to invent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who press the literal narrative of the death of arius his bowels suddenly burst out in a privy footnote the change in the sentiments or at least in the conduct of constantine may be traced in eusebius in vit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the first of these writers was too near the scene of action and the others were too remote from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is singular enough that the important task of continuing the history of the church should have been left for two laymen and a heretic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sons of constantine must have been admitted from their childhood into the rank of catechumens but they imitated in the delay of their baptism the example of their father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like him they presumed to pronounce their judgment on mysteries into which they had never been regularly initiated and the fate of the trinitarian controversy depended in a great measure on the sentiments of constantius who inherited the provinces of the east and acquired the possession of the whole empire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the arian presbyter or bishop who had secreted for his use the testament of the deceased emperor improved the fortunate occasion which had introduced him to the familiarity of a prince whose public counsels were always swayed by his domestic favorites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eunuchs and slaves diffused the spiritual poison through the palace and the dangerous infection was communicated by the female attendants to the guards and by the empress to her unsuspicious husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the partiality which constantius always expressed towards the eusebian faction was insensibly fortified by the dexterous management of their leaders and his victory over the tyrant magnentius increased his inclination as well as ability to employ the arms of power in the cause of arianism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the two armies were engaged in the plains of mursa and the fate of the two rivals depended on the chance of war the son of constantine passed the anxious moments in a church of the martyrs under the walls of the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his spiritual comforter valens the arian bishop of the diocese employed the most artful precautions to obtain such early intelligence as might secure either his favor or his escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a secret chain of swift and trusty messengers informed him of the vicissitudes of the battle and while the courtiers stood trembling round their affrighted master valens assured him that the gallic legions gave way and insinuated with some presence of mind that the glorious event had been revealed to him by an angel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grateful emperor ascribed his success to the merits and intercession of the bishop of mursa whose faith had deserved the public and miraculous approbation of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the arians who considered as their own the victory of constantius preferred his glory to that of his father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cyril bishop of jerusalem immediately composed the description of a celestial cross encircled with a splendid rainbow which during the festival of pentecost about the third hour of the day had appeared over the mount of olives to the edification of the devout pilgrims and the people of the holy city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the size of the meteor was gradually magnified and the arian historian has ventured to affirm that it was conspicuous to the two armies in the plains of pannonia and that the tyrant who is purposely represented as an idolater fled before the footnote quia etiam tum catechumenus sacramentum fidei merito videretiu potuisse nescire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he observes that the eunuchs are the natural enemies of the son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which ends with one of the first companions footnote sulpicius severus in hist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> expressly observes that in the reign of constantine the cross had been found in the bowels of the earth but that it had appeared in the reign of constantius in the midst of the heavens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this opposition evidently proves that cyril was ignorant of the stupendous miracle to which the conversion of constantine is attributed and this ignorance is the more surprising since it was no more than twelve years after his death that cyril was consecrated bishop of jerusalem by the immediate successor of eusebius of caesarea <end> <end>

<start> <start> they could not the sentiments of a judicious stranger who has impartially considered the progress of civil or ecclesiastical discord are always entitled to our notice and a short passage of ammianus who served in the armies and studied the character of constantius is perhaps of more value than many pages of theological invectives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the christian religion which in itself says that moderate historian is plain and simple he confounded by the dotage of superstition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of reconciling the parties by the weight of his authority he cherished and promulgated by verbal disputes the differences which his vain curiosity had excited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the highways were covered with troops of bishops galloping from every side to the assemblies which they call synods and while they labored to reduce the whole sect to their own particular opinions the public establishment of the posts was almost ruined by their hasty and repeated journeys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our more intimate knowledge of the ecclesiastical transactions of the reign of constantius would furnish an ample commentary on this remarkable passage which justifies the rational apprehensions of athanasius that the restless activity of the clergy who wandered round the empire in search of the true faith would excite the contempt and laughter of the unbelieving world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as the emperor was relieved from the terrors of the civil war he devoted the leisure of his winter quarters at arles milan sirmium and constantinople to the amusement or toils of controversy the sword of the magistrate and even of the tyrant was unsheathed to enforce the reasons of the theologian and as he opposed the orthodox faith of nice it is readily confessed that his incapacity and ignorance were equal to his presumption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eunuchs the women and the bishops who governed the vain and feeble mind of the emperor had inspired him with an insuperable dislike to the homoousion but his timid conscience was alarmed by the impiety of aetius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the guilt of that atheist was aggravated by the suspicious favor of the unfortunate gallus and even the death of the imperial ministers who had been massacred at antioch were imputed to the suggestions of that dangerous sophist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mind of constantius which could neither be moderated by reason nor fixed by faith was blindly impelled to either side of the dark and empty abyss by his horror of the opposite extreme he alternately embraced and condemned the sentiments he successively banished and recalled the leaders of the arian and semiarian factions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the season of public business or festivity he employed whole days and even nights in selecting the words and weighing the syllables which composed his fluctuating creeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the subject of his meditations still pursued and occupied his slumbers the incoherent dreams of the emperor were received as celestial visions and he accepted with complacency the lofty title of bishop of bishops from those ecclesiastics who forgot the interest of their order for the gratification of their passions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the design of establishing a uniformity of doctrine which had engaged him to convene so many synods in gaul italy illyricum and asia was repeatedly baffled by his own levity by the divisions of the arians and by the resistance of the catholics and he resolved as the last and decisive effort imperiously to dictate the decrees of a general council <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the destructive earthquake of nicomedia the difficulty of finding a convenient place and perhaps some secret motives of policy produced an alteration in the summons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bishops of the east were directed to meet at seleucia in isauria while those of the west held their deliberations at rimini on the coast of the hadriatic and instead of two or three deputies from each province the whole episcopal body was ordered to march <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eastern council after consuming four days in fierce and unavailing debate separated without any definitive conclusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the council of the west was protracted till the seventh month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taurus the praetorian praefect was instructed not to dismiss the prelates till they should all be united in the same opinion and his efforts were supported by the power of banishing fifteen of the most refractory and a promise of the consulship if he achieved so difficult an adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his prayers and threats the authority of the sovereign the sophistry of valens and ursacius the distress of cold and hunger and the tedious melancholy of a hopeless exile at length extorted the reluctant consent of the bishops of rimini <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deputies of the east and of the west attended the emperor in the palace of constantinople and he enjoyed the satisfaction of imposing on the world a profession of faith which established the likeness without expressing the consubstantiality of the son of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the triumph of arianism had been preceded by the removal of the orthodox clergy whom it was impossible either to intimidate or to corrupt and the reign of constantius was disgraced by the unjust and ineffectual persecution of the great athanasius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> footnote so curious a passage well deserves to be transcribed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have known eager opponents of democracy who allowed their children to address them with perfect colloquial equality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus at the same time that the power of aristocracy is declining the austere the conventional and the legal part of parental authority vanishes and a species of equality prevails around the domestic hearth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know not upon the whole whether society loses by the change but i am inclined to believe that man individually is a gainer by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think that in proportion as manners and laws become more democratic the relation of father and son becomes more intimate and more affectionate rules and authority are less talked of confidence and tenderness are oftentimes increased and it would seem that the natural bond is drawn closer in proportion as the social bond is loosened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a democratic family the father exercises no other power than that with which men love to invest the affection and the experience of age his orders would perhaps be disobeyed but his advice is for the most part authoritative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though he be not hedged in with ceremonial respect his sons at least accost him with confidence no settled form of speech is appropriated to the mode of addressing him but they speak to him constantly and are ready to consult him day by day the master and the constituted ruler have vanished the father remains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing more is needed in order to judge of the difference between the two states of society in this respect than to peruse the family correspondence of aristocratic ages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the style is always correct ceremonious stiff and so cold that the natural warmth of the heart can hardly be felt in the language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the language on the contrary addressed by a son to his father in democratic countries is always marked by mingled freedom familiarity and affection which at once show that new relations have sprung up in the bosom of the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a similar revolution takes place in the mutual relations of children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in aristocratic families as well as in aristocratic society every place is marked out beforehand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only does the father occupy a separate rank in which he enjoys extensive privileges but even the children are not equal amongst themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the age and sex of each irrevocably determine his rank and secure to him certain privileges most of these distinctions are abolished or diminished by democracy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in aristocratic families the eldest son inheriting the greater part of the property and almost all the rights of the family becomes the chief and to a certain extent the master of his brothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greatness and power are for him for them mediocrity and dependence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless it would be wrong to suppose that amongst aristocratic nations the privileges of the eldest son are advantageous to himself alone or that they excite nothing but envy and hatred in those around him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eldest son commonly endeavors to procure wealth and power for his brothers because the general splendor of the house is reflected back on him who represents it the younger sons seek to back the elder brother in all his undertakings because the greatness and power of the head of the family better enable him to provide for all its branches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the different members of an aristocratic family are therefore very closely bound together their interests are connected their minds agree but their hearts are seldom in harmony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> democracy also binds brothers to each other but by very different means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under democratic laws all the children are perfectly equal and consequently independent nothing brings them forcibly together but nothing keeps them apart and as they have the same origin as they are trained under the same roof as they are treated with the same care and as no peculiar privilege distinguishes or divides them the affectionate and youthful intimacy of early years easily springs up between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarcely any opportunities occur to break the tie thus formed at the outset of life for their brotherhood brings them daily together without embarrassing them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not then by interest but by common associations and by the free sympathy of opinion and of taste that democracy unites brothers to each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it divides their inheritance but it allows their hearts and minds to mingle together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such is the charm of these democratic manners that even the partisans of aristocracy are caught by it and after having experienced it for some time they are by no means tempted to revert to the respectful and frigid observance of aristocratic families <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would be glad to retain the domestic habits of democracy if they might throw off its social conditions and its laws but these elements are indissolubly united and it is impossible to enjoy the former without enduring the latter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the remarks i have made on filial love and fraternal affection are applicable to all the passions which emanate spontaneously from human nature itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a certain mode of thought or feeling is the result of some peculiar condition of life when that condition is altered nothing whatever remains of the thought or feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus a law may bind two members of the community very closely to one another but that law being abolished they stand asunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing was more strict than the tie which united the vassal to the lord under the feudal system at the present day the two men know not each other the fear the gratitude and the affection which formerly connected them have vanished and not a vestige of the tie remains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such however is not the case with those feelings which are natural to mankind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever a law attempts to tutor these feelings in any particular manner it seldom fails to weaken them by attempting to add to their intensity it robs them of some of their elements for they are never stronger than when left to themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> democracy which destroys or obscures almost all the old conventional rules of society and which prevents men from readily assenting to new ones entirely effaces most of the feelings to which these conventional rules have given rise but it only modifies some others and frequently imparts to them a degree of energy and sweetness unknown before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it is not impossible to condense into a single proposition the whole meaning of this chapter and of several others that preceded it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> democracy loosens social ties but it draws the ties of nature more tight it brings kindred more closely together whilst it places the various members of the community more widely apart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no free communities ever existed without morals and as i observed in the former part of this work morals are the work of woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> consequently whatever affects the condition of women their habits and their opinions has great political importance in my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amongst almost all protestant nations young women are far more the mistresses of their own actions than they are in catholic countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this independence is still greater in protestant countries like england which have retained or acquired the right of selfgovernment the spirit of freedom is then infused into the domestic circle by political habits and by religious opinions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the united states the doctrines of protestantism are combined with great political freedom and a most democratic state of society and nowhere are young women surrendered so early or so completely to their own guidance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long before an american girl arrives at the age of marriage her emancipation from maternal control begins she has scarcely ceased to be a child when she already thinks for herself speaks with freedom and acts on her own impulse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great scene of the world is constantly open to her view far from seeking concealment it is every day disclosed to her more completely and she is taught to survey it with a firm and calm gaze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus the vices and dangers of society are early revealed to her as she sees them clearly she views them without illusions and braves them without fear for she is full of reliance on her own strength and her reliance seems to be shared by all who are about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an american girl scarcely ever displays that virginal bloom in the midst of young desires or that innocent and ingenuous grace which usually attends the european woman in the transition from girlhood to youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is rarely that an american woman at any age displays childish timidity or ignorance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the young women of europe she seeks to please but she knows precisely the cost of pleasing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she does not abandon herself to evil at least she knows that it exists and she is remarkable rather for purity of manners than for chastity of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been frequently surprised and almost frightened at the singular address and happy boldness with which young women in america contrive to manage their thoughts and their language amidst all the difficulties of stimulating conversation a philosopher would have stumbled at every step along the narrow path which they trod without accidents and without effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is easy indeed to perceive that even amidst the independence of early youth an american woman is always mistress of herself she indulges in all permitted pleasures without yielding herself up to any of them and her reason never allows the reins of selfguidance to drop though it often seems to hold them loosely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in france where remnants of every age are still so strangely mingled in the opinions and tastes of the people women commonly receive a reserved retired and almost cloistral education as they did in aristocratic times and then they are suddenly abandoned without a guide and without assistance in the midst of all the irregularities inseparable from democratic society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have found out that in a democracy the independence of individuals cannot fail to be very great youth premature tastes illrestrained customs fleeting public opinion often unsettled and powerless paternal authority weak and marital authority contested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under these circumstances believing that they had little chance of repressing in woman the most vehement passions of the human heart they held that the surer way was to teach her the art of combating those passions for herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they could not prevent her virtue from being exposed to frequent danger they determined that she should know how best to defend it and more reliance was placed on the free vigor of her will than on safeguards which have been shaken or overthrown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead then of inculcating mistrust of herself they constantly seek to enhance their confidence in her own strength of character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it is neither possible nor desirable to keep a young woman in perpetual or complete ignorance they hasten to give her a precocious knowledge on all subjects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far from hiding the corruptions of the world from her they prefer that she should see them at once and train herself to shun them and they hold it of more importance to protect her conduct than to be overscrupulous of her innocence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although the americans are a very religious people they do not rely on religion alone to defend the virtue of woman they seek to arm her reason also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this they have followed the same method as in several other respects they first make the most vigorous efforts to bring individual independence to exercise a proper control over itself and they do not call in the aid of religion until they have reached the utmost limits of human strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am aware that an education of this kind is not without danger i am sensible that it tends to invigorate the judgment at the expense of the imagination and to make cold and virtuous women instead of affectionate wives and agreeable companions to man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> society may be more tranquil and better regulated but domestic life has often fewer charms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these however are secondary evils which may be braved for the sake of higher interests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the stage at which we are now arrived the time for choosing is no longer within our control a democratic education is indispensable to protect women from the dangers with which democratic institutions and manners surround them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in america the independence of woman is irrevocably lost in the bonds of matrimony if an unmarried woman is less constrained there than elsewhere a wife is subjected to stricter obligations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the former makes her fathers house an abode of freedom and of pleasure the latter lives in the home of her husband as if it were a cloister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet these two different conditions of life are perhaps not so contrary as may be supposed and it is natural that the american women should pass religious peoples and trading nations entertain peculiarly serious notions of marriage the former consider the regularity of womans life as the best pledge and most certain sign of the purity of her morals the latter regard it as the highest security for the order and prosperity of the household <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the americans are at the same time a puritanical people and a commercial nation their religious opinions as well as their trading habits consequently lead them to require much abnegation on the part of woman and a constant sacrifice of her pleasures to her duties which is seldom demanded of her in europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus in the united states the inexorable opinion of the public carefully circumscribes woman within the narrow circle of domestic interest and duties and forbids her to step beyond it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon her entrance into the world a young american woman finds these notions firmly established she sees the rules which are derived from them she is not slow to perceive that she cannot depart for an instant from the established usages of her contemporaries without putting in jeopardy her peace of mind her honor nay even her social existence and she finds the energy required for such an act of submission in the firmness of her understanding and in the virile habits which her education has given her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be said that she has learned by the use of her independence to surrender it without a struggle and without a murmur when the time comes for making the sacrifice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no american woman falls into the toils of matrimony as into a snare held out to her simplicity and ignorance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has been taught beforehand what is expected of her and voluntarily and freely does she enter upon this engagement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she supports her new condition with courage because she chose it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as in america paternal discipline is very relaxed and the conjugal tie very strict a young woman does not contract the latter without considerable circumspection and apprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus american women do not marry until their understandings are exercised and ripened whereas in other countries most women generally only begin to exercise and to ripen their understandings after marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i by no means suppose however that the great change which takes place in all the habits of women in the united states as soon as they are married ought solely to be attributed to the constraint of public opinion it is frequently imposed upon themselves by the sole effort of their own will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the time for choosing a husband is arrived that cold and stern reasoning power which has been educated and invigorated by the free observation of the world teaches an american woman that a spirit of levity and independence in the bonds of marriage is a constant subject of annoyance not of pleasure it tells her that the amusements of the girl cannot become the recreations of the wife and that the sources of a married womans happiness are in the home of her husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she clearly discerns beforehand the only road which can lead to domestic happiness she enters upon it at once and follows it to the end without seeking to turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt want to upset him the man said after a short silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has been worrying a long time about his lost son said bessie in a low apologetic tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes our landlord bessie faltered out catch ing hold of the iron railing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> commented young hagberd scornfully just the thing he would be proud of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you tell me whos that chap coming tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then up rose robin hood and shook friar tuck by the shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried he whereupon with much grunting the stout tuck got to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marry bestir thyself quoth robin for yonder in the church door is one of thy cloth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go thou and talk to him and so get thyself into the church that thou mayst be there when thou art wanted meantime little john will stutely and i will follow thee anon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so friar tuck clambered over the wall crossed the road and came to the church where the old friar was still laboring with the great key the lock being somewhat rusty and he somewhat old and feeble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilloa brother quoth tuck let me aid thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so saying he took the key from the others hand and quickly opened the door with a turn of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the old friar in a high wheezing voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whence comest thou and whither art thou going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he winked and blinked at stout friar tuck like an owl at the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus do i answer thy questions brother said the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my name is tuck and i go no farther than this spot if thou wilt haply but let me stay while this same wedding is going forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i come from fountain dale and in truth am a certain poor hermit as one may say for i live in a cell beside the fountain blessed by that holy saint ethelrada <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if i understand aught there is to be a gay wedding here today so if thou mindest not i would fain rest me in the cool shade within for i would like to see this fine sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> truly thou art welcome brother said the old man leading the way within <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime robin hood in his guise of harper together with little john and will stutely had come to the church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robin sat him down on a bench beside the door but little john carrying the two bags of gold went within as did will stutely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so robin sat by the door looking up the road and down the road to see who might come till after a time he saw six horsemen come riding sedately and slowly as became them for they were churchmen in high orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when they had come nearer robin saw who they were and knew them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first was the bishop of hereford and a fine figure he cut i wot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his vestments were of the richest silk and around his neck was a fair chain of beaten gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cap that hid his tonsure was of black velvet and around the edges of it were rows of jewels that flashed in the sunlight each stone being set in gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hose were of flamecolored silk and his shoes of black velvet the long pointed toes being turned up and fastened to his knees and on either instep was embroidered a cross in gold thread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside the bishop rode the prior of emmet upon a mincing palfrey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rich were his clothes also but not so gay as the stout bishops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind these were two of the higher brethren of emmet and behind these again two retainers belonging to the bishop for the lord bishop of hereford strove to be as like the great barons as was in the power of one in holy orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when robin saw this train drawing near with flash of jewels and silk and jingle of silver bells on the trappings of the nags he looked sourly upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quoth he to himself yon bishop is overgaudy for a holy man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do wonder whether his patron who methinks was saint thomas was given to wearing golden chains about his neck silk clothing upon his body and pointed shoes upon his feet the money for all of which god wot hath been wrung from the sweat of poor tenants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bishop bishop thy pride may have a fall ere thou wottest of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the holy men came to the church the bishop and the prior jesting and laughing between themselves about certain fair dames their words more befitting the lips of laymen methinks than holy clerks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they dismounted and the bishop looking around presently caught sight of robin standing in the doorway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilloa good fellow quoth he in a jovial voice who art thou that struttest in such gay feathers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a harper am i from the north country quoth robin and i can touch the strings i wot as never another man in all merry england can do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> truly good lord bishop many a knight and burgher clerk and layman have danced to my music willynilly and most times greatly against their will such is the magic of my harping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this day my lord bishop if i may play at this wedding i do promise that i will cause the fair bride to love the man she marries with a love that shall last as long as that twain shall live together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he looked keenly at robin who gazed boldly back again into his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if thou wilt cause this maiden who hath verily bewitched my poor cousin stephen thus to love the man she is to marry as thou sayst thou canst i will give thee whatsoever thou wilt ask me in due measure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me have a taste of thy skill fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay quoth robin my music cometh not without i choose even at a lord bishops bidding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in sooth i will not play until the bride and bridegroom come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now thou art a saucy varlet to speak so to my crest quoth the bishop frowning on robin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look prior hither cometh our cousin sir stephen and his ladylove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now around the bend of the highroad came others riding upon horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first of all was a tall thin man of knightly bearing dressed all in black silk with a black velvet cap upon his head turned up with scarlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robin looked and had no doubt that this was sir stephen both because of his knightly carriage and of his gray hairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside him rode a stout saxon franklin ellens father edward of deirwold behind those two came a litter borne by two horses and therein was a maiden whom robin knew must be ellen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind this litter rode six menatarms the sunlight flashing on their steel caps as they came jingling up the dusty road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so these also came to the church and there sir stephen leaped from his horse and coming to the litter handed fair ellen out therefrom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then robin hood looked at her and could wonder no longer how it came about that so proud a knight as sir stephen of trent wished to marry a common franklins daughter nor did he wonder that no ado was made about the matter for she was the fairest maiden that ever he had beheld <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now however she was all pale and drooping like a fair white lily snapped at the stem and so with bent head and sorrowful look she went within the church sir stephen leading her by the hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marry said robin calmly i will play in greater wise than your lordship thinks but not till the right time hath come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the bishop to himself while he looked grimly at robin when this wedding is gone by i will have this fellow well whipped for his saucy tongue and bold speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now fair ellen and sir stephen stood before the altar and the bishop himself came in his robes and opened his book whereat fair ellen looked up and about her in bitter despair like the fawn that finds the hounds on her haunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then in all his fluttering tags and ribbons of red and yellow robin hood strode forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three steps he took from the pillar whereby he leaned and stood between the bride and bridegroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me look upon this lass he said in a loud voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here be lilies in the cheeks and not roses such as befit a bonny bride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou sir knight so old and she so young and thou thinkest to make her thy wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell thee it may not be for thou art not her own true love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this all stood amazed and knew not where to look nor what to think or say for they were all bewildered with the happening so while everyone looked at robin as though they had been changed to stone he clapped his bugle horn to his lips and blew three blasts so loud and clear they echoed from floor to rafter as though they were sounded by the trump of doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then straightway little john and will stutely came leaping and stood upon either side of robin hood and quickly drew their broadswords the while a mighty voice rolled over the heads of all here be i good master when thou wantest me for it was friar tuck that so called from the organ loft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stout edward strode forward raging and would have seized his daughter to drag her away but little john stepped between and thrust him back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stand back old man said he thou art a hobbled horse this day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried sir stephen and felt for his sword but it hung not beside him on his wedding day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the menatarms drew their swords and it seemed like that blood would wet the stones but suddenly came a bustle at the door and loud voices steel flashed in the light and the crash of blows sounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the menatarms fell back and up the aisle came leaping eighteen stout yeomen all clad in lincoln green with allan a dale at their head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his hand he bore robin hoods good stout trusty bow of yew and this he gave to him kneeling the while upon one knee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then up spake edward of deirwold in a deep voice of anger is it thou allan a dale that hath bred all this coil in a church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay quoth merry robin that have i done and i care not who knoweth it for my name is robin hood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prior of emmet and those that belonged to him gathered together like a flock of frightened sheep when the scent of the wolf is nigh while the bishop of hereford laying aside his book crossed himself devoutly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now heaven keep us this day said he from that evil man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay quoth robin i mean you no harm but here is fair ellens betrothed husband and she shall marry him or pain will be bred to some of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then up spake stout edward in a loud and angry voice now i say nay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am her father and she shall marry sir stephen and none other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now all this time while everything was in turmoil about him sir stephen had been standing in proud and scornful silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay fellow said he coldly thou mayst take thy daughter back again i would not marry her after this days doings could i gain all merry england thereby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell thee plainly i loved thy daughter old as i am and would have taken her up like a jewel from the sty yet truly i knew not that she did love this fellow and was beloved by him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maiden if thou dost rather choose a beggarly minstrel than a highborn knight take thy choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do feel it shame that i should thus stand talking amid this herd and so i will leave you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus saying he turned and gathering his men about him walked proudly down the aisle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then all the yeomen were silenced by the scorn of his words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only friar tuck leaned over the edge of the choir loft and called out to him ere he had gone good den sir knight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou wottest old bones must alway make room for young blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir stephen neither answered nor looked up but passed out from the church as though he had heard nought his men following him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the coachman and a servant were replacing the wheel the lady and gentleman sheltered themselves beneath the mapletrees and there espied the bubbling fountain and david swan asleep beside it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> impressed with the awe which the humblest sleeped usually sheds around him the merchant trod as lightly as the gout would allow and his spouse took good heed not to rustle her silk gown lest david should start up all of a sudden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from what a depth he draws that easy breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such sleep as that brought on without an opiate would be worth more to me than half my income for it would suppose health and an untroubled mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> healthy and quiet age does not sleep thus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our slumber is no more like his than our wakefulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the longer they looked the more did this elderly couple feel interested in the unknown youth to whom the wayside and the maple shade were as a secret chamber with the rich gloom of damask curtains brooding over him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perceiving that a stray sunbeam glimmered down upon his face the lady contrived to twist a branch aside so as to intercept it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and having done this little act of kindness she began to feel like a mother to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> providence seems to have laid him here whispered she to her husband and to have brought us hither to find him after our disappointment in our cousins son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> methinks i can see a likeness to our departed henry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied his wife in the same hushed voice yet earnestly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while these whispers were passing the sleepers heart did not throb nor his breath become agitated nor his features betray the least token of interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet fortune was bending over him just ready to let fall a burden of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old merchant had lost his only son and had no heir to his wealth except a distant relative with whose conduct he was dissatisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in such cases people sometimes do stranger things than to act the magician and awaken a young man to splendor who fell asleep in poverty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coach is ready sir said the servant behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old couple started reddened and hurried away mutually wondering that they should ever have dreamed of doing anything so very ridiculous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the merchant threw himself back in the carriage and occupied his mind with the plan of a magnificent asylum for unfortunate men of business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the carriage could not have gone above a mile or two when a pretty young girl came along with a tripping pace which showed precisely how her little heart was dancing in her bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it was this merry kind of motion that causedis there any harm in saying it?her garter to slip its knot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conscious that the silken girthif silk it werewas relaxing its hold she turned aside into the shelter of the mapletrees and there found a young man asleep by the spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blushing as red as any rose that she should have intruded into a gentlemans bedchamber and for such a purpose too she was about to make her escape on tiptoe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a monster of a bee had been wandering overheadbuzz buzz buzznow among the leaves now flashing through the strips of sunshine and now lost in the dark shade till finally he appeared to be settling on the eyelid of david swan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sting of a bee is sometimes deadly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as free hearted as she was innocent the girl attacked the intruder with her handkerchief brushed him soundly and drove him from beneath the mapleshade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this good deed accomplished with quickened breath and a deeper blush she stole a glance at the youthful stranger for whom she had been battling with a dragon in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could it be that no dream of bliss grew so strong within him that shattered by its very strength it should part asunder and allow him to perceive the girl among its phantoms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why at least did no smile of welcome brighten upon his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was come the maid whose soul according to the old and beautiful idea had been severed from his own and whom in all his vague but passionate desires he yearned to meet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her only could he love with a perfect love him only could she receive into the depths of her heart and now her image was faintly blushing in the fountain by his side should it pass away its happy lustre would never gleam upon his life again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she departed but did not trip along the road so lightly as when she came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this girls father was a thriving country merchant in the neighborhood and happened at that identical time to be looking out for just such a young man as david swan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had david formed a wayside acquaintance with the daughter he would have become the fathers clerk and all else in natural succession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so here again had good fortunethe best of fortunesstolen so near that her garments brushed against him and he knew nothing of the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl was hardly out of sight when two men turned aside beneath the maple shade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both had dark faces set off by cloth caps which were drawn down aslant over their brows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their dresses were shabby yet had a certain smartness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were a couple of rascals who got their living by whatever the devil sent them and now in the interim of other business had staked the joint profits of their next piece of villany on a game of cards which was to have been decided here under the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but finding david asleep by the spring one of the rogues whispered to his fellowhist!do you see that bundle under his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill bet you a horn of brandy said the first that the chap has either a pocketbook or a snug little hoard of small change stowed away amongst his shirts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if not there we shall find it in his pantaloons pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his companion thrust aside his waistcoat pointed to the handle of a dirk and nodded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they approached the unconscious david and while one pointed the dagger towards his heart the other began to search the bundle beneath his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their two faces grim wrinkled and ghastly with guilt and fear bent over their victim looking horrible enough to be mistaken for fiends should he suddenly awake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay had the villains glanced aside into the spring even they would hardly have known themselves as reflected there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but david swan had never worn a more tranquil aspect even when asleep on his mothers breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must take away the bundle whispered one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he stirs ill strike muttered the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at this moment a dog scenting along the ground came in beneath the mapletrees and gazed alternately at each of these wicked men and then at the quiet sleeper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man with the dagger thrust back the weapon into his bosom and drew forth a pocket pistol but not of that kind which kills by a single discharge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a flask of liquor with a blocktin tumbler screwed upon the mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each drank a comfortable dram and left the spot with so many jests and such laughter at their unaccomplished wickedness that they might be said to have gone on their way rejoicing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few hours they had forgotten the whole affair nor once imagined that the recording angel had written down the crime of murder against their souls in letters as durable as eternity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i went i breakfasted on the dusty remnants of the ginger biscuits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew very little about the country and i hadnt a notion what i was going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i trusted to the strength of my legs but i was well aware that those behind me would be familiar with the lie of the land and that my ignorance would be a heavy handicap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw in front of me a sea of hills rising very high towards the south but northwards breaking down into broad ridges which separated wide and shallow dales <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ridge i had chosen seemed to sink after a mile or two to a moor which lay like a pocket in the uplands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that seemed as good a direction to take as any other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my stratagem had given me a fair start call it twenty minutes and i had the width of a glen behind me before i saw the first heads of the pursuers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the police had evidently called in local talent to their aid and the men i could see had the appearance of herds or gamekeepers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hallooed at the sight of me and i waved my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two dived into the glen and began to climb my ridge while the others kept their own side of the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt as if i were taking part in a schoolboy game of hare and hounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but very soon it began to seem less of a game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those fellows behind were hefty men on their native heath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking back i saw that only three were following direct and i guessed that the others had fetched a circuit to cut me off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lack of local knowledge might very well be my undoing and i resolved to get out of this tangle of glens to the pocket of moor i had seen from the tops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must so increase my distance as to get clear away from them and i believed i could do this if i could find the right ground for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there had been cover i would have tried a bit of stalking but on these bare slopes you could see a fly a mile off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my hope must be in the length of my legs and the soundness of my wind but i needed easier ground for that for i was not bred a mountaineer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how i longed for a good afrikander pony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put on a great spurt and got off my ridge and down into the moor before any figures appeared on the skyline behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i crossed a burn and came out on a highroad which made a pass between two glens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all in front of me was a big field of heather sloping up to a crest which was crowned with an odd feather of trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the dyke by the roadside was a gate from which a grass grown track led over the first wave of the moor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i jumped the dyke and followed it and after a few hundred yards as soon as it was out of sight of the highway the grass stopped and it became a very respectable road which was evidently kept with some care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clearly it ran to a house and i began to think of doing the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hitherto my luck had held and it might be that my best chance would be found in this remote dwelling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow there were trees there and that meant cover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not follow the road but the burnside which flanked it on the right where the bracken grew deep and the high banks made a tolerable screen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was well i did so for no sooner had i gained the hollow than looking back i saw the pursuit topping the ridge from which i had descended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that i did not look back i had no time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ran up the burnside crawling over the open places and for a large part wading in the shallow stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found a deserted cottage with a row of phantom peatstacks and an overgrown garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i was among young hay and very soon had come to the edge of a plantation of windblown firs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from there i saw the chimneys of the house smoking a few hundred yards to my left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forsook the burnside crossed another dyke and almost before i knew was on a rough lawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a glance back told me that i was well out of sight of the pursuit which had not yet passed the first lift of the moor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lawn was a very rough place cut with a scythe instead of a mower and planted with beds of scrubby rhododendrons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a brace of blackgame which are not usually garden birds rose at my approach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house before me was the ordinary moorland farm with a more pretentious whitewashed wing added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> attached to this wing was a glass veranda and through the glass i saw the face of an elderly gentleman meekly watching me <end> <end>

<start> <start> within was a pleasant room glass on one side and on the other a mass of books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the floor instead of tables stood cases such as you see in a museum filled with coins and queer stone implements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said it was the sort of thing i had often longed for myself and we discussed the possibility of our going away we four to some handy wellfitted desert island and living there in the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harris said that the danger about desert islands as far as he had heard was that they were so damp but george said no not if properly drained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then we got on to drains and that put george in mind of a very funny thing that happened to his father once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said his father was travelling with another fellow through wales and one night they stopped at a little inn where there were some other fellows and they joined the other fellows and spent the evening with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had a very jolly evening and sat up late and by the time they came to go to bed they this was when georges father was a very young man were slightly jolly too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they georges father and georges fathers friend were to sleep in the same room but in different beds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the candle lurched up against the wall when they got into the room and went out and they had to undress and grope into bed in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this they did but instead of getting into separate beds as they thought they were doing they both climbed into the same one without knowing it one getting in with his head at the top and the other crawling in from the opposite side of the compass and lying with his feet on the pillow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied joes voice from the other end of the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why theres a man in my bed said georges father heres his feet on my pillow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its an extraordinary thing tom answered the other but im blest if there isnt a man in my bed too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well im going to chuck him out replied joe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a brief struggle followed by two heavy bumps on the floor and i say tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well to tell you the truth my mans chucked me out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say i dont think much of this inn do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah no then it isnt the same replied harris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why its so curious murmured harris but precisely that very same thing happened to my father once at a country inn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it might have been the same inn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we turned in at ten that night and i thought i should sleep well being tired but i didnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a rule i undress and put my head on the pillow and then somebody bangs at the door and says it is halfpast eight but tonight everything seemed against me the novelty of it all the hardness of the boat the cramped position i was lying with my feet under one seat and my head on another the sound of the lapping water round the boat and the wind among the branches kept me restless and disturbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did get to sleep for a few hours and then some part of the boat which seemed to have grown up in the night for it certainly was not there when we started and it had disappeared by the morning kept digging into my spine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i slept through it for a while dreaming that i had swallowed a sovereign and that they were cutting a hole in my back with a gimlet so as to try and get it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it very unkind of them and i told them i would owe them the money and they should have it at the end of the month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they would not hear of that and said it would be much better if they had it then because otherwise the interest would accumulate so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got quite cross with them after a bit and told them what i thought of them and then they gave the gimlet such an excruciating wrench that i woke up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boat seemed stuffy and my head ached so i thought i would step out into the cool nightair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i slipped on what clothes i could find about some of my own and some of georges and harriss and crept under the canvas on to the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon had sunk and left the quiet earth alone with the stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed as if in the silence and the hush while we her children slept they were talking with her their sister conversing of mighty mysteries in voices too vast and deep for childish human ears to catch the sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they awe us these strange stars so cold so clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are as children whose small feet have strayed into some dimlit temple of the god they have been taught to worship but know not and standing where the echoing dome spans the long vista of the shadowy light glance up half hoping half afraid to see some awful vision hovering there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet it seems so full of comfort and of strength the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in its great presence our small sorrows creep away ashamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day has been so full of fret and care and our hearts have been so full of evil and of bitter thoughts and the world has seemed so hard and wrong to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then night like some great loving mother gently lays her hand upon our fevered head and turns our little tearstained faces up to hers and smiles and though she does not speak we know what she would say and lay our hot flushed cheek against her bosom and the pain is gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes our pain is very deep and real and we stand before her very silent because there is no language for our pain only a moan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nights heart is full of pity for us she cannot ease our aching she takes our hand in hers and the little world grows very small and very far away beneath us and borne on her dark wings we pass for a moment into a mightier presence than her own and in the wondrous light of that great presence all human life lies like a book before us and we know that pain and sorrow are but the angels of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only those who have worn the crown of suffering can look upon that wondrous light and they when they return may not speak of it or tell the mystery they know <end> <end>

<start> <start> the descendants of arsaces were degraded from the royal dignity which they had possessed above five hundred and sixty years and the dominions of the unfortunate artasires under the new and significant appellation of persarmenia were reduced into the form of a province <end> <end>

<start> <start> but her resistance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials nor did placidia refuse to become the mother of honoria and valentinian the third or to assume and exercise an absolute dominion over the mind of her grateful husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the generous soldier whose time had hitherto been divided between social pleasure and military service was taught new lessons of avarice and ambition he extorted the title of augustus and the servant of honorius was associated to the empire of the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the death of constantius in the seventh month of his reign instead of diminishing seemed to inerease the power of placidia and the indecent familiarity of her brother which might be no more than the symptoms of a childish affection were universally attributed to incestuous love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a sudden by some base intrigues of a steward and a nurse this excessive fondness was converted into an irreconcilable quarrel the debates of the emperor and his sister were not long confined within the walls of the palace and as the gothic soldiers adhered to their queen the city of ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous tumults which could only be appeased by the forced or voluntary retreat of placidia and her children <end> <end>

<start> <start> in such a cause the grandson of the great theodosius should have marched in person but the young emperor was easily diverted by his physicians from so rash and hazardous a design and the conduct of the italian expedition was prudently intrusted to ardaburius and his son aspar who had already signalized their valor against the persians <end> <end>

<start> <start> yet this incident unfortunate as it might seem facilitated the conquest of italy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ardaburius employed or abused the courteous freedom which he was permitted to enjoy to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and gratitude and as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution he invited by private messages and pressed the approach of aspar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a shepherd whom the popular credulity transformed into an angel guided the eastern cavalry by a secret and it was thought an impassable road through the morasses of the po the gates of ravenna after a short struggle were thrown open and the defenceless tyrant was delivered to the mercy or rather to the cruelty of the conquerors <end> <end>

<start> <start> and in a monarchy which according to various precedents might be considered as elective or hereditary or patrimonial it was impossible that the intricate claims of female and collateral succession should be clearly defined and theodosius by the right of consanguinity or conquest might have reigned the sole legitimate emperor of the romans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment perhaps his eyes were dazzled by the prospect of unbounded sway but his indolent temper gradually acquiesced in the dictates of sound policy <end> <end>

<start> <start> instead of listening to the voice of ambition theodosius resolved to imitate the moderation of his grandfather and to seat his cousin valentinian on the throne of the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the royal infant was distinguished at constantinople by the title of nobilissimus he was promoted before his departure from thessalonica to the rank and dignity of caesar and after the conquest of italy the patrician helion by the authority of theodosius and in the presence of the senate saluted valentinian the third by the name of augustus and solemnly invested him with the diadem and the imperial purple <end> <end>

<start> <start> the mother of valentinian was jealous of the power which she was incapable of exercising she reigned twentyfive years in the name of her son and the character of that unworthy emperor gradually countenanced the suspicion that placidia had enervated his youth by a dissolute education and studiously diverted his attention from every manly and honorable pursuit <end> <end>

<start> <start> the abilities of aetius and boniface might have been usefully employed against the public enemies in separate and important commands but the experience of their past conduct should have decided the real favor and confidence of the empress placidia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the melancholy season of her exile and distress boniface alone had maintained her cause with unshaken fidelity and the troops and treasures of africa had essentially contributed to extinguish the rebellion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same rebellion had been supported by the zeal and activity of aetius who brought an army of sixty thousand huns from the danube to the confines of italy for the service of the usurper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the untimely death of john compelled him to accept an advantageous treaty but he still continued the subject and the soldier of valentinian to entertain a secret perhaps a treasonable correspondence with his barbarian allies whose retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts and more liberal promises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but aetius possessed an advantage of singular moment in a female reign he was present he besieged with artful and assiduous flattery the palace of ravenna disguised his dark designs with the mask of loyalty and friendship and at length deceived both his mistress and his absent rival by a subtle conspiracy which a weak woman and a brave man could not easily suspect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had secretly persuaded placidia to recall boniface from the government of africa he secretly advised boniface to disobey the imperial summons to the one he represented the order as a sentence of death to the other he stated the refusal as a signal of revolt and when the credulous and unsuspectful count had armed the province in his defence aetius applauded his sagacity in foreseeing the rebellion which his own perfidy had excited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a temperate inquiry into the real motives of boniface would have restored a faithful servant to his duty and to the republic but the arts of aetius still continued to betray and to inflame and the count was urged by persecution to embrace the most desperate counsels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the success with which he eluded or repelled the first attacks could not inspire a vain confidence that at the head of some loose disorderly africans he should be able to withstand the regular forces of the west commanded by a rival whose military character it was impossible for him to despise <end> <end>

<start> <start> to define the ambiguities to circumscribe the latitude to apply the principles to extend the consequences to reconcile the real or apparent contradictions was a much nobler and more important task and the province of legislation was silently invaded by the expounders of ancient statutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their subtle interpretations concurred with the equity of the praetor to reform the tyranny of the darker ages however strange or intricate the means it was the aim of artificial jurisprudence to restore the simple dictates of nature and reason and the skill of private citizens was usefully employed to undermine the public institutions of their country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the revolution of almost one thousand years from the twelve tables to the reign of justinian may be divided into three periods almost equal in duration and distinguished from each other by the mode of instruction and the character of the civilians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pride and ignorance contributed during the first period to confine within narrow limits the science of the roman law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the public days of market or assembly the masters of the art were seen walking in the forum ready to impart the needful advice to the meanest of their fellowcitizens from whose votes on a future occasion they might solicit a grateful return <end> <end>

<start> <start> the youths of their own order and family were permitted to listen their children enjoyed the benefit of more private lessons and the mucian race was long renowned for the hereditary knowledge of the civil law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second period the learned and splendid age of jurisprudence may be extended from the birth of cicero to the reign of severus alexander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a system was formed schools were instituted books were composed and both the living and the dead became subservient to the instruction of the student <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tripartite of aelius paetus surnamed catus or the cunning was preserved as the oldest work of jurisprudence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cato the censor derived some additional fame from his legal studies and those of his son the kindred appellation of mucius scaevola was illustrated by three sages of the law but the perfection of the science was ascribed to servius sulpicius their disciple and the friend of tully and the long succession which shone with equal lustre under the republic and under the caesars is finally closed by the respectable characters of papinian of paul and of ulpian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their names and the various titles of their productions have been minutely preserved and the example of labeo may suggest some idea of their diligence and fecundity <end> <end>

<start> <start> in the third period between the reigns of alexander and justinian the oracles of jurisprudence were almost mute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the measure of curiosity had been filled the throne was occupied by tyrants and barbarians the active spirits were diverted by religious disputes and the professors of rome constantinople and berytus were humbly content to repeat the lessons of their more enlightened predecessors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the slow advances and rapid decay of these legal studies it may be inferred that they require a state of peace and refinement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the multitude of voluminous civilians who fill the intermediate space it is evident that such studies may be pursued and such works may be performed with a common share of judgment experience and industry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the genius of cicero and virgil was more sensibly felt as each revolving age had been found incapable of producing a similar or a second but the most eminent teachers of the law were assured of leaving disciples equal or superior to themselves in merit and reputation <end> <end>

<start> <start> the scaevolas had been taught by use and experience but servius sulpicius was the first civilian who established his art on a certain and general theory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the discernment of truth and falsehood he applied as an infallible rule the logic of aristotle and the stoics reduced particular cases to general principles and diffused over the shapeless mass the light of order and eloquence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cicero his contemporary and friend declined the reputation of a professed lawyer but the jurisprudence of his country was adorned by his incomparable genius which converts into gold every object that it touches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the example of plato he composed a republic and for the use of his republic a treatise of laws in which he labors to deduce from a celestial origin the wisdom and justice of the roman constitution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole universe according to his sublime hypothesis forms one immense commonwealth gods and men who participate of the same essence are members of the same community reason prescribes the law of nature and nations and all positive institutions however modified by accident or custom are drawn from the rule of right which the deity has inscribed on every virtuous mind <end> <end>

<start> <start> of these the armor of the stoics was found to be of the firmest temper and it was chiefly worn both for use and ornament in the schools of jurisprudence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the portico the roman civilians learned to live to reason and to die but they imbibed in some degree the prejudices of the sect the love of paradox the pertinacious habits of dispute and a minute attachment to words and verbal distinctions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the superiority of form to matter was introduced to ascertain the right of property and the equality of crimes is countenanced by an opinion of trebatius that he who touches the ear touches the whole body and that he who steals from a heap of corn or a hogshead footnote m <end> <end>

<start> <start> in the composition of the edict a learned praetor gave a sanction and preference to his private sentiments the opinion of a censor or a counsel was entertained with respect and a doubtful interpretation of the laws might be supported by the virtues or triumphs of the civilian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the patrician arts were long protected by the veil of mystery and in more enlightened times the freedom of inquiry established the general principles of jurisprudence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> subtile and intricate cases were elucidated by the disputes of the forum rules axioms and definitions were admitted as the genuine dictates of reason and the consent of the legal professors was interwoven into the practice of the tribunals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but these interpreters could neither enact nor execute the laws of the republic and the judges might disregard the authority of the scaevolas themselves which was often overthrown by the eloquence or sophistry of an ingenious pleader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> augustus and tiberius were the first to adopt as a useful engine the science of the civilians and their servile labors accommodated the old system to the spirit and views of despotism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under the fair pretence of securing the dignity of the art the privilege of subscribing legal and valid opinions was confined to the sages of senatorian or equestrian rank who had been previously approved by the judgment of the prince and this monopoly prevailed till adrian restored the freedom of the profession to every citizen conscious of his abilities and knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the discretion of the praetor was now governed by the lessons of his teachers the judges were enjoined to obey the comment as well as the text of the law and the use of codicils was a memorable innovation which augustus ratified by the advice footnote we have heard of the catonian rule the aquilian stipulation and the manilian forms of maxims and of footnote see pomponius de origine juris pandect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet the monopoly of augustus a harsh measure would appear with some softening in contemporary evidence and it was probably veiled by a decree of the senate footnote the author here follows the then generally received opinion of heineccius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the proofs which appear to confirm it are l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first of these passages speaks expressly of a privilege granted to certain lawyers until the time of adrian publice respondendi jus ante augusti tempora non dabatur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> primus divus augustus ut major juris auctoritas haberetur constituit ut ex auctoritate ejus responderent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passage of the institutes speaks of the different opinions of those quibus est permissum jura condere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true that the first of these passages does not say that the opinion of these privileged lawyers had the force of a law for the judges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hugo altogether rejects the opinion adopted by heineccius by bach and in general by all the writers who preceded him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he conceives that the of the institutes referred to the constitution of valentinian iii <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which regulated the respective authority to be ascribed to the different writings of the great civilians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we have now the following passage in the institutes of gaius responsa prudentum sunt sententiae et opiniones eorum quibus permissum est jura condere quorum omnium si in unum sententiae concorrupt id quod ita sentiunt legis vicem obtinet si vero dissentiunt judici licet quam velit sententiam sequi idque rescripto divi hadrian signiticatur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know how in opposition to this passage the opinion of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must add to this the passage quoted from pomponius and from such strong proofs it seems incontestable that the emperors had granted some kind of privilege to certain civilians quibus permissum erat jura condere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their opinion had sometimes the force of law legis vicem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hugo endeavoring to reconcile this phrase with his system gives it a forced interpretation which quite alters the sense he supposes that the passage contains no more than what is evident of itself that the authority of the civilians was to be respected thus making a privilege of that which was free to all the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appears to me almost indisputable that the emperors had sanctioned certain provisions relative to the authority of these civilians consulted by the judges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how far was their advice to be respected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a question which it is impossible to answer precisely from the want of historic evidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it not possible that the emperors established an authority to be consulted by the judges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in this case this authority must have emanated from certain civilians named for this purpose by the emperors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover may not the passage of suetonius in the life of caligula where he says that the emperor would no longer permit the civilians to give their advice mean that caligula entertained the design of suppressing this institution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our author not being acquainted with the opinions opposed to heineccius has not gone to the bottom of the the most absolute mandate could only require that the judges should agree with the civilians if the civilians agreed among themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but positive institutions are often the result of custom and prejudice laws and language are ambiguous and arbitrary where reason is incapable of pronouncing the love of argument is inflamed by the envy of rivals the vanity of masters the blind attachment of their disciples and the roman jurisprudence was divided by the once famous sects of the proculians and sabinians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two sages of the law ateius capito and antistius labeo adorned the peace of the augustan age the former distinguished by the favor of his sovereign the latter more illustrious by his contempt of that favor and his stern though harmless opposition to the tyrant of rome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their legal studies were influenced by the various colors of their temper and principles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> labeo was attached to the form of the old republic his rival embraced the more profitable substance of the rising monarchy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the disposition of a courtier is tame and submissive and capito seldom presumed to deviate from the sentiments or at least from the words of his predecessors while the bold republican pursued his independent ideas without fear of paradox or innovations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the freedom of labeo was enslaved however by the rigor of his own conclusions and he decided according to the letter of the law the same questions which his indulgent competitor resolved with a latitude of equity more suitable to the common sense and feelings of mankind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a fair exchange had been substituted to the payment of money capito still considered the transaction as a legal sale and he consulted nature for the age of puberty without confining his definition to the precise period of twelve or fourteen years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this opposition of sentiments was propagated in the writings and lessons of the two founders the schools of capito and labeo maintained their inveterate conflict from the age of augustus to that of adrian and the two sects derived their appellations from sabinus and proculus their most celebrated teachers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the names of cassians and pegasians were likewise applied to the same parties but by a strange reverse the popular cause was in the hands of pegasus a timid slave of domitian while the favorite of the caesars was represented by cassius who gloried in his descent from the patriot assassin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the perpetual edict the controversies of the sects were in a great measure determined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for that important work the emperor adrian preferred the chief of the sabinians the friends of monarchy prevailed but the moderation of salvius julian insensibly reconciled the victors and the vanquished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the contemporary philosophers the lawyers of the age of the antonines disclaimed the authority of a master and adopted from every system the most probable doctrines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but their writings would have been less voluminous had their choice been more unanimous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conscience of the judge was perplexed by the number and weight of discordant testimonies and every sentence that his passion or interest might pronounce was justified by the sanction of some venerable name <end> <end>

<start> <start> in the libraries of the arabians as in those of europe the far greater part of the innumerable volumes were possessed only of local value or imaginary merit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shelves were crowded with orators and poets whose style was adapted to the taste and manners of their countrymen with general and partial histories which each revolving generation supplied with a new harvest of persons and events with codes and commentaries of jurisprudence which derived their authority from the law of the prophet with the interpreters of the koran and orthodox tradition and with the whole theological tribe polemics mystics scholastics and moralists the first or the last of writers according to the different estimates of sceptics or believers <end> <end>

<start> <start> among the ideal systems which have varied with the fashion of the times the arabians adopted the philosophy of the stagirite alike intelligible or alike obscure for the readers of every age <end> <end>

<start> <start> the metaphysics of infinite or finite spirit have too often been enlisted in the service of superstition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the human faculties are fortified by the art and practice of dialectics the ten predicaments of aristotle collect and methodize our ideas and his syllogism is the keenest weapon of dispute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was dexterously wielded in the schools of the saracens but as it is more effectual for the detection of error than for the investigation of truth it is not surprising that new generations of masters and disciples should still revolve in the same circle of logical argument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mathematics are distinguished by a peculiar privilege that in the course of ages they may always advance and can never recede <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the ancient geometry if i am not misinformed was resumed in the same state by the italians of the fifteenth century and whatever may be the origin of the name the science of algebra is ascribed to the grecian diophantus by the modest testimony of the arabs themselves <end> <end>

<start> <start> the success of each professor must have been influenced by personal and accidental causes but we may form a less fanciful estimate of their general knowledge of anatomy botany and chemistry the threefold basis of their theory and practice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a superstitious reverence for the dead confined both the greeks and the arabians to the dissection of apes and quadrupeds the more solid and visible parts were known in the time of galen and the finer scrutiny of the human frame was reserved for the microscope and the injections of modern artists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> botany is an active science and the discoveries of the torrid zone might enrich the herbal of dioscorides with two thousand plants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some traditionary knowledge might be secreted in the temples and monasteries of egypt much useful experience had been acquired in the practice of arts and manufactures but the science of chemistry owes its origin and improvement to the industry of the saracens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they first invented and named the alembic for the purposes of distillation analyzed the substances of the three kingdoms of nature tried the distinction and affinities of alcalis and acids and converted the poisonous minerals into soft and salutary medicines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the most eager search of arabian chemistry was the transmutation of metals and the elixir of immortal health the reason and the fortunes of thousands were evaporated in the crucibles of alchemy and the consummation of the great work was promoted by the worthy aid of mystery fable and superstition <end> <end>

<start> <start> with the consent or connivance of their sovereign her ministers subscribed an ignominious peace and the exchange of some royal gifts could not disguise the annual tribute of seventy thousand dinars of gold which was imposed on the roman empire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the saracens had too rashly advanced into the midst of a distant and hostile land their retreat was solicited by the promise of faithful guides and plentiful markets and not a greek had courage to whisper that their weary forces might be surrounded and destroyed in their necessary passage between a slippery mountain and the river sangarius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five years after this expedition harun ascended the throne of his father and his elder brother the most powerful and vigorous monarch of his race illustrious in the west as the ally of charlemagne and familiar to the most childish readers as the perpetual hero of the arabian tales <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his title to the name of al rashid the just is sullied by the extirpation of the generous perhaps the innocent barmecides yet he could listen to the complaint of a poor widow who had been pillaged by his troops and who dared in a passage of the koran to threaten the inattentive despot with the judgment of god and posterity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his court was adorned with luxury and science but in a reign of threeandtwenty years harun repeatedly visited his provinces from chorasan to egypt nine times he performed the pilgrimage of mecca eight times he invaded the territories of the romans and as often as they declined the payment of the tribute they were taught to feel that a month of depredation was more costly than a year of submission <end> <end>

<start> <start> at these words the ambassadors cast a bundle of swords before the foot of the throne <end> <end>

<start> <start> the triumphant caliph retired after the fatigues of the campaign to his favorite palace of racca on the euphrates but the distance of five hundred miles and the inclemency of the season encouraged his adversary to violate the peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicephorus was astonished by the bold and rapid march of the commander of the faithful who repassed in the depth of winter the snows of mount taurus his stratagems of policy and war were exhausted and the perfidious greek escaped with three wounds from a field of battle overspread with forty thousand of his subjects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet the emperor was ashamed of submission and the caliph was resolved on victory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one hundred and thirtyfive thousand regular soldiers received pay and were inscribed in the military roll and above three hundred thousand persons of every denomination marched under the black standard of the abbassides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they swept the surface of asia minor far beyond tyana and ancyra and invested the pontic heraclea once a flourishing state now a paltry town at that time capable of sustaining in her antique walls a months siege against the forces of the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ruin was complete the spoil was ample but if harun had been conversant with grecian story he would have regretted the statue of hercules whose attributes the club the bow the quiver and the lions hide were sculptured in massy gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the progress of desolation by sea and land from the euxine to the isle of cyprus compelled the emperor nicephorus to retract his haughty defiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the new treaty the ruins of heraclea were left forever as a lesson and a trophy and the coin of the tribute was marked with the image and superscription of harun and his three sons <end> <end>

<start> <start> i am satisfied that sherefeddin ali has faithfully described the first ostentatious interview in which the conqueror whose spirits were harmonized by success affected the character of generosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his mind was insensibly alienated by the unseasonable arrogance of bajazet the complaints of his enemies the anatolian princes were just and vehement and timour betrayed a design of leading his royal captive in triumph to samarcand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an attempt to facilitate his escape by digging a mine under the tent provoked the mogul emperor to impose a harsher restraint and in his perpetual marches an iron cage on a wagon might be invented not as a wanton insult but as a rigorous precaution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> timour had read in some fabulous history a similar treatment of one of his predecessors a king of persia and bajazet was condemned to represent the person and expiate the guilt of the roman caesar but the strength of his mind and body fainted under the trial and his premature death might without injustice be ascribed to the severity of timour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he warred not with the dead a tear and a sepulchre were all that he could bestow on a captive who was delivered from his power and if mousa the son of bajazet was permitted to reign over the ruins of boursa the greatest part of the province of anatolia had been restored by the conqueror to their lawful sovereigns <end> <end>

<start> <start> it originates in a mistake in the meaning of the turkish word kafe which means a covered litter or palanquin drawn by two horses and is generally used to convey the harem of an eastern monarch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in such a litter with the latticework made of iron bajazet either chose or was constrained to travel <end> <end>

<start> <start> the european schiltberger the two oldest of the turkish historians and the most valuable of the later compilers seadeddin describe this litter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seadeddin discusses the question with some degree of historical criticism and ascribes the choice of such a vehicle to the indignant state of bajazets mind which would not brook from the irtish and volga to the persian gulf and from the ganges to damascus and the archipelago asia was in the hand of timour his armies were invincible his ambition was boundless and his zeal might aspire to conquer and convert the christian kingdoms of the west which already trembled at his name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he touched the utmost verge of the land but an insuperable though narrow sea rolled between the two continents of europe and asia and the lord of so many tomans or myriads of horse was not master of a single galley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two passages of the bosphorus and hellespont of constantinople and gallipoli were possessed the one by the christians the other by the turks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this great occasion they forgot the difference of religion to act with union and firmness in the common cause the double straits were guarded with ships and fortifications and they separately withheld the transports which timour demanded of either nation under the pretence of attacking their enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time they soothed his pride with tributary gifts and suppliant embassies and prudently tempted him to retreat with the honors of victory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soliman the son of bajazet implored his clemency for his father and himself accepted by a red patent the investiture of the kingdom of romania which he already held by the sword and reiterated his ardent wish of casting himself in person at the feet of the king of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the greek emperor either john or manuel submitted to pay the same tribute which he had stipulated with the turkish sultan and ratified the treaty by an oath of allegiance from which he could absolve his conscience so soon as the mogul arms had retired from anatolia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the fears and fancy of nations ascribed to the ambitious tamerlane a new design of vast and romantic compass a design of subduing egypt and africa marching from the nile to the atlantic ocean entering europe by the straits of gibraltar and after imposing his yoke on the kingdoms of christendom of returning home by the deserts of russia and tartary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this remote and perhaps imaginary danger was averted by the submission of the sultan of egypt the honors of the prayer and the coin attested at cairo the supremacy of timour and a rare gift of a giraffe or camelopard and nine ostriches represented at samarcand the tribute of the african world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our imagination is not less astonished by the portrait of a mogul who in his camp before smyrna meditates and almost accomplishes the invasion of the chinese empire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> timour was urged to this enterprise by national honor and religious zeal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the torrents which he had shed of mussulman blood could be expiated only by an equal destruction of the infidels and as he now stood at the gates of paradise he might best secure his glorious entrance by demolishing the idols of china founding mosques in every city and establishing the profession of faith in one god and his prophet mahomet <end> <end>

<start> <start> a general indulgence was proclaimed every law was relaxed every pleasure was allowed the people was free the sovereign was idle and the historian of timour may remark that after devoting fifty years to the attainment of empire the only happy period of his life were the two months in which he ceased to exercise his power <end> <end>

<start> <start> it was in the year that they departed from the court of herat to which place the fame of timour has pervaded the east and west his posterity is still invested with the imperial title and the admiration of his subjects who revered him almost as a deity may be justified in some degree by the praise or confession of his bitterest enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although he was lame of a hand and foot his form and stature were not unworthy of his rank and his vigorous health so essential to himself and to the world was corroborated by temperance and exercise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his familiar discourse he was grave and modest and if he was ignorant of the arabic language he spoke with fluency and elegance the persian and turkish idioms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was his delight to converse with the learned on topics of history and science and the amusement of his leisure hours was the game of chess which he improved or corrupted with new refinements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his religion he was a zealous though not perhaps an orthodox mussulman but his sound understanding may tempt us to believe that a superstitious reverence for omens and prophecies for saints and astrologers was only affected as an instrument of policy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the government of a vast empire he stood alone and absolute without a rebel to oppose his power a favorite to seduce his affections or a minister to mislead his judgment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was his firmest maxim that whatever might be the consequence the word of the prince should never be disputed or recalled but his foes have maliciously observed that the commands of anger and destruction were more strictly executed than those of beneficence and favor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his sons and grandsons of whom timour left sixandthirty at his decease were his first and most submissive subjects and whenever they deviated from their duty they were corrected according to the laws of zingis with the bastinade and afterwards restored to honor and command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps his heart was not devoid of the social virtues perhaps he was not incapable of loving his friends and pardoning his enemies but the rules of morality are founded on the public interest and it may be sufficient to applaud the wisdom of a monarch for the liberality by which he is not impoverished and for the justice by which he is strengthened and enriched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to maintain the harmony of authority and obedience to chastise the proud to protect the weak to reward the deserving to banish vice and idleness from his dominions to secure the traveller and merchant to restrain the depredations of the soldier to cherish the labors of the husbandman to encourage industry and learning and by an equal and moderate assessment to increase the revenue without increasing the taxes are indeed the duties of a prince but in the discharge of these duties he finds an ample and immediate recompense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> timour might boast that at his accession to the throne asia was the prey of anarchy and rapine whilst under his prosperous monarchy a child fearless and unhurt might carry a purse of gold from the east to the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such was his confidence of merit that from this reformation he derived an excuse for his victories and a title to universal dominion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the four following observations will serve to appreciate his claim to the public gratitude and perhaps we shall conclude that the mogul emperor was rather the scourge than the benefactor of mankind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if some partial disorders some local oppressions were healed by the sword of timour the remedy was far more pernicious than the disease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by their rapine cruelty and discord the petty tyrants of persia might afflict their subjects but whole nations were crushed under the footsteps of the reformer <end> <end>

<start> <start> his most destructive wars were rather inroads than conquests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he invaded turkestan kipzak russia hindostan syria anatolia armenia and georgia without a hope or a desire of preserving those distant provinces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from thence he departed laden with spoil but he left behind him neither troops to awe the contumacious nor magistrates to protect the obedient natives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had broken the fabric of their ancient government he abandoned them to the evils which his invasion had aggravated or caused nor were these evils compensated by any present or possible benefits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kingdoms of transoxiana and persia were the proper field which he labored to cultivate and adorn as the perpetual inheritance of his family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his peaceful labors were often interrupted and sometimes blasted by the absence of the conqueror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he triumphed on the volga or the ganges his servants and even his sons forgot their master and their duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the public and private injuries were poorly redressed by the tardy rigor of inquiry and punishment and we must be content to praise the institutions of timour as the specious idea of a perfect monarchy <end> <end>

<start> <start> it appears to me said the daguerreotypist smiling that uncle venner has the principles of fourier at the bottom of his wisdom only they have not quite so much distinctness in his mind as in that of the systematizing frenchman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come phoebe said hepzibah it is time to bring the currants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then while the yellow richness of the declining sunshine still fell into the open space of the garden phoebe brought out a loaf of bread and a china bowl of currants freshly gathered from the bushes and crushed with sugar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these with waterbut not from the fountain of ill omen close at handconstituted all the entertainment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile holgrave took some pains to establish an intercourse with clifford actuated it might seem entirely by an impulse of kindliness in order that the present hour might be cheerfuller than most which the poor recluse had spent or was destined yet to spend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless in the artists deep thoughtful allobservant eyes there was now and then an expression not sinister but questionable as if he had some other interest in the scene than a stranger a youthful and unconnected adventurer might be supposed to have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with great mobility of outward mood however he applied himself to the task of enlivening the party and with so much success that even darkhued hepzibah threw off one tint of melancholy and made what shift she could with the remaining portion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phoebe said to herselfhow pleasant he can be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for uncle venner as a mark of friendship and approbation he readily consented to afford the young man his countenance in the way of his professionnot metaphorically be it understood but literally by allowing a daguerreotype of his face so familiar to the town to be exhibited at the entrance of holgraves studio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clifford as the company partook of their little banquet grew to be the gayest of them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either it was one of those upquivering flashes of the spirit to which minds in an abnormal state are liable or else the artist had subtly touched some chord that made musical vibration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed what with the pleasant summer evening and the sympathy of this little circle of not unkindly souls it was perhaps natural that a character so susceptible as cliffords should become animated and show itself readily responsive to what was said around him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he gave out his own thoughts likewise with an airy and fanciful glow so that they glistened as it were through the arbor and made their escape among the interstices of the foliage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been as cheerful no doubt while alone with phoebe but never with such tokens of acute although partial intelligence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as the sunlight left the peaks of the seven gables so did the excitement fade out of cliffords eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gazed vaguely and mournfully about him as if he missed something precious and missed it the more drearily for not knowing precisely what it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he murmured hoarsely and indistinctly hardly shaping out the words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many many years have i waited for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are old and worn with troubles that ought never to have befallen you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are partly crazy and partly imbecile a ruin a failure as almost everybody isthough some in less degree or less perceptibly than their fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fate has no happiness in store for you unless your quiet home in the old family residence with the faithful hepzibah and your long summer afternoons with phoebe and these sabbath festivals with uncle venner and the daguerreotypist deserve to be called happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if not the thing itself it is marvellously like it and the more so for that ethereal and intangible quality which causes it all to vanish at too close an introspection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take it therefore while you may murmur notquestion notbut make the most of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the inertness or what we may term the vegetative character of his ordinary mood clifford would perhaps have been content to spend one day after another interminablyor at least throughout the summertimein just the kind of life described in the preceding pages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fancying however that it might be for his benefit occasionally to diversify the scene phoebe sometimes suggested that he should look out upon the life of the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this purpose they used to mount the staircase together to the second story of the house where at the termination of a wide entry there was an arched window of uncommonly large dimensions shaded by a pair of curtains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it opened above the porch where there had formerly been a balcony the balustrade of which had long since gone to decay and been removed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this arched window throwing it open but keeping himself in comparative obscurity by means of the curtain clifford had an opportunity of witnessing such a portion of the great worlds movement as might be supposed to roll through one of the retired streets of a not very populous city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he and phoebe made a sight as well worth seeing as any that the city could exhibit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pale gray childish aged melancholy yet often simply cheerful and sometimes delicately intelligent aspect of clifford peering from behind the faded crimson of the curtain watching the monotony of everyday occurrences with a kind of inconsequential interest and earnestness and at every petty throb of his sensibility turning for sympathy to the eyes of the bright young girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if once he were fairly seated at the window even pyncheon street would hardly be so dull and lonely but that somewhere or other along its extent clifford might discover matter to occupy his eye and titillate if not engross his observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> things familiar to the youngest child that had begun its outlook at existence seemed strange to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cab an omnibus with its populous interior dropping here and there a passenger and picking up another and thus typifying that vast rolling vehicle the world the end of whose journey is everywhere and nowhere these objects he followed eagerly with his eyes but forgot them before the dust raised by the horses and wheels had settled along their track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as regarded novelties among which cabs and omnibuses were to be reckoned his mind appeared to have lost its proper gripe and retentiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice or thrice for example during the sunny hours of the day a watercart went along by the pyncheon house leaving a broad wake of moistened earth instead of the white dust that had risen at a ladys lightest footfall it was like a summer shower which the city authorities had caught and tamed and compelled it into the commonest routine of their convenience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the watercart clifford could never grow familiar it always affected him with just the same surprise as at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mind took an apparently sharp impression from it but lost the recollection of this perambulatory shower before its next reappearance as completely as did the street itself along which the heat so quickly strewed white dust again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clifford could hear the obstreperous howl of the steamdevil and by leaning a little way from the arched window could catch a glimpse of the trains of cars flashing a brief transit across the extremity of the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of terrible energy thus forced upon him was new at every recurrence and seemed to affect him as disagreeably and with almost as much surprise the hundredth time as the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing gives a sadder sense of decay than this loss or suspension of the power to deal with unaccustomed things and to keep up with the swiftness of the passing moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it can merely be a suspended animation for were the power actually to perish there would be little use of immortality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are less than ghosts for the time being whenever this calamity befalls us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clifford was indeed the most inveterate of conservatives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the antique fashions of the street were dear to him even such as were characterized by a rudeness that would naturally have annoyed his fastidious senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he loved the old rumbling and jolting carts the former track of which he still found in his longburied remembrance as the observer of today finds the wheeltracks of ancient vehicles in herculaneum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the butchers cart with its snowy canopy was an acceptable object so was the fishcart heralded by its horn so likewise was the countrymans cart of vegetables plodding from door to door with long pauses of the patient horse while his owner drove a trade in turnips carrots summersquashes stringbeans green peas and new potatoes with half the housewives of the neighborhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bakers cart with the harsh music of its bells had a pleasant effect on clifford because as few things else did it jingled the very dissonance of yore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one afternoon a scissorgrinder chanced to set his wheel agoing under the pyncheon elm and just in front of the arched window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> children came running with their mothers scissors or the carvingknife or the paternal razor or anything else that lacked an edge except indeed poor cliffords wits that the grinder might apply the article to his magic wheel and give it back as good as new <end> <end> 
<start> <start> round went the busily revolving machinery kept in motion by the scissorgrinders foot and wore away the hard steel against the hard stone whence issued an intense and spiteful prolongation of a hiss as fierce as those emitted by satan and his compeers in pandemonium though squeezed into smaller compass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an ugly little venomous serpent of a noise as ever did petty violence to human ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sound however disagreeable had very brisk life in it and together with the circle of curious children watching the revolutions of the wheel appeared to give him a more vivid sense of active bustling and sunshiny existence than he had attained in almost any other way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless its charm lay chiefly in the past for the scissorgrinders wheel had hissed in his childish ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sometimes made doleful complaint that there were no stagecoaches nowadays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he asked in an injured tone what had become of all those old squaretopped chaises with wings sticking out on either side that used to be drawn by a ploughhorse and driven by a farmers wife and daughter peddling whortleberries and blackberries about the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their disappearance made him doubt he said whether the berries had not left off growing in the broad pastures and along the shady country lanes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but anything that appealed to the sense of beauty in however humble a way did not require to be recommended by these old associations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes will you agree to take me to yokohama <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sailor leaned on the railing opened his eyes wide and said is your honour joking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have missed the carnatic and i must get to yokohama by the th at the latest to take the boat for san francisco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry said the sailor but it is impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i offer you a hundred pounds per day and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if i reach yokohama in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pilot walked away a little distance and gazed out to sea evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fogg turned to aouda and asked her you would not be afraid would you madam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pilot now returned shuffling his hat in his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well your honour replied he i could not risk myself my men or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides we could not reach yokohama in time for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from hong kong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but added the pilot it might be arranged another way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by going to nagasaki at the extreme south of japan or even to shanghai which is only eight hundred miles from here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in going to shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the chinese coast which would be a great advantage as the currents run northward and would aid us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fogg i must take the american steamer at yokohama and not at shanghai or nagasaki <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the san francisco steamer does not start from yokohama <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it puts in at yokohama and nagasaki but it starts from shanghai <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the th at seven in the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have therefore four days before us that is ninetysix hours and in that time if we had good luck and a southwest wind and the sea was calm we could make those eight hundred miles to shanghai <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you could go in an hour as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it would not put your honour out here are two hundred pounds on account sir added phileas fogg turning to fix if you would like to take advantage thanks sir i was about to ask the favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in half an hour we shall go on board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> urged aouda who was much disturbed by the servants disappearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall do all i can to find him replied phileas fogg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while fix in a feverish nervous state repaired to the pilotboat the others directed their course to the policestation at hong kong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phileas fogg there gave passepartouts description and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same formalities having been gone through at the french consulate and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage which had been sent back there they returned to the wharf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was now three oclock and pilotboat no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with its crew on board and its provisions stored away was ready for departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her shining copper sheathing her galvanised ironwork her deck white as ivory betrayed the pride taken by john bunsby in making her presentable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her two masts leaned a trifle backward she carried brigantine foresail stormjib and standingjib and was well rigged for running before the wind and she seemed capable of brisk speed which indeed she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilotboat races <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crew of the tankadere was composed of john bunsby the master and four hardy mariners who were familiar with the chinese seas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john bunsby himself a man of fortyfive or thereabouts vigorous sunburnt with a sprightly expression of the eye and energetic and selfreliant countenance would have inspired confidence in the most timid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phileas fogg and aouda went on board where they found fix already installed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> below deck was a square cabin of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots above a circular divan in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry to have nothing better to offer you said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the white banner scaled the wall she was struck upon the head with a stone and was again tumbled down into the ditch but she only cried all the more as she lay there on on my countrymen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and fear nothing for the lord hath delivered them into our hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after this new success of the maids several other fortresses and places which had previously held out against the dauphin were delivered up without a battle and at patay she defeated the remainder of the english army and set up her victorious white banner on a field where twelve hundred englishmen lay dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she now urged the dauphin who always kept out of the way when there was any fighting to proceed to rheims as the first part of her mission was accomplished and to complete the whole by being crowned there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dauphin was in no particular hurry to do this as rheims was a long way off and the english and the duke of burgundy were still strong in the country through which the road lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however they set forth with ten thousand men and again the maid of orleans rode on and on upon her white warhorse and in her shining armour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever they came to a town which yielded readily the soldiers believed in her but whenever they came to a town which gave them any trouble they began to murmur that she was an impostor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter was particularly the case at troyes which finally yielded however through the persuasion of one richard a friar of the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> friar richard was in the old doubt about the maid of orleans until he had sprinkled her well with holy water and had also well sprinkled the threshold of the gate by which she came into the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finding that it made no change in her or the gate he said as the other grave old gentlemen had said that it was all right and became her great ally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so at last by dint of riding on and on the maid of orleans and the dauphin and the ten thousand sometimes believing and sometimes unbelieving men came to rheims <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the great cathedral of rheims the dauphin actually was crowned charles the seventh in a great assembly of the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the maid who with her white banner stood beside the king in that hour of his triumph kneeled down upon the pavement at his feet and said with tears that what she had been inspired to do was done and that the only recompense she asked for was that she should now have leave to go back to her distant home and her sturdily incredulous father and her first simple escort the village wheelwright and cartmaker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and made her and her family as noble as a king could and settled upon her the income of a count <end> <end> 
<start> <start> happy had it been for the maid of orleans if she had resumed her rustic dress that day and had gone home to the little chapel and the wild hills and had forgotten all these things and had been a good mans wife and had heard no stranger voices than the voices of little children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not to be and she continued helping the king she did a world for him in alliance with friar richard and trying to improve the lives of the coarse soldiers and leading a religious an unselfish and a modest life herself beyond any doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still many times she prayed the king to let her go home and once she even took off her bright armour and hung it up in a church meaning never to wear it more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the king always won her back again while she was of any use to him and so she went on and on and on to her doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the duke of bedford who was a very able man began to be active for england and by bringing the war back into france and by holding the duke of burgundy to his faith to distress and disturb charles very much charles sometimes asked the maid of orleans what the voices said about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the voices had become very like ordinary voices in perplexed times contradictory and confused so that now they said one thing and now said another and the maid lost credit every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charles marched on paris which was opposed to him and attacked the suburb of saint honore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this fight being again struck down into the ditch she was abandoned by the whole army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lay unaided among a heap of dead and crawled out how she could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then some of her believers went over to an opposition maid catherine of la rochelle who said she was inspired to tell where there were treasures of buried money though she never did and then joan accidentally broke the old old sword and others said that her power was broken with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally at the siege of compigne held by the duke of burgundy where she did valiant service she was basely left alone in a retreat though facing about and fighting to the last and an archer pulled her off her horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o the uproar that was made and the thanksgivings that were sung about the capture of this one poor countrygirl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o the way in which she was demanded to be tried for sorcery and heresy and anything else you like by the inquisitorgeneral of france and by this great man and by that great man until it is wearisome to think of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was bought at last by the bishop of beauvais for ten thousand francs and was shut up in her narrow prison plain joan of arc again and maid of orleans no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should never have done if i were to tell you how they had joan out to examine her and crossexamine her and reexamine her and worry her into saying anything and everything and how all sorts of scholars and doctors bestowed their utmost tediousness upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sixteen times she was brought out and shut up again and worried and entrapped and argued with until she was heartsick of the dreary business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the last occasion of this kind she was brought into a burialplace at rouen dismally decorated with a scaffold and a stake and faggots and the executioner and a pulpit with a friar therein and an awful sermon ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very affecting to know that even at that pass the poor girl honoured the mean vermin of a king who had so used her for his purposes and so abandoned her and that while she had been regardless of reproaches heaped upon herself she spoke out courageously for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was natural in one so young to hold to life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to save her life she signed a declaration prepared for her signed it with a cross for she couldnt write that all her visions and voices had come from the devil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon her recanting the past and protesting that she would never wear a mans dress in future she was condemned to imprisonment for life on the bread of sorrow and the water of but on the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction the visions and the voices soon returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite natural that they should do so for that kind of disease is much aggravated by fasting loneliness and anxiety of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not only got out of joan that she considered herself inspired again but she was taken in a mans dress which had been left to entrap her in her prison and which she put on in her solitude perhaps in remembrance of her past glories perhaps because the imaginary voices told her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this relapse into the sorcery and heresy and anything else you like she was sentenced to be burnt to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the marketplace of rouen in the hideous dress which the monks had invented for such spectacles with priests and bishops sitting in a gallery looking on though some had the christian grace to go away unable to endure the infamous scene this shrieking girl last seen amidst the smoke and fire holding a crucifix between her hands last heard calling upon christ was burnt to ashes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they threw her ashes into the river seine but they will rise against her murderers on the last day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the moment of her capture neither the french king nor one single man in all his court raised a finger to save her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is no defence of them that they may have never really believed in her or that they may have won her victories by their skill and bravery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more they pretended to believe in her the more they had caused her to believe in herself and she had ever been true to them ever brave ever nobly devoted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is no wonder that they who were in all things false to themselves false to one another false to their country false to heaven false to earth should be monsters of ingratitude and treachery to a helpless peasant girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the picturesque old town of rouen where weeds and grass grow high on the cathedral towers and the venerable norman streets are still warm in the blessed sunlight though the monkish fires that once gleamed horribly upon them have long grown cold there is a statue of joan of arc in the scene of her last agony the square to which she has given its present name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know some statues of modern times even in the worlds metropolis i think which commemorate less constancy less earnestness smaller claims upon the worlds attention and much greater impostors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bad deeds seldom prosper happily for mankind and the english cause gained no advantage from the cruel death of joan of arc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a long time the war went heavily on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the duke of bedford died the alliance with the duke of burgundy was broken and lord talbot became a great general on the english side in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but two of the consequences of wars are famine because the people cannot peacefully cultivate the ground and pestilence which comes of want misery and suffering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both these horrors broke out in both countries and lasted for two wretched years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the war went on again and came by slow degrees to be so badly conducted by the english government that within twenty years from the execution of the maid of orleans of all the great french conquests the town of calais alone remained in english hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while these victories and defeats were taking place in the course of time many strange things happened at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young king as he grew up proved to be very unlike his great father and showed himself a miserable puny creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no harm in him he had a great aversion to shedding blood which was something but he was a weak silly helpless young man and a mere shuttlecock to the great lordly battledores about the court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of these battledores cardinal beaufort a relation of the king and the duke of gloucester were at first the most powerful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the duke of gloucester had a wife who was nonsensically accused of practising witchcraft to cause the kings death and lead to her husbands coming to the throne he being the next heir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was charged with having by the help of a ridiculous old woman named margery who was called a witch made a little waxen doll in the kings likeness and put it before a slow fire that it might gradually melt away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was supposed in such cases that the death of the person whom the doll was made to represent was sure to happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether the duchess was as ignorant as the rest of them and really did make such a doll with such an intention i dont know but you and i know very well that she might have made a thousand dolls if she had been stupid enough and might have melted them all without hurting the king or anybody else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however she was tried for it and so was old margery and so was one of the dukes chaplains who was charged with having assisted them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both he and margery were put to death and the duchess after being taken on foot and bearing a lighted candle three times round the city as a penance was imprisoned for life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the duke himself took all this pretty quietly and made as little stir about the matter as if he were rather glad to be rid of the duchess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was not destined to keep himself out of trouble long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the royal shuttlecock being threeandtwenty the battledores were very anxious to get him married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the duke of gloucester wanted him to marry a daughter of the count of armagnac but the cardinal and the earl of suffolk were all for margaret the daughter of the king of sicily who they knew was a resolute ambitious woman and would govern the king as she chose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make friends with this lady the earl of suffolk who went over to arrange the match consented to accept her for the kings wife without any fortune and even to give up the two most valuable possessions england then had in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the marriage was arranged on terms very advantageous to the lady and lord suffolk brought her to england and she was married at westminster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on what pretence this queen and her party charged the duke of gloucester with high treason within a couple of years it is impossible to make out the matter is so confused but they pretended that the kings life was in danger and they took the duke prisoner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fortnight afterwards he was found dead in bed they said and his body was shown to the people and lord suffolk came in for the best part of his estates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know by this time how strangely liable state prisoners were to sudden death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if cardinal beaufort had any hand in this matter it did him no good for he died within six weeks thinking it very hard and curious at eighty years old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he could not live to be pope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the time when england had completed her loss of all her great french conquests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people charged the loss principally upon the earl of suffolk now a duke who had made those easy terms about the royal marriage and who they believed had even been bought by france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he was impeached as a traitor on a great number of charges but chiefly on accusations of having aided the french king and of designing to make his own son king of england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the commons and the people being violent against him the king was made by his friends to interpose to save him by banishing him for five years and proroguing the parliament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the duke had much ado to escape from a london mob two thousand strong who lay in wait for him in st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giless fields but he got down to his own estates in suffolk and sailed away from ipswich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sailing across the channel he sent into calais to know if he might land there but they kept his boat and men in the harbour until an english ship carrying a hundred and fifty men and called the nicholas of the tower came alongside his little vessel and ordered him on board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> welcome traitor as men say was the captains grim and not very respectful salutation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was kept on board a prisoner for eightandforty hours and then a small boat appeared rowing toward the ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as this boat came nearer it was seen to have in it a block a rusty sword and an executioner in a black mask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the duke was handed down into it and there his head was cut off with six strokes of the rusty sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the little boat rowed away to dover beach where the body was cast out and left until the duchess claimed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by whom high in authority this murder was committed has never appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there now arose in kent an irishman who gave himself the name of mortimer but whose real name was jack cade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack in imitation of wat tyler though he was a very different and inferior sort of man addressed the kentish men upon their wrongs occasioned by the bad government of england among so many battledores and such a poor shuttlecock and the kentish men rose up to the number of twenty thousand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their place of assembly was blackheath where headed by jack they put forth two papers which they called the complaint of the commons of kent and the requests of the captain of the great assembly in kent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the royal army coming up with them here they beat it and killed their general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then jack dressed himself in the dead generals armour and led his men to london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack passed into the city from southwark over the bridge and entered it in triumph giving the strictest orders to his men not to plunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having made a show of his forces there while the citizens looked on quietly he went back into southwark in good order and passed the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next day he came back again having got hold in the meantime of lord say an unpopular nobleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says jack to the lord mayor and judges will you be so good as to make a tribunal in guildhall and try me this nobleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the court being hastily made he was found guilty and jack and his men cut his head off on cornhill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they also cut off the head of his son inlaw and then went back in good order to southwark again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but although the citizens could bear the beheading of an unpopular lord they could not bear to have their houses pillaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it did so happen that jack after dinner perhaps he had drunk a little too much began to plunder the house where he lodged upon which of course his men began to imitate him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a tall black haired man met her and noticed her tears and stopping asked why it was that she was crying and she sobbingly replied that it was because they could not let her into the sundayschool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lifted her to my shoulder says dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conwell in telling of this for after hearing the story elsewhere i asked him to tell it to me himself for it seemed almost too strange to be true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lifted her to my shoulderand one realizes the pretty scene it must have made for the little girl to go through the crowd of people drying her tears and riding proudly on the shoulders of the kindly tall dark man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said to her that i would take her in and i did so and i said to her that we should some day have a room big enough for all who should come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she went home she told her parentsi only learned this afterwardthat she was going to save money to help build the larger church and sundayschool that dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her parents pleasantly humored her in the idea and let her run errands and do little tasks to earn pennies and she began dropping the pennies into her bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a lovable little thingbut in only a few weeks after that she was taken suddenly ill and died and at the funeral her father told me quietly of how his little girl had been saving money for a buildingfund <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there at the funeral he handed me what she had savedjust fifty dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conwell does not say how deeply he was moved he is after all a man of very few words as to his own emotions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a deep tenderness had crept into his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at a meeting of the church trustees i told of this gift of fiftyseven centsthe first gift toward the proposed buildingfund of the new church that was some time to exist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for until then the matter had barely been spoken of as a new church building had been simply a possibility for the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trustees seemed much impressed and it turned out that they were far more impressed than i could possibly have hoped for in a few days one of them came to me and said that he thought it would be an excellent idea to buy a lot on broad streetthe very lot on which the building now stands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conwell that he did not point out what every one who knows him would understand that it was his own inspiration put into the trustees which resulted in this quick and definite move on the part of one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i talked the matter over with the owner of the property and told him of the beginning of the fund the story of the little girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man was not one of our church nor in fact was he a churchgoer at all but he listened attentively to the tale of the fiftyseven cents and simply said he was quite ready to go ahead and sell us that piece of land for ten thousand dollars takingand the unexpectedness of this deeply touched me taking a first payment of just fiftyseven cents and letting the entire balance stand on a fivepercent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it seemed to me that it would be the right thing to accept this unexpectedly liberal proposition and i went over the entire matter on that basis with the trustees and some of the other members and all the people were soon talking of having a new church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was not done in that way after all for fine though that way would have been there was to be one still finer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not long after my talk with the man who owned the land and his surprisingly goodhearted proposition an exchange was arranged for me one evening with a mount holly church and my wife went with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we came back late and it was cold and wet and miserable but as we approached our home we saw that it was all lighted from top to bottom and it was clear that it was full of people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said to my wife that they seemed to be having a better time than we had had and we went in curious to know what it was all about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it turned out that our absence had been intentionally arranged and that the church people had gathered at our home to meet us on our return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i was utterly amazed for the spokesman told me that the entire ten thousand dollars had been raised and that the land for the church that i wanted was free of debt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all had come so quickly and directly from that dear little girls doesnt it seem like a fairy tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arthur donnithorne in feeling that when a man whose duty lies in that sort of work shows a character which would make him an example in any station his merit should be acknowledged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is one of those to whom honour is due and his friends should delight to honour him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know adam bede welli know what he is as a workman and what he has been as a son and brotherand i am saying the simplest truth when i say that i respect him as much as i respect any man living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am not speaking to you about a stranger some of you are his intimate friends and i believe there is not one here who does not know enough of him to join heartily in drinking his health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irwine paused arthur jumped up and filling his glass said a bumper to adam bede and may he live to have sons as faithful and clever as himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no hearer not even bartle massey was so delighted with this toast as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tough work as his first speech had been he would have started up to make another if he had not known the extreme irregularity of such a course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was he found an outlet for his feeling in drinking his ale unusually fast and setting down his glass with a swing of his arm and a determined rap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if jonathan burge and a few others felt less comfortable on the occasion they tried their best to look contented and so the toast was drunk with a goodwill apparently unanimous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adam was rather paler than usual when he got up to thank his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a good deal moved by this public tributevery naturally for he was in the presence of all his little world and it was uniting to do him honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he felt no shyness about speaking not being troubled with small vanity or lack of words he looked neither awkward nor embarrassed but stood in his usual firm upright attitude with his head thrown a little backward and his hands perfectly still in that rough dignity which is peculiar to intelligent honest wellbuilt workmen who are never wondering what is their business in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt expect anything o this sort for its a good deal more than my wages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ive the more reason to be grateful to you captain and to you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irwine and to all my friends here whove drunk my health and wished me well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it ud be nonsense for me to be saying i dont at all deserve th opinion you have of me that ud be poor thanks to you to say that youve known me all these years and yet havent sense enough to find out a great deal o the truth about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think if i undertake to do a bit o work ill do it well be my pay big or littleand thats true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id be ashamed to stand before you here if it wasna true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it seems to me thats a mans plain duty and nothing to be conceited about and its pretty clear to me as ive never done more than my duty for let us do what we will its only making use o the sperrit and the powers that ha been given to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so this kindness o yours im sure is no debt you owe me but a free gift and as such i accept it and am thankful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as to this new employment ive taken in hand ill only say that i took it at captain donnithornes desire and that ill try to fulfil his expectations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id wish for no better lot than to work under him and to know that while i was getting my own bread i was taking care of his intrests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i believe hes one o those gentlemen as wishes to do the right thing and to leave the world a bit better than he found it which its my belief every man may do whether hes gentle or simple whether he sets a good bit o work going and finds the money or whether he does the work with his own hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres no occasion for me to say any more about what i feel towards him i hope to show it through the rest o my life in my actions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were various opinions about adams speech some of the women whispered that he didnt show himself thankful enough and seemed to speak as proud as could be but most of the men were of opinion that nobody could speak more straightforard and that adam was as fine a chap as need to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while such observations were being buzzed about mingled with wonderings as to what the old squire meant to do for a bailiff and whether he was going to have a steward the two gentlemen had risen and were walking round to the table where the wives and children sat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was none of the strong ale here of course but wine and dessert sparkling gooseberry for the young ones and some good sherry for the mothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poyser was at the head of this table and totty was now seated in her lap bending her small nose deep down into a wineglass in search of the nuts floating there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> werent you pleased to hear your husband make such a good speech today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh sir the men are mostly so tonguetiedyoure forced partly to guess what they mean as you do wi the dumb creaturs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think you could have made it better for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir when i want to say anything i can mostly find words to say it in thank god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not as im afinding faut wi my husband for if hes a man o few words what he says hell stand to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure i never saw a prettier party than this arthur said looking round at the applecheeked children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt and the miss irwines will come up and see you presently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were afraid of the noise of the toasts but it would be a shame for them not to see you at table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked on speaking to the mothers and patting the children while mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irwine satisfied himself with standing still and nodding at a distance that no ones attention might be disturbed from the young squire the hero of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arthur did not venture to stop near hetty but merely bowed to her as he passed along the opposite side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foolish child felt her heart swelling with discontent for what woman was ever satisfied with apparent neglect even when she knows it to be the mask of love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hetty thought this was going to be the most miserable day she had had for a long while a moment of chill daylight and reality came across her dream arthur who had seemed so near to her only a few hours before was separated from her as the hero of a great procession is separated from a small outsider in the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great dance was not to begin until eight oclock but for any lads and lasses who liked to dance on the shady grass before then there was music always at handfor was not the band of the benefit club capable of playing excellent jigs reels and hornpipes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besides this there was a grand band hired from rosseter who with their wonderful windinstruments and puffed out cheeks were themselves a delightful show to the small boys and girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to say nothing of joshua ranns fiddle which by an act of generous forethought he had provided himself with in case any one should be of sufficiently pure taste to prefer dancing to a solo on that instrument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime when the sun had moved off the great open space in front of the house the games began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were of course wellsoaped poles to be climbed by the boys and youths races to be run by the old women races to be run in sacks heavy weights to be lifted by the strong men and a long list of challenges to such ambitious attempts as that of walking as many yards possible on one leg feats in which it was generally remarked that wiry ben being the lissomst springest fellow i the country was sure to be pre eminent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to crown all there was to be a donkeyracethat sublimest of all races conducted on the grand socialistic idea of everybody encouraging everybody elses donkey and the sorriest donkey winning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and soon after four o ciock splendid old mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irwine in her damask satin and jewels and black lace was led out by arthur followed by the whole family party to her raised seat under the striped marquee where she was to give out the prizes to the victors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> staid formal miss lydia had requested to resign that queenly office to the royal old lady and arthur was pleased with this opportunity of gratifying his godmothers taste for stateliness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> donnithorne the delicately clean finely scented withered old man led out miss irwine with his air of punctilious acid politeness mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gawaine brought miss lydia looking neutral and stiff in an elegant peachblossom silk and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irwine came last with his pale sister anne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no other friend of the family besides mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gawaine was invited today there was to be a grand dinner for the neighbouring gentry on the morrow but today all the forces were required for the entertainment of the tenants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a sunk fence in front of the marquee dividing the lawn from the park but a temporary bridge had been made for the passage of the victors and the groups of people standing or seated here and there on benches stretched on each side of the open space from the white marquees up to the sunk fence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon my word its a pretty sight said the old lady in her deep voice when she was seated and looked round on the bright scene with its darkgreen background and its the last feteday im likely to see unless you make haste and get married arthur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but take care you get a charming bride else i would rather die without seeing her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre so terribly fastidious godmother said arthur im afraid i should never satisfy you with my choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i wont forgive you if shes not handsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant be put off with amiability which is always the excuse people are making for the existence of plain people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she must not be silly that will never do because youll want managing and a silly woman cant manage you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who is that tall young man dauphin with the mild face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there standing without his hat and taking such care of that tall old woman by the side of himhis mother of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is seth bede adams brothera methodist but a very good fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor seth has looked rather downhearted of late i thought it was because of his fathers dying in that sad way but joshua rann tells me he wanted to marry that sweet little methodist preacher who was here about a month ago and i suppose she refused him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there are no end of people here that i dont know for theyre grown up and altered so since i used to go about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> donnithorne who was holding a double glass up to his eyes to see the expression of that young mans face so far off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face is nothing but a pale blurred spot to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i fancy i have the advantage of you when we come to look close <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah my dear sir you began with being very nearsighted and those nearsighted eyes always wear the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want very strong spectacles to read with but then i think my eyes get better and better for things at a distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose if i could live another fifty years i should be blind to everything that wasnt out of other peoples sight like a man who stands in a well and sees nothing but the stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see said arthur the old women are ready to set out on their race now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the longlegged one unless theyre going to have several heats and then the little wiry one may win <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are the poysers mother not far off on the right hand said miss irwine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be sure i will said the old lady giving a gracious bow to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a woman who sends me such excellent creamcheese is not to be neglected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a fat child that is she is holding on her knee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but who is that pretty girl with dark eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is hetty sorrel said miss lydia donnithorne martin poysers niecea very likely young person and welllooking too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my maid has taught her fine needlework and she has mended some lace of mine very respectably indeedvery respectably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why she has lived with the poysers six or seven years mother you must have seen her said miss irwine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no ive never seen her childat least not as she is now said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never seen anything so pretty since my young days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a pity such beauty as that should be thrown away among the farmers when its wanted so terribly among the good families without fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i daresay now shell marry a man who would have thought her just as pretty if she had had round eyes and red hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arthur dared not turn his eyes towards hetty while mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he feigned not to hear and to be occupied with something on the opposite side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he saw her plainly enough without looking saw her in heightened beauty because he heard her beauty praisedfor other mens opinion you know was like a native climate to arthurs feelings it was the air on which they thrived the best and grew strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was enough to turn any mans head any man in his place would have done and felt the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to give her up after all as he was determined to do would be an act that he should always look back upon with pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irwine replying to her last words i cant agree with you there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the common people are not quite so stupid as you imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the commonest man who has his ounce of sense and feeling is conscious of the difference between a lovely delicate woman and a coarse one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even a dog feels a difference in their presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man may be no better able than the dog to explain the influence the more refined beauty has on him but he feels it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless me dauphin what does an old bachelor like you know about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser than married men because they have time for more general contemplation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your fine critic of woman must never shackle his judgment by calling one woman his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as an example of what i was saying that pretty methodist preacher i mentioned just now told me that she had preached to the roughest miners and had never been treated with anything but the utmost respect and kindness by them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reason isthough she doesnt know itthat theres so much tenderness refinement and purity about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a woman as that brings with her airs from heaven that the coarsest fellow is not insensible to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres a delicate bit of womanhood or girlhood coming to receive a prize i suppose said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must be one of the racers in the sacks who had set off before we came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bit of womanhood was our old acquaintance bessy cranage otherwise chads bess whose large red cheeks and blowsy person had undergone an exaggeration of colour which if she had happened to be a heavenly body would have made her sublime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bessy i am sorry to say had taken to her earrings again since dinahs departure and was otherwise decked out in such small finery as she could muster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any one who could have looked into poor bessys heart would have seen a striking resemblance between her little hopes and anxieties and hettys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the advantage perhaps would have been on bessys side in the matter of feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then you see they were so very different outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would have been inclined to box bessys ears and you would have longed to kiss hetty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bessy had been tempted to run the arduous race partly from mere hedonish gaiety partly because of the prize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some one had said there were to be cloaks and other nice clothes for prizes and she approached the marquee fanning herself with her handkerchief but with exultation sparkling in her round eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is the prize for the first sackrace said miss lydia taking a large parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and giving it to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irwine before bessy came up an excellent grogram gown and a piece of flannel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt think the winner was to be so young i suppose aunt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> couldnt you find something else for this girl and save that grimlooking gown for one of the older women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have bought nothing but what is useful and substantial said miss lydia adjusting her own lace i should not think of encouraging a love of finery in young women of that class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a scarlet cloak but that is for the old woman who wins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this speech of miss lydias produced rather a mocking expression in mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irwines face as she looked at arthur while bessy came up and dropped a series of curtsies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well bessy here is your prizeexcellent warm things for winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure you have had hard work to win them this warm day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bessys lip fell as she saw the ugly heavy gownwhich felt so hot and disagreeable too on this july day and was such a great ugly thing to carry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dropped her curtsies again without looking up and with a growing tremulousness about the corners of her mouth and then turned away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor girl said arthur i think shes disappointed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish it had been something more to her taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes a boldlooking young person observed miss lydia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not at all one i should like to encourage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arthur silently resolved that he would make bessy a present of money before the day was over that she might buy something more to her mind but she not aware of the consolation in store for her turned out of the open space where she was visible from the marquee and throwing down the odious bundle under a tree began to cryvery much tittered at the while by the small boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this situation she was descried by her discreet matronly cousin who lost no time in coming up having just given the baby into her husbands charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said bess the matron taking up the bundle and examining it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yen sweltered yoursen i reckon running that fools race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an here theyn gien you lots o good grogram and flannel as should ha been gien by good rights to them as had the sense to keep away from such foolery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye might spare me a bit o this grogram to make clothes for the ladye war neer illnatured bess i neer said that on ye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye may take it all for what i care said bess the maiden with a pettish movement beginning to wipe away her tears and recover herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i could do wit if so be ye want to get rid ont said the disinterested cousin walking quickly away with the bundle lest chads bess should change her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that bonnycheeked lass was blessed with an elasticity of spirits that secured her from any rankling grief and by the time the grand climax of the donkeyrace came on her disappointment was entirely lost in the delightful excitement of attempting to stimulate the last donkey by hisses while the boys applied the argument of sticks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the strength of the donkey mind lies in adopting a course inversely as the arguments urged which well considered requires as great a mental force as the direct sequence and the present donkey proved the firstrate order of his intelligence by coming to a dead standstill just when the blows were thickest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great was the shouting of the crowd radiant the grinning of bill downes the stonesawyer and the fortunate rider of this superior beast which stood calm and stifflegged in the midst of its triumph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arthur himself had provided the prizes for the men and bill was made happy with a splendid pocketknife supplied with blades and gimlets enough to make a man at home on a desert island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had hardly returned from the marquee with the prize in his hand when it began to be understood that wiry ben proposed to amuse the company before the gentry went to dinner with an impromptu and gratuitous performancenamely a hornpipe the main idea of which was doubtless borrowed but this was to be developed by the dancer in so peculiar and complex a manner that no one could deny him the praise of originality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bull and the calf a bull was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through a narrow passage which led to his stall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a young calf came up and offered to go before and show him the way by which he could manage to pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> save yourself the trouble said the bull i knew that way long before you were born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stag the wolf and the sheep a stag asked a sheep to lend him a measure of wheat and said that the wolf would be his surety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sheep fearing some fraud was intended excused herself saying the wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants and to run off and you too can quickly outstrip me in your rapid flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how then shall i be able to find you when the day of payment comes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the peacock and the crane a peacock spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a crane that passed by ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying i am robed like a king in gold and purple and all the colors of the rainbow while you have not a bit of color on your wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> true replied the crane but i soar to the heights of heaven and lift up my voice to the stars while you walk below like a cock among the birds of the dunghill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fox and the hedgehog a fox swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of the current into a very deep ravine where he lay for a long time very much bruised sick and unable to move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a swarm of hungry bloodsucking flies settled upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hedgehog passing by saw his anguish and inquired if he should drive away the flies that were tormenting him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by no means replied the fox pray do not molest them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the hedgehog do you not want to be rid of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no returned the fox for these flies which you see are full of blood and sting me but little and if you rid me of these which are already satiated others more hungry will come in their place and will drink up all the blood i have left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eagle the cat and the wild sow an eagle made her nest at the top of a lofty oak a cat having found a convenient hole moved into the middle of the trunk and a wild sow with her young took shelter in a hollow at its foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cat cunningly resolved to destroy this chancemade colony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to carry out her design she climbed to the nest of the eagle and said destruction is preparing for you and for me too unfortunately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wild sow whom you see daily digging up the earth wishes to uproot the oak so she may on its fall seize our families as food for her young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having thus frightened the eagle out of her senses she crept down to the cave of the sow and said your children are in great danger for as soon as you go out with your litter to find food the eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having instilled these fears into the sow she went and pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when night came she went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens but feigning to be afraid she kept a lookout all through the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile the eagle full of fear of the sow sat still on the branches and the sow terrified by the eagle did not dare to go out from her cave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thus they both along with their families perished from hunger and afforded ample provision for the cat and her kittens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thief and the innkeeper a thief hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope of stealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had waited some days in vain he saw the innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before his door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thief sat down beside him and talked with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the conversation began to flag the thief yawned terribly and at the same time howled like a wolf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the innkeeper said why do you howl so fearfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell you said the thief but first let me ask you to hold my clothes or i shall tear them to pieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the manger of an ox and lay there cosily upon the straw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but soon the ox returning from its afternoon work came up to the manger and wanted to eat some of the straw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dog in a rage being awakened from its slumber stood up and barked at the ox and whenever it came near attempted to bite it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the ox had to ah people often grudge others what they cannot enjoy themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the old days men used to worship stocks and stones and idols and prayed to them to give them luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened that a man had often prayed to a wooden idol he had received from his father but his luck never seemed to change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he prayed and he prayed but still he remained as unlucky as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day in the greatest rage he went to the wooden god and with one blow swept it down from its pedestal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man himself even when he learned to speak intelligibly could tell us very little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remembered he had felt bet ter after the ship had anchored i suppose and that the darkness the wind and the rain took his breath away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this looks as if he had been on deck some time during that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we mustnt forget he had been taken out of his knowledge that he had been seasick and battened down below for four days that he had no general notion of a ship or of the sea and therefore could have no definite idea of what was happening to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rain the wind the darkness he knew he understood the bleating of the sheep and he remembered the pain of his wretchedness and misery his heartbroken as tonishment that it was neither seen nor understood his dismay at finding all the men angry and all the women fierce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had approached them as a beg gar it is true he said but in his country even if they gave nothing they spoke gently to beggars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children in his country were not taught to throw stones at those who asked for compassion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the woodlodge presented the horrible aspect of a dun geon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder that amy foster appeared to his eyes with the aureole of an angel of light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last winnie observed this isnt a very good horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes gleamed in the shadow of the cab straight ahead immovable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the box stevie shut his vacant mouth first in order to ejaculate earnestly dont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the driver holding high the reins twisted around the hook took no notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man turned slowly his bloated and sodden face of many colours bristling with white hairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the dirty back of his whiphand he rubbed the stubble sprouting on his enormous chin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mustnt whip queried the other in a thoughtful whisper and immediately whipped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did this not because his soul was cruel and his heart evil but because he had to earn his fare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for a time the walls of st stephens with its towers and pinnacles contemplated in immobility and silence a cab that jingled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on the bridge there was a commotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stevie suddenly proceeded to get down from the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were shouts on the pavement people ran forward the driver pulled up whispering curses of indignation and astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> winnie lowered the window and put her head out white as a ghost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the depths of the cab her mother was exclaiming in tones of anguish is that boy hurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stevie was not hurt he had not even fallen but excitement as usual had robbed him of the power of connected speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could do no more than stammer at the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> winnie put out her hand on to his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get up on the box directly and dont try to get down again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in trying to state the nature of that necessity he stammered himself into utter incoherence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no physical impossibility stood in the way of his whim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stevie could have managed easily to keep pace with the infirm dancing horse without getting out of breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her mother frightened and helpless in the depths of the conveyance entreated oh dont let him winnie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr verloc will be sorry to hear of this nonsense stevie i can tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> verlocs grief and unhappiness acting as usual powerfully upon stevies fundamentally docile disposition he abandoned all resistance and climbed up again on the box with a face of despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cabby turned at him his enormous and inflamed countenance truculently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you go for trying this silly game again young fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after delivering himself thus in a stern whisper strained almost to extinction he drove on ruminating solemnly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his mind the incident remained somewhat obscure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his intellect though it had lost its pristine vivacity in the benumbing years of sedentary exposure to the weather lacked not independence or sanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gravely he dismissed the hypothesis of stevie being a drunken young nipper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inside the cab the spell of silence in which the two women had endured shoulder to shoulder the jolting rattling and jingling of the journey had been broken by stevies outbreak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have only yourself to thank for it if you arent happy afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever peoplell think of us you throwing yourself like this on a charity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear screamed the old woman earnestly above the noise youve been the best of daughters to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to mr verloc there words failing her on the subject of mr verlocs excellence she turned her old tearful eyes to the roof of the cab <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she averted her head on the pretence of looking out of the window as if to judge of their progress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was insignificant and went on close to the curbstone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> night the early dirty night the sinister noisy hopeless and rowdy night of south london had overtaken her on her last cab drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the gaslight of the low fronted shops her big cheeks glowed with an orange hue under a black and mauve bonnet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs verlocs mothers complexion had become yellow by the effect of age and from a natural predisposition to biliousness favoured by the trials of a difficult and worried existence first as wife then as widow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a complexion that under the influence of a blush would take on an orange tint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this woman modest indeed but hardened in the fires of adversity of an age moreover when blushes are not expected had positively blushed before her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the privacy of a fourwheeler on her way to a charity cottage one of a row which by the exiguity of its dimensions and the simplicity of its accommodation might well have been devised in kindness as a place of training for the still more straitened circumstances of the grave she was forced to hid from her own child a blush of remorse and shame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew very well what they did think the people winnie had in her mind the old friends of her husband and others too whose interest she had solicited with such flattering success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not known before what a good beggar she could be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she guessed very well what inference was drawn from her application <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on account of that shrinking delicacy which exists side by side with aggressive brutality in masculine nature the inquiries into her circumstances had not been pushed very far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had checked them by a visible compression of the lips and some display of an emotion determined to be eloquently silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the men would become suddenly incurious after the manner of their kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she congratulated herself more than once on having nothing to do with women who being naturally more callous and avid of details would have been anxious to be exactly informed by what sort of unkind conduct her daughter and soninlaw had driven her to that sad extremity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only before the secretary of the great brewer m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and chairman of the charity who acting for his principal felt bound to be conscientiously inquisitive as to the real circumstances of the applicant that she had burst into tears outright and aloud as a cornered woman will weep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thin and polite gentleman after contemplating her with an air of being struck all of a heap abandoned his position under the cover of soothing remarks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deed of the charity did not absolutely specify childless widows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact it did not by any means disqualify her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the discretion of the committee must be an informed discretion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could understand very well her unwillingness to be a burden etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon to his profound disappointment mrs verlocs mother wept some more with an augmented vehemence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tears of that large female in a dark dusty wig and ancient silk dress festooned with dingy white cotton lace were the tears of genuine distress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had wept because she was heroic and unscrupulous and full of love for both her children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> girls frequently get sacrificed to the welfare of the boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the suppression of truth she was slandering her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course winnie was independent and need not care for the opinion of people that she would never see and who would never see her whereas poor stevie had nothing in the world he could call his own except his mothers heroism and unscrupulousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first sense of security following on winnies marriage wore off in time for nothing lasts and mrs verlocs mother in the seclusion of the back bedroom had recalled the teaching of that experience which the world impresses upon a widowed woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she had recalled it without vain bitterness her store of resignation amounted almost to dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reflected stoically that everything decays wears out in this world that the way of kindness should be made easy to the well disposed that her daughter winnie was a most devoted sister and a very self confident wife indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as regards winnies sisterly devotion her stoicism flinched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she excepted that sentiment from the rule of decay affecting all things human and some things divine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could not help it not to do so would have frightened her too much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in considering the conditions of her daughters married state she rejected firmly all flattering illusions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took the cold and reasonable view that the less strain put on mr verlocs kindness the longer its effects were likely to last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that excellent man loved his wife of course but he would no doubt prefer to keep as few of her relations as was consistent with the proper display of that sentiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be better if its whole effect were concentrated on poor stevie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the heroic old woman resolved on going away from her children as an act of devotion and as a move of deep policy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the virtue of this policy consisted in this mrs verlocs mother was subtle in her way that stevies moral claim would be strengthened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor boy a good useful boy if a little peculiar had not a sufficient standing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been taken over with his mother somewhat in the same way as the furniture of the belgravian mansion had been taken over as if on the ground of belonging to her exclusively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what will happen she asked herself for mrs verlocs mother was in a measure imaginative when i die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she asked herself that question it was with dread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was also terrible to think that she would not then have the means of knowing what happened to the poor boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its to be served at small tables in the new english fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> archers eyes lingered a moment on the lefthand pew where his mother who had entered the church on mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry van der luydens arm sat weeping softly under her chantilly veil her hands in her grandmothers ermine muff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought looking at his sister even by screwing her head around she can see only the people in the few front pews and theyre mostly dowdy newlands and dagonets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the hither side of the white ribbon dividing off the seats reserved for the families he saw beaufort tall and redfaced scrutinising the women with his arrogant stare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside him sat his wife all silvery chinchilla and violets and on the far side of the ribbon lawrence leffertss sleekly brushed head seemed to mount guard over the invisible deity of good form who presided at the ceremony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> archer wondered how many flaws leffertss keen eyes would discover in the ritual of his divinity then he suddenly recalled that he too had once thought such questions important <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the things that had filled his days seemed now like a nursery parody of life or like the wrangles of mediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical terms that nobody had ever understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents should be shown had darkened the last hours before the wedding and it seemed inconceivable to archer that grownup people should work themselves into a state of agitation over such trifles and that the matter should have been decided in the negative by mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellands saying with indignant tears i should as soon turn the reporters loose in my house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet there was a time when archer had had definite and rather aggressive opinions on all such problems and when everything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had seemed to him fraught with worldwide significance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the while i suppose he thought real people were living somewhere and real things happening to them there they come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> breathed the best man excitedly but the bridegroom knew better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cautious opening of the door of the church meant only that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brown the liverystable keeper gowned in black in his intermittent character of sexton was taking a preliminary survey of the scene before marshalling his forces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door was softly shut again then after another interval it swung majestically open and a murmur ran through the church the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> welland came first on the arm of her eldest son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her large pink face was appropriately solemn and her plumcoloured satin with pale blue sidepanels and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet met with general approval but before she had settled herself with a stately rustle in the pew opposite mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> archers the spectators were craning their necks to see who was coming after her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wild rumours had been abroad the day before to the effect that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> manson mingott in spite of her physical disabilities had resolved on being present at the ceremony and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting character that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk up the nave and squeeze into a seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was known that she had insisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of taking down the end panel of the front pew and to measure the space between the seat and the front but the result had been discouraging and for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the plan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous bath chair and sitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her relations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person who suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the iron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the curbstone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of doing away with this awning and revealing the bride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood outside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas exceeded even old catherines courage though for a moment she had weighed the possibility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why they might take a photograph of my child and put it in the papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> welland exclaimed when her mothers last plan was hinted to her and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled with a collective shudder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ancestress had had to give in but her concession was bought only by the promise that the wedding breakfast should take place under her roof though as the washington square connection said with the wellands house in easy reach it was hard to have to make a special price with brown to drive one to the other end of nowhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though all these transactions had been widely reported by the jacksons a sporting minority still clung to the belief that old catherine would appear in church and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature when she was found to have been replaced by her daughterinlaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lovell mingott had the high colour and glassy stare induced in ladies of her age and habit by the effort of getting into a new dress but once the disappointment occasioned by her motherinlaws nonappearance had subsided it was agreed that her black chantilly over lilac satin with a bonnet of parma violets formed the happiest contrast to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far different was the impression produced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followed on mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mingotts arm in a wild dishevelment of stripes and fringes and floating scarves and as this last apparition glided into view archers heart contracted and stopped beating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had taken it for granted that the marchioness manson was still in washington where she had gone some four weeks previously with her niece madame olenska <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was generally understood that their abrupt departure was due to madame olenskas desire to remove her aunt from the baleful eloquence of dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agathon carver who had nearly succeeded in enlisting her as a recruit for the valley of love and in the circumstances no one had expected either of the ladies to return for the wedding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment archer stood with his eyes fixed on medoras fantastic figure straining to see who came behind her but the little procession was at an end for all the lesser members of the family had taken their seats and the eight tall ushers gathering themselves together like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre were already slipping through the side doors into the lobby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a long time had apparently passed since his heart had stopped beating for the white and rosy procession was in fact half way up the nave the bishop the rector and two whitewinged assistants were hovering about the flowerbanked altar and the first chords of the spohr symphony were strewing their flowerlike notes before the bride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> archer opened his eyes but could they really have been shut as he imagined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and felt his heart beginning to resume its usual task <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the music the scent of the lilies on the altar the vision of the cloud of tulle and orangeblossoms floating nearer and nearer the sight of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> archers face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs the low benedictory murmur of the rectors voice the ordered evolutions of the eight pink bridesmaids and the eight black ushers all these sights sounds and sensations so familiar in themselves so unutterably strange and meaningless in his new relation to them were confusedly mingled in his brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my god he thought have i got the ring?and once more he went through the bridegrooms convulsive gesture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then in a moment may was beside him such radiance streaming from her that it sent a faint warmth through his numbness and he straightened himself and smiled into her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dearly beloved we are gathered together here the rector began the ring was on her hand the bishops benediction had been given the bridesmaids were apoise to resume their place in the procession and the organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the mendelssohn march without which no newlywedded couple had ever emerged upon new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young newland nervously hissed and once more archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the unknown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was it that had sent him there he wondered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps the glimpse among the anonymous spectators in the transept of a dark coil of hair under a hat which a moment later revealed itself as belonging to an unknown lady with a long nose so laughably unlike the person whose image she had evoked that he asked himself if he were becoming subject to hallucinations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave carried forward on the light mendelssohn ripples the spring day beckoning to them through widely opened doors and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellands chestnuts with big white favours on their frontlets curvetting and showing off at the far end of the canvas tunnel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the footman who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel wrapped mays white cloak about her and archer jumped into the brougham at her side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands clasped under her veil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> archer saidand suddenly the same black abyss yawned before him and he felt himself sinking into it deeper and deeper while his voice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully yes of course i thought id lost the ring no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a bridegroom didnt go through that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you did keep me waiting you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she surprised him by turning in full fifth avenue and flinging her arms about his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but none ever can happen now can it newland as long as we two are together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the young couple after the weddingbreakfast had ample time to put on their travellingclothes descend the wide mingott stairs between laughing bridesmaids and weeping parents and get into the brougham under the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers and there was still half an hour left in which to drive to the station buy the last weeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers and settle themselves in the reserved compartment in which mays maid had already placed her dovecoloured travelling cloak and glaringly new dressingbag from london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old du lac aunts at rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal of the bridal couple with a readiness inspired by the prospect of spending a week in new york with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> archer and archer glad to escape the usual bridal suite in a philadelphia or baltimore hotel had accepted with an equal alacrity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may was enchanted at the idea of going to the country and childishly amused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where their mysterious retreat was situated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was thought very english to have a countryhouse lent to one and the fact gave a last touch of distinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant wedding of the year but where the house was no one was permitted to know except the parents of bride and groom who when taxed with the knowledge pursed their lips and said mysteriously ah they didnt tell us which was manifestly true since there was no need to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in returning to the lodge i felt very happy and thanked god that i had now something to think about something to dwell on as a relief from the weary monotony the lonely drudgery of my present life for i was lonely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never from month to month from year to year except during my brief intervals of rest at home did i see one creature to whom i could open my heart or freely speak my thoughts with any hope of sympathy or even comprehension never one unless it were poor nancy brown with whom i could enjoy a single moment of real social intercourse or whose conversation was calculated to render me better wiser or happier than before or who as far as i could see could be greatly benefited by mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my only companions had been unamiable children and ignorant wrong headed girls from whose fatiguing folly unbroken solitude was often a relief most earnestly desired and dearly prized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to be restricted to such associates was a serious evil both in its immediate effects and the consequences that were likely to ensue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never a new idea or stirring thought came to me from without and such as rose within me were for the most part miserably crushed at once or doomed to sicken or fade away because they could not see the light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> habitual associates are known to exercise a great influence over each others minds and manners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those whose actions are for ever before our eyes whose words are ever in our ears will naturally lead us albeit against our will slowly gradually imperceptibly perhaps to act and speak as they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not presume to say how far this irresistible power of assimilation extends but if one civilised man were doomed to pass a dozen years amid a race of intractable savages unless he had power to improve them i greatly question whether at the close of that period he would not have become at least a barbarian himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i as i could not make my young companions better feared exceedingly that they would make me worse would gradually bring my feelings habits capacities to the level of their own without however imparting to me their lightheartedness and cheerful vivacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already i seemed to feel my intellect deteriorating my heart petrifying my soul contracting and i trembled lest my very moral perceptions should become deadened my distinctions of right and wrong confounded and all my better faculties be sunk at last beneath the baneful influence of such a mode of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gross vapours of earth were gathering around me and closing in upon my inward heaven and thus it was that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston rose at length upon me appearing like the morning star in my horizon to save me from the fear of utter darkness and i rejoiced that i had now a subject for contemplation that was above me not beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was glad to see that all the world was not made up of bloomfields murrays hatfields ashbys c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that human excellence was not a mere dream of the imagination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we hear a little good and no harm of a person it is easy and pleasant to imagine more in short it is needless to analyse all my thoughts but sunday was now become a day of peculiar delight to me i was now almost brokenin to the back corner in the carriage for i liked to hear him and i liked to see him too though i knew he was not handsome or even what is called agreeable in outward aspect but certainly he was not ugly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in stature he was a little a very little above the middle size the outline of his face would be pronounced too square for beauty but to me it announced decision of character his dark brown hair was not carefully curled like mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hatfields but simply brushed aside over a broad white forehead the eyebrows i suppose were too projecting but from under those dark brows there gleamed an eye of singular power brown in colour not large and somewhat deepset but strikingly brilliant and full of expression there was character too in the mouth something that bespoke a man of firm purpose and an habitual thinker and when he smiled but i will not speak of that yet for at the time i mention i had never seen him smile and indeed his general appearance did not impress me with the idea of a man given to such a relaxation nor of such an individual as the cottagers described him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had early formed my opinion of him and in spite of miss murrays objurgations was fully convinced that he was a man of strong sense firm faith and ardent piety but thoughtful and stern and when i found that to his other good qualities was added that of true benevolence and gentle considerate kindness the discovery perhaps delighted me the more as i had not been prepared to expect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next visit i paid to nancy brown was in the second week in march for though i had many spare minutes during the day i seldom could look upon an hour as entirely my own since where everything was left to the caprices of miss matilda and her sister there could be no order or regularity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever occupation i chose when not actually busied about them or their concerns i had as it were to keep my loins girded my shoes on my feet and my staff in my hand for not to be immediately forthcoming when called for was regarded as a grave and inexcusable offence not only by my pupils and their mother but by the very servant who came in breathless haste to call me exclaiming youre to go to the schoolroom directly mum the young ladies is waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this time i was pretty sure of an hour or two to myself for matilda was preparing for a long ride and rosalie was dressing for a dinnerparty at lady ashbys so i took the opportunity of repairing to the widows cottage where i found her in some anxiety about her cat which had been absent all day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i comforted her with as many anecdotes of that animals roving propensities as i could recollect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im feared o th gamekeepers said she thats all at i think on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if th young gentlemen had been at home i should a thought theyd been setting their dogs at her an worried her poor thing as they did many a poor things cat but i havent that to be feared on now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nancys eyes were better but still far from well she had been trying to make a sunday shirt for her son but told me she could only bear to do a little bit at it now and then so that it progressed but slowly though the poor lad wanted it sadly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i proposed to help her a little after i had read to her for i had plenty of time that evening and need not return till dusk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an youll be a bit o company for me too miss said she i like as i feel lonesome without my cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when i had finished reading and done the half of a seam with nancys capacious brass thimble fitted on to my finger by means of a roll of paper i was disturbed by the entrance of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston with the identical cat in his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i now saw that he could smile and very pleasantly too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive done you a piece of good service nancy he began then seeing me he acknowledged my presence by a slight bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have been invisible to hatfield or any other gentleman of those parts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yonder further away the mountains tower up in an amphitheatre ever bluer and mistier and at the edge of the horizon stretches the silver chain of snowclad summits begin ning with kazbek and ending with twopeaked elbruz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a feeling akin to rapture is diffused through all my veins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air is pure and fresh like the kiss of a child the sun is bright the sky is blue what more could one possibly wish for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what need in such a place as this of passions desires regrets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the last cloud of an expiring storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will go to the elizaveta spring i am told that the whole society of the wateringplace assembles there in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> descending into the middle of the town i walked along the boulevard on which i met a few melancholy groups slowly ascending the moun tain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these for the most part were the families of landedgentry from the steppes as could be guessed at once from the threadbare old fashioned frockcoats of the husbands and the exquisite attire of the wives and daughters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently they already had all the young men of the wateringplace at their fingers ends because they looked at me with a tender curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the petersburg cut of my coat misled them but they soon recognised the military epaulettes and turned away with indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wives of the local authorities the host esses so to speak of the waters were more graciously inclined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they carry lorgnettes and they pay less attention to a uniform they have grown accustomed in the caucasus to meeting a fervid heart beneath a numbered button and a cultured intellect beneath a white foragecap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these ladies are very charming and long continue to be charming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each year their adorers are exchanged for new ones and in that very fact it may be lies the secret of their unwearying amiability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ascending by the narrow path to the elizaveta spring i overtook a crowd of officials and military men who as i subsequently learned compose a class apart amongst those who place their hopes in the medicinal waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they drink but not water take but few walks indulge in only mild flirtations gamble and complain of boredom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in letting their wicker sheathed tumblers down into the well of sulphur ous water they assume academical poses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the officials wear bright blue cravats the military men have ruffs sticking out above their collars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they affect a profound contempt for provincial ladies and sigh for the aristocratic drawingrooms of the capitals to which they are not admitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the small square adjoining it a little house with a red roof over the bath is erected and somewhat further on there is a gallery in which the people walk when it rains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some wounded officers were sitting pale and melancholy on a bench with their crutches drawn up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few ladies their tumbler of water finished were walking with rapid steps to and fro about the square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were two or three pretty faces amongst them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath the avenues of the vines with which the slope of mashuk is covered occasional glimpses could be caught of the gaycoloured hat of a lover of solitude for two for beside that hat i always noticed either a military foragecap or the ugly round hat of a civilian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the steep cliff where the pavilion called the aeolian harp is erected figured the lovers of scenery directing their telescopes upon elbruz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amongst them were a couple of tutors with their pupils who had come to be cured of scrofula <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of breath i came to a standstill at the edge of the mountain and leaning against the corner of a little house i began to examine the picturesque surroundings when suddenly i heard behind me a familiar voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had made his acquaintance in the active service detachment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been wounded in the foot by a bullet and had come to the waters a week or so before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grushnitski is a cadet he has only been a year in the service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from a kind of foppery peculiar to himself he wears the thick cloak of a common soldier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has also the soldiers cross of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is well built swarthy and black haired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to look at him you might say he was a man of twentyfive although he is scarcely twentyone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tosses his head when he speaks and keeps continually twirling his moustache with his left hand his right hand being occupied with the crutch on which he leans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he speaks rapidly and affectedly he is one of those people who have a highsounding phrase ready for every occasion in life who remain untouched by simple beauty and who drape themselves majestically in extraordinary sentiments exalted passions and exceptional sufferings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to produce an effect is their delight they have an almost insensate fondness for romantic provincial ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when old age approaches they become either peaceful landedgentry or drunkards sometimes both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frequently they have many good qualities but they have not a grain of poetry in their com position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would deluge you with words so soon as the conversation went beyond the sphere of ordinary ideas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never been able to dispute with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he neither answers your questions nor listens to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so soon as you stop he begins a lengthy tirade which has the appearance of being in some sort connected with what you have been saying but which is in fact only a continuation of his own harangue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is witty enough his epigrams are fre quently amusing but never malicious nor to the point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slays nobody with a single word he has no knowledge of men and of their foibles because all his life he has been interested in nobody but himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his aim is to make himself the hero of a novel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has so often endeavoured to convince others that he is a being created not for this world and doomed to certain mysterious sufferings that he has almost convinced himself that such he is in reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence the pride with which he wears his thick soldiers cloak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen through him and he dislikes me for that reason although to outward appearance we are on the friendliest of terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grushnitski is looked upon as a man of distinguished courage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waves his sabre shouts and hurls himself forward with his eyes shut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is not what i should call russian courage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel that some time or other we shall come into collision upon a narrow road and that one of us will fare badly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his arrival in the caucasus is also the result of his romantic fanaticism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am convinced that on the eve of his departure from his paternal village he said with an air of gloom to some pretty neighbour that he was going away not so much for the simple purpose of serving in the army as of seeking death because and hereupon i am sure he covered his eyes with his hand and continued thus no you or thou must not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the palace was finished the next day and the genie carried him there and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out even to the laying of a velvet carpet from aladdins palace to the sultans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aladdins mother then dressed herself carefully and walked to the palace with her slaves while he followed her on horseback <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sultan sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to meet them so that the air resounded with music and cheers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd better unless you want to see your child just dry up into a miserable old maid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes still young and she has a chance for happiness if she had a father that didnt bring a millstone to hang around her neck instead of what he ought to give her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you just wait till you die and god asks you what you had in your breast instead of a heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats my heart got to do with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent got one or youd give her what she needed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this he sat suddenly rigid his troubled hands ceasing to rub his knees and he looked at her fixedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean youve broken your word never to speak of that to me again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried and sinking to the floor at his feet rocked herself back and forth there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you suppose ill let my word keep me from struggling for a little happiness for my children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will till i die till i die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rubbed his head now instead of his knees and shaking all over he got up and began with uncertain steps to pace the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes thats what you been after all the time i was getting well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i have and ill keep on till i die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fine wife for a man he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beggin a man to be a dirty dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be a manand ill keep on till i die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adams again fell back upon his last solace he walked half staggering up and down the room swearing in a rhythmic repetition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife had repetitions of her own and she kept at them in a voice that rose to a higher and higher pitch like the sound of an old wellpump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ended in a scream and alice coming up the stairs thanked heaven that russell had gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ran to her fathers door and went in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adams looked at her and gesticulated shakily at the convulsive figure on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adams to her feet and the stricken woman threw her arms passionately about her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alice moving toward the door halted and looked at him blankly over her mothers shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stretched out his arm and pointed at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saysshe says you have a mean life alice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> couldnt you be as brave as she is virgil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> things like this dance nowis that so hard to bear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alice tried to say no papa again but she couldnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly and in spite of herself she began to cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now do you he waved at them fiercely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they went he dropped in his chair and bent far forward so that his haggard face was concealed from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as alice closed the door he began to rub his knees again muttering oh my my <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there shone a jovial sun overhead on the appointed day after tomorrow a day not cool yet of a temperature friendly to walkers and the air powdered with sunshine had so much life in it that it seemed to sparkle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to arthur russell this was a day like a gay companion who pleased him well but the gay companion at his side pleased him even better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked her prettiest chattered her wittiest smiled her wistfulest and delighted him with all together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you look so happy its easy to see your fathers taken a good turn he told her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he has this afternoon at least she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might have other reasons for looking cheerful though <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said giving him a sweet look just enough mocked by her laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this style which uses a word for any meaning that quick look and colourful gesture care to endow it with she was an expert and she carried it merrily on leaving him at liberty one of the great values of the style to choose as he would how much or how little she meant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was content to supply mere cues for although he had little coquetry of his own he had lately begun to find that the only interesting moments in his life were those during which alice adams coquetted with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> happily these obliging moments extended themselves to cover all the time he spent with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however serious she might seem whatever appeared to be her topic all was thouandi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he planned for more of it seeing otherwise a dull evening ahead and reverted afterwhile to a forbidden subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about that dance at miss lambs since your fathers so much better she flushed a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we agreed not to say any more about that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but since he is better alice shook her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he always has a bad day after a good one especially after such a good one as this is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if this time it should be different russell persisted wouldnt you be willing to come if hes better by tomorrow evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not wait and decide at the last minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what does it matter whether poor little alice adams goes to a dance or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i thought id made it clear that it looks fairly bleak to me if you dont go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care a great deal about dances these days and if you arent going to be there you could stay away she suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid im supposed to be the excuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss lamb in her capacity as a friend of my relatives oh shes giving it for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that his face showed an increase of colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose just on account of my being a cousin of mildreds and of of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henriettall see that you have somebody to dance with besides miss dowling poor man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what i want somebody to see is that i dance with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said frowning as if she debated whether or not to tell him something of import then seeming to decide affirmatively she asked would you really like to know the truth about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it hasnt anything to do with you at all she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course id like to go with you and to dance with youthough you dont seem to realize that you wouldnt be permitted much time with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that far back year when he had wooed her with the sweet words she taught him he had not looked more manly and attractive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a perverse disposition in women to love personal prowess and to adore the heroes of the battlefield and never had the senora loved her husband as she did at that hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his capacity of physician he had done unnoticed deeds of far greater braverygone into a comanche camp that was being devastated by smallpoxor galloped fifty miles alone in the night through woods haunted by savage men and beasts to succor some little child struggling with croup or some frontiersman pierced with an arrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the senora had always fretted and scolded a little when he thus exposed his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though she could not bring herself to approve the cause for which he fought she was as sensitive as men and women always are to victorious valor and a successful cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing but the express orders of fray ignatius to remain where she was prevented her leaving the worths for the freedom so suddenly given to isabel had filled her with indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was longing to be in some house where she could give adequate expression to the diabolical temper she felt it right to indulge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the afternoon it was some relief to see the confessor coming up the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked as the mournful jeremiah may have looked when he had the burden of a heavy prophecy to deliver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the senora sat down with a doggedly sullen air which antonia understood very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it meant i am not to be forced to take any way but my own today and the wise priest understood her mood as soon as he entered the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put behind him the reproof he had been meditating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stimulated her curiosity he asked her sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no man knew better than fray ignatius when to assume sacerdotal authority and when to lay it aside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the senora was never proof against the compliment of his personal friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fight as it affected himself and his brotherhood and the convent was full of interest to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she smiled at brother servandos childish alarm she was angry at an insult offered to the venerable abbot she condoled with the sisters wept at the danger that the famous statue of the virgin de los reinedias had been exposed to and was altogether as sympathetic as he could desire until her own affairs were mentioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sword has pierced your heart too i am sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to know that your husband and sons were fighting against your god and your country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for your comfort i tell you that the saints who have suffered a fiery martyrdom stand at the feet of those who like you endure the continual crucifixion of their affections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the senora was silent but not displeased and the priest then but there is an end to all trials daughter and i now absolve you from the further struggle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> decide this day for your god and your country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> make an offering to almighty god and the holy mother of your earthly love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give yourself and your daughters and all that you have to the benign and merciful church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> show these rebels and hereticsthese ungrateful recipients of mexican bountywhat a true catholic is capable of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his divine majesty and the holy mary demand this supreme sacrifice from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father i have my husband and my sons to them also i owe some duties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> listen then if it is your right hand or your right eye that is if it is your husband or your childyou are commanded to give them up orit is gods wordthere is only hell fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked with the terror of a child into the dark cruel face of the priest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as immovably stern as if carved out of stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then her eyes sought those of antonia who sat at a distant window with her embroidery in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she let it fall when her mothers pitiful uncertain glance asked from her strength and counsel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had the tall fair girl looked so noble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sorrowful majesty that had something in it of pity and something of anger gave to her countenance her movements and even her speech a kind of authority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear mother do as the beloved and kindhearted ruth did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like you she married one not of her race and not of her religion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even when god had taken him from her she chose to remain with his peopleto leave her own people and abide with his mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this act god blessed her and all nations in all ages have honored her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what has ruth to do with the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth was a heathen womana moabitea race ten times accursed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth was the ancestress of our blessed saviour and of the virgin mary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has not been to confession for nine months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every day twice a day i confess my sins humbly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hear indeed that you read wicked bookseven upon your knees you read them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could a child like you read the bible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a book for bishops and archbishops and the immaculate father himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what an insolence of selfconceit must possess so young a heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl stood with burning cheeks gazing at the proud passionate man but she did not obey his order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see you with your own eyes the fruit of your sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you dare to become a partner in such wickedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go at once and bring here this wicked book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how can you make so miserable a mother who loves you so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few moments antonia returned with the objectionable book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear grandmother gave it to me she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look mi madre here is my name in her writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it conceivable that she would give to your antonia a book that she ought not to read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the senora took it in her hands and turned the leaves very much as a child might turn those of a book in an unknown tongue in which there were no illustrations nor anything that looked the least interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a pretty volume of moderate size bound in purple morocco and fastened with gilt clasps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see the word god in it very often fray ignatius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a heretic bible i am sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could anything be more sinful more disrespectful to god more dangerous for a young girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as he said the words he took it from the senoras listless hands glanced at the obnoxious titlepage and then stepping hastily to the hearth flung the book upon the burning logs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a cry of horror pain amazement all blended antonia sprang towards the fire but fray ignatius stood with outstretched arms before it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to save your soul from eternal fires i burn the book that has misled you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and sobbing and crying out in her fear and anger she fled down stairs and called the peon ortiz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know where to find the senor doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you do ortiz take the swiftest horse and bring him here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man looked with anger into the girls troubled face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he was something unlike himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can find him i will bring him in fifteen minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> corpus christi it is here he should be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at bottom you really like all these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the same life runs smoothly enough with some people and with me its always a messy sort of patchwork <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its like the song peace is where i am not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can you face it all with so much fortitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with that clear gaze which wilson had so much admired which he had felt implied such high confidence and fearless pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i faced that long ago when you were on your first bridge up at old allway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew then that your paths were not to be paths of peace but i decided that i wanted to follow them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bartley and his wife stood silent for a long time the fire crackled in the grate the rain beat insistently upon the windows and the sleepy angora looked up at them curiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently thomas made a discreet sound at the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him not to forget the big portfolio on the study table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bartley turned away from his wife still holding her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they both started at the sound of the carriage on the pavement outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexander sat down and leaned his head on his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thomas brought him his hat and stick and ulster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sight of these the supercilious angora moved restlessly quitted her red cushion by the fire and came up waving her tail in vexation at these ominous indications of change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexander stooped to stroke her and then plunged into his coat and drew on his gloves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill work like the devil winifred and be home again before you realize ive gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kissed her quickly several times hurried out of the front door into the rain and waved to her from the carriage window as the driver was starting his melancholy dripping black horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexander sat with his hands clenched on his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the carriage turned up the hill he lifted one hand and brought it down violently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this timehe spoke aloud and through his set teeth this time im going to end it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the afternoon of the third day out alexander was sitting well to the stern on the windward side where the chairs were few his rugs over him and the collar of his furlined coat turned up about his ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the weather had so far been dark and raw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for two hours he had been watching the low dirty sky and the beating of the heavy rain upon the ironcolored sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a long oily swell that made exercise laborious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the decks smelled of damp woolens and the air was so humid that drops of moisture kept gathering upon his hair and mustache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seldom moved except to brush them away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great open spaces made him passive and the restlessness of the water quieted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it tells the day of the why should it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does your watch tell of course not alice replied very readily but thats which is just the case with mine said the hatter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hatters remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont quite understand you she said as politely as she could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to have you guessed the riddle yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent the slightest idea said the hatter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you i dont know what you mean said alice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hatter said tossing his head perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep is that the way you manage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after all they were women first and queens afterwards and therefore not devoid of curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they passed to their seats i saw both of them glance swiftly in our direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw too that their eyes passed by me seeing nothing to charm them in the person of an insignificant and grizzled old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they looked with evident astonishment on the grim form of old umslopogaas who raised his axe in salutation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> attracted next by the splendour of goods apparel for a second their glance rested on him like a humming moth upon a flower then off it darted to where sir henry curtis stood the sunlight from a window playing upon his yellow hair and peaked beard and marking the outlines of his massive frame against the twilight of the somewhat gloomy hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raised his eyes and they met the fair nylepthas full and thus for the first time the goodliest man and woman that it has ever been my lot to see looked one upon another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and why it was i know not but i saw the swift blood run up nylepthas skin as the pink lights run up the morning sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> red grew her fair bosom and shapely arm red the swanlike neck the rounded cheeks blushed red as the petals of a rose and then the crimson flood sank back to whence it came and left her pale and trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he too had coloured up to the eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thought i to myself the ladies have come on the stage and now we may look to the plot to develop itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i sighed and shook my head knowing that the beauty of a woman is like the beauty of the lightninga destructive thing and a cause of desolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time that i had finished my reflections both the queens were on the thrones for all this had happened in about six seconds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more the unseen trumpets blared out and then the court seated itself and queen sorais motioned to us to do likewise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next from among the crowd whither he had withdrawn stepped forward our guide the old gentleman who had towed us ashore holding by the hand the girl whom we had seen first and afterwards rescued from the hippopotamus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having made obeisance he proceeded to address the queens evidently describing to them the way and place where we had been found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was most amusing to watch the astonishment not unmixed with fear reflected upon their faces as they listened to his tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clearly they could not understand how we had reached the lake and been found floating on it and were inclined to attribute our presence to supernatural causes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the narrative proceeded as i judged from the frequent appeals that our guide made to the girl to the point where we had shot the hippopotami and we at once perceived that there was something very wrong about those hippopotami for the history was frequently interrupted by indignant exclamations from the little group of whiterobed priests and even from the courtiers while the two queens listened with an amazed expression especially when our guide pointed to the rifles in our hands as being the means of destruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here to make matters clear i may as well explain at once that the inhabitants of zuvendis are sunworshippers and that for some reason or another the hippopotamus is sacred among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that they do not kill it because at a certain season of the year they slaughter thousandswhich are specially preserved in large lakes up the countryand use their hides for armour for soldiers but this does not prevent them from considering these animals as sacred to the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr quatermain does not seem to have been aware that it is common for animalworshipping people to annually sacrifice the beasts they adore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now as ill luck would have it the particular hippopotami we had shot were a family of tame animals that were kept in the mouth of the port and daily fed by priests whose special duty it was to attend to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we shot them i thought that the brutes were suspiciously tame and this was as we afterwards ascertained the cause of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus it came about that in attempting to show off we had committed sacrilege of a most aggravated nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when our guide had finished his tale the old man with the long beard and round cap whose appearance i have already described and who was as i have said the high priest of the country and known by the name of agon rose and commenced an impassioned harangue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not like the look of his cold grey eye as he fixed it on us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have liked it still less had i known that in the name of the outraged majesty of his god he was demanding that the whole lot of us should be offered up as a sacrifice by means of being burnt alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after he had finished speaking the queen sorais addressed him in a soft and musical voice and appeared to judge from his gestures of dissent to be putting the other side of the question before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little did we know that she was pleading for our lives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally she turned and addressed a tall soldierlike man of middle age with a black beard and a long plain sword whose name as we afterwards learnt was nasta and who was the greatest lord in the country apparently appealing to him for support <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now when sir henry had caught her eye and she had blushed so rosy red i had seen that the incident had not escaped this mans notice and what is more that it was eminently disagreeable to him for he bit his lip and his hand tightened on his swordhilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwards we learnt that he was an aspirant for the hand of this queen in marriage which accounted for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this being so nyleptha could not have appealed to a worse person for speaking in slow heavy tones he appeared to confirm all that the high priest agon had said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he spoke sorais put her elbow on her knee and resting her chin on her hand looked at him with a suppressed smile upon her lips as though she saw through the man and was determined to be his match but nyleptha grew very angry her cheek flushed her eyes flashed and she did indeed look lovely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally she turned to agon and seemed to give some sort of qualified assent for he bowed at her words and as she spoke she moved her hands as though to emphasize what she said while all the time sorais kept her chin on her hand and smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly nyleptha made a sign the trumpets blew again and everybody rose to leave the hall save ourselves and the guards whom she motioned to stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were all gone she bent forward and smiling sweetly partially by signs and partially by exclamations made it clear to us that she was very anxious to know where we came from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the difficulty was how to explain but at last an idea struck me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had my large pocketbook in my pocket and a pencil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking it out i made a little sketch of a lake and then as best i could i drew the underground river and the lake at the other end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i had done this i advanced to the steps of the throne and gave it to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she understood it at once and clapped her hands with delight and then descending from the throne took it to her sister sorais who also evidently understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next she took the pencil from me and after examining it with curiosity proceeded to make a series of delightful little sketches the first representing herself holding out both hands in welcome and a man uncommonly like sir henry taking them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next she drew a lovely little picture of a hippopotamus rolling about dying in the water and of an individual in whom we had no difficulty in recognizing agon the high priest holding up his hands in horror on the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then followed a most alarming picture of a dreadful fiery furnace and of the same figure agon poking us into it with a forked stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this picture perfectly horrified me but i was a little reassured when she nodded sweetly and proceeded to make a fourth drawinga man again uncommonly like sir henry and of two women in whom i recognized sorais and herself each with one arm around him and holding a sword in protection over him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to all of these sorais who i saw was employed in carefully taking us all inespecially curtissignified her approval by nodding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last nyleptha drew a final sketch of a rising sun indicating that she must go and that we should meet on the following morning whereat sir henry looked so disappointed that she saw it and i suppose by way of consolation extended her hand to him to kiss which he did with pious fervour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time sorais off whom good had never taken his eyeglass during the whole indaba interview rewarded him by giving him her hand to kiss though while she did so her eyes were fixed upon sir henry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am glad to say that i was not implicated in these proceedings neither of them gave me her hand to kiss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then nyleptha turned and addressed the man who appeared to be in command of the bodyguard apparently from her manner and his frequent obeisances giving him very stringent and careful orders after which with a somewhat coquettish nod and smile she left the hall followed by sorais and most of the guards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the queens had gone the officer whom nyleptha had addressed came forward and with many tokens of deep respect led us from the hall through various passages to a sumptuous set of apartments opening out of a large central room lighted with brazen swinging lamps for it was now dusk and richly carpeted and strewn with couches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a table in the centre of the room was set a profusion of food and fruit and what is more flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a delicious wine also in ancientlooking sealed earthenware flagons and beautifully chased golden and ivory cups to drink it from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> servants male and female also were there to minister to the silver lute did speak between and altogether we found ourselves in a sort of earthly paradise which was only disturbed by the vision of that disgusting high priest who intended to commit us to the flames <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but so very weary were we with our labours that we could scarcely keep ourselves awake through the sumptuous meal and as soon as it was over we indicated that we desired to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a further precaution against surprise we left umslopogaas with his axe to sleep in the main chamber near the curtained doorways leading to the apartments which we occupied respectively good and i in the one and sir henry and alphonse in the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then throwing off our clothes with the exception of the mail shirts which we considered it safer to keep on we flung ourselves down upon the low and luxurious couches and drew the silkembroidered coverlids over us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in two minutes i was just dropping off when i was aroused by goods voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had reached the period of life he had long since reached when after separations the marked clockface of the friend we meet announces the hour we have tried to forget <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he couldnt have said what he expected as at the end of his waiting he turned the corner where for years he had always paused simply not to pause was a efficient cause for emotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an event somehow and in all their long acquaintance there had never been an event <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this one grew larger when five minutes later in the faint elegance of her little drawingroom she quavered out a greeting that showed the measure she took of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a strange sense of having come for something in particular strange because literally there was nothing particular between them nothing save that they were at one on their great point which had long ago become a magnificent matter of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was true that after she had said you can always come now you know the thing he was there for seemed already to have happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked her if it was the death of her aunt that made the difference to which she replied she never knew i knew you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beautiful clearness of her candour her faded beauty was like a summer twilight disconnected the words from any image of deceit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they might have struck him as the record of a deep dissimulation but she had always given him a sense of noble reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vanished aunt was present as he looked about him in the small complacencies of the room the beaded velvet and the fluted moreen and though as we know he had the worship of the dead he found himself not definitely regretting this lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mare and her color was a coincidenceluckily she was only a bayand i fancied the condition of the beast must have told a tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im inclined to think he suspected something though not the right thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wasnt expecting him and i fear my appearance may have increased his suspicions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to have rather a heavy moustache said raffles but i lost it the day after i lost my innocence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the various robberies in which we were both concerned it is but the few i find that will bear telling at any length <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that the others contained details which even i would hesitate to recount it is rather the very absence of untoward incident which renders them useless for my present purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in point of fact our plans were so craftily laid by raffles that the chances of a hitch were invariably reduced to a minimum before we went to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we might be disappointed in the market value of our haul but it was quite the exception for us to find ourselves confronted by unforeseen impediments or involved in a really dramatic dilemma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a sameness even in our spoil for of course only the most precious stones are worth the trouble we took and the risks we ran <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short our most successful escapades would prove the greatest weariness of all in narrative form and none more so than the dull affair of the ardagh emeralds some eight or nine weeks after the milchester cricket week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the former however had a sequel that i would rather forget than all our burglaries put together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the evening after our return from ireland and i was waiting at my rooms for raffles who had gone off as usual to dispose of the plunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raffles had his own method of conducting this very vital branch of our business which i was well content to leave entirely in his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drove the bargains i believe in a thin but subtle disguise of the flashyseedy order and always in the cockney dialect of which he had made himself a master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover he invariably employed the same fence who was ostensibly a moneylender in a small but yet notorious way and in reality a rascal as remarkable as raffles himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only lately i also had been to the man but in my proper person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had needed capital for the getting of these very emeralds and i had raised a hundred pounds on the terms you would expect from a softspoken graybeard with an ingratiating smile an incessant bow and the shiftiest old eyes that ever flew from rim to rim of a pair of spectacles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the original sinews and the final spoils of war came in this case from the selfsame sourcea circumstance which appealed to us both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but these same final spoils i was still to see and i waited and waited with an impatience that grew upon me with the growing dusk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at my open window i had played sister ann until the faces in the street below were no longer distinguishable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now i was tearing to and fro in the grip of horrible hypothesesa grip that tightened when at last the liftgates opened with a clatter outsidethat held me breathless until a wellknown tattoo followed on my door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothingnow youve come said i shutting the door behind him in a fever of relief and anxiety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know what a stew ive been in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been thinking of you and nothing else for the last hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ii was ass enough to think something had gone wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raffles was smiling when the white light filled the room but for the moment i did not perceive the peculiarity of his smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was fatuously full of my own late tremors and present relief and my first idiotic act was to spill some whiskey and squirt the sodawater all over in my anxiety to do instant justice to the occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said raffles leaning back in my chair as he lit a cigarette and looking much amused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was nothing of the slightest consequence and its all over now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stern chase and a long one bunny but i think im well to windward this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and suddenly i saw that his collar was limp his hair matted his boots thick with dust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but wasnt it baird who took the emeralds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear fellow ill tell you if you give me a chance its really nothing to get in the least excited about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old baird has at last spotted that im not quite the common cracksman i would have him think me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so hes been doing his best to run me to my burrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be something if he had succeeded but he has still to do that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i admit however that he made me sit up for the time being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it all comes of going on the job so far from home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the old brute with the whole thing in his morning paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked doubtless while he played his eternal nippers over gothic glooms sufficiently rapt in reverence but what his thought had finally bumped against was the question of where among packed accumulations so multiform a wedge would be able to enter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were seventy volumes in redandgold to be perhaps what he should most substantially have to show at woollett as the fruit of his mission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a possibility that held him a minuteheld him till he happened to feel that some one unnoticed had approached him and paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turning he saw that a lady stood there as for a greeting and he sprang up as he next took her securely for madame de vionnet who appeared to have recognised him as she passed near him on her way to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she checked quickly and gaily a certain confusion in him came to meet it turned it back by an art of her own the confusion having threatened him as he knew her for the person he had lately been observing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was the lurking figure of the dim chapel she had occupied him more than she guessed but it came to him in time luckily that he neednt tell her and that no harm after all had been done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she herself for that matter straightway showing she felt their encounter as the happiest of accidents had for him a you come here too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i love this place but im terrible in general for churches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old women who live in them all know me in fact im already myself one of the old women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its like that at all events that i foresee i shall end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking about for a chair so that he instantly pulled one nearer she sat down with him again to the sound of an oh i like so much your also being fond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he confessed the extent of his feeling though she left the object vague and he was struck with the tact the taste of her vagueness which simply took for granted in him a sense of beautiful things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was conscious of how much it was affected this sense by something subdued and discreet in the way she had arranged herself for her special object and her morning walkhe believed her to have come on foot the way her slightly thicker veil was drawna mere touch but everything the composed gravity of her dress in which here and there a dull winecolour seemed to gleam faintly through black the charming discretion of her small compact head the quiet note as she sat of her folded greygloved hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was to strethers mind as if she sat on her own ground the light honours of which at an open gate she thus easily did him while all the vastness and mystery of the domain stretched off behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when people were so completely in possession they could be extraordinarily civil and our friend had indeed at this hour a kind of revelation of her heritage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was romantic for him far beyond what she could have guessed and again he found his small comfort in the conviction that subtle though she was his impression must remain a secret from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing that once more made him uneasy for secrets in general was this particular patience she could have with his own want of colour albeit that on the other hand his uneasiness pretty well dropped after he had been for ten minutes as colourless as possible and at the same time as responsive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moments had already for that matter drawn their deepest tinge from the special interest excited in him by his vision of his companions identity with the person whose attitude before the glimmering altar had so impressed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this attitude fitted admirably into the stand he had privately taken about her connexion with chad on the last occasion of his seeing them together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it helped him to stick fast at the point he had then reached it was there he had resolved that he would stick and at no moment since had it seemed as easy to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unassailably innocent was a relation that could make one of the parties to it so carry herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it wasnt innocent why did she haunt the churches?into which given the woman he could believe he made out she would never have come to flaunt an insolence of guilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she haunted them for continued help for strength for peacesublime support which if one were able to look at it so she found from day to day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they talked in low easy tones and with lifted lingering looks about the great monument and its history and its beautyall of which madame de vionnet professed came to her most in the other the outer view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well presently after we go she said walk round it again if you like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not in a particular hurry and it will be pleasant to look at it well with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had spoken of the great romancer and the great romance and of what to his imagination they had done for the whole mentioning to her moreover the exorbitance of his purchase the seventy blazing volumes that were so out of proportion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet he felt even as he spoke how at that instant he was plunging <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had made up his mind and was impatient to get into the air for his purpose was a purpose to be uttered outside and he had a fear that it might with delay still slip away from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she however took her time she drew out their quiet gossip as if she had wished to profit by their meeting and this confirmed precisely an interpretation of her manner of her mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while she rose as he would have called it to the question of victor hugo her voice itself the light low quaver of her deference to the solemnity about them seemed to make her words mean something that they didnt mean openly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> help strength peace a sublime supportshe hadnt found so much of these things as that the amount wouldnt be sensibly greater for any scrap his appearance of faith in her might enable her to feel in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every little in a long strain helped and if he happened to affect her as a firm object she could hold on by he wouldnt jerk himself out of her reach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people in difficulties held on by what was nearest and he was perhaps after all not further off than sources of comfort more abstract <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as to this he had made up his mind he had made it up that is to give her a sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sign would be thatthough it was her own affairhe understood the sign would be thatthough it was her own affairshe was free to clutch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since she took him for a firm objectmuch as he might to his own sense appear at times to rockhe would do his best to be one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the end of it was that half an hour later they were seated together for an early luncheon at a wonderful a delightful house of entertainment on the left banka place of pilgrimage for the knowing they were both aware the knowing who came for its great renown the homage of restless days from the other end of the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strether had already been there three timesfirst with miss gostrey then with chad then with chad again and with waymarsh and little bilham all of whom he had himself sagaciously entertained and his pleasure was deep now on learning that madame de vionnet hadnt yet been initiated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had said as they strolled round the church by the river acting at last on what within he had made up his mind to will you if you have time come to dejeuner with me somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance if you know it over there on the other side which is so easy a walkand then had named the place when he had done this she stopped short as for quick intensity and yet deep difficulty of response <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took in the proposal as if it were almost too charming to be true and there had perhaps never yet been for her companion so unexpected a moment of prideso fine so odd a case at any rate as his finding himself thus able to offer to a person in such universal possession a new a rare amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had heard of the happy spot but she asked him in reply to a further question how in the world he could suppose her to have been there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he supposed himself to have supposed that chad might have taken her and she guessed this the next moment to his no small discomfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah let me explain she smiled that i dont go about with him in public i never have such chancesnot having them otherwise and its just the sort of thing that as a quiet creature living in my hole i adore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was more than kind of him to have thought of itthough frankly if he asked whether she had time she hadnt a single minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that however made no differenceshed throw everything over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every duty at home domestic maternal social awaited her but it was a case for a high line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her affairs would go to smash but hadnt one a right to ones snatch of scandal when one was prepared to pay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on this pleasant basis of costly disorder consequently that they eventually seated themselves on either side of a small table at a window adjusted to the busy quay and the shining bargeburdened seine where for an hour in the matter of letting himself go of diving deep strether was to feel he had touched bottom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was to feel many things on this occasion and one of the first of them was that he had travelled far since that evening in london before the theatre when his dinner with maria gostrey between the pinkshaded candles had struck him as requiring so many explanations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had at that time gathered them in the explanationshe had stored them up but it was at present as if he had either soared above or sunk below themhe couldnt tell which he could somehow think of none that didnt seem to leave the appearance of collapse and cynicism easier for him than lucidity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could he wish it to be lucid for others for any one that he for the hour saw reasons enough in the mere way the bright clean ordered waterside life came in at the open window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mere way madame de vionnet opposite him over their intensely white tablelinen their omelette aux tomates their bottle of strawcoloured chablis thanked him for everything almost with the smile of a child while her grey eyes moved in and out of their talk back to the quarter of the warm spring air in which early summer had already begun to throb and then back again to his face and their human questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their human questions became many before they had donemany more as one after the other came up than our friends free fancy had at all foreseen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sense he had had before the sense he had had repeatedly the sense that the situation was running away with him had never been so sharp as now and all the more that he could perfectly put his finger on the moment it had taken the bit in its teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that accident had definitely occurred the other evening after chads dinner it had occurred as he fully knew at the moment when he interposed between this lady and her child when he suffered himself so to discuss with her a matter closely concerning them that her own subtlety marked by its significant thank you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he had held off for ten days but the situation had continued out of hand in spite of that the fact that it was running so fast being indeed just why he had held off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what had come over him as he recognised her in the nave of the church was that holding off could be but a losing game from the instant she was worked for not only by her subtlety but by the hand of fate itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if all the accidents were to fight on her sideand by the actual showing they loomed largehe could only give himself up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was what he had done in privately deciding then and there to propose she should breakfast with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what did the success of his proposal in fact resemble but the smash in which a regular runaway properly ends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the smash was their walk their dejeuner their omelette the chablis the place the view their present talk and his present pleasure in itto say nothing wonder of wonders of her own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this tune and nothing less accordingly was his surrender made good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it sufficiently lighted up at least the folly of holding off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ancient proverbs sounded for his memory in the tone of their words and the clink of their glasses in the hum of the town and the plash of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was clearly better to suffer as a sheep than as a lamb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one might as well perish by the sword as by famine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marias still away?that was the first thing she had asked him and when he had found the frankness to be cheerful about it in spite of the meaning he knew her to attach to miss gostreys absence she had gone on to enquire if he didnt tremendously miss her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were reasons that made him by no means sure yet he nevertheless answered tremendously which she took in as if it were all she had wished to prove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a man in trouble must be possessed somehow of a woman she said if she doesnt come in one way she comes in another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do you call me a man in trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah because thats the way you strike me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spoke ever so gently and as if with all fear of wounding him while she sat partaking of his bounty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt himself colour at the question and then hated thathated to pass for anything so idiotic as woundable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woundable by chads lady in respect to whom he had come out with such a fund of indifferencewas he already at that point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perversely none the less his pause gave a strange air of truth to her supposition and what was he in fact but disconcerted at having struck her just in the way he had most dreamed of not doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not in trouble yet he at last smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a woman who between courses could be graceful with her elbows on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newsome but it was easy for a femme du monde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a question you put to me he presently returned the night of chads dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt answer it then and it has been very handsome of you not to have sought an occasion for pressing me about it since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i know what you allude to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked you what you had meant by saying the day you came to see me just before you left me that youd save me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you then said at our friendsthat youd have really to wait to see for yourself what you did mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it sounds now as you put it like a very ridiculous speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it does sound ridiculous why do you deny that youre in trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah if i were he replied it wouldnt be the trouble of fearing ridicule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its precisely that it fully comes to me at present that ive kept you long enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know by this time at any rate what i meant by my speech and i really knew it the night of chads dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had already at that moment done something for you in the sense of what i had said the day i went to see you but i wasnt then sure of the importance i might represent this as having <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i see that practically ive done for youhad done for you when you put me your questionall that its as yet possible to me to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel now he went on that it may go further than i thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i did after my visit to you he explained was to write straight off to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newsome about you and im at last from one day to the other expecting her answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its this answer that will represent as i believe the consequences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seethe consequences of your speaking for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she waited as if not to hustle him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the question you understand was how i should save you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well im trying it by thus letting her know that i consider you worth saving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he couldnt tell her that however and she quickly pursued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his only answer at first was to help her to the dish that had been freshly put before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive written to her again since then ive left her in no doubt of what i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all it seems to me youve done for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah and you might have added all it seems to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughed again while she took up her knife and fork as in the cheer of these assurances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youre not sure how shell take it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh said strether with a slightly strained smile all that need concern you about her is that shes really a grand person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is that all that need concern me about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cant our friend returned have said any ill of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there were no such means of beguiling the time in this apartment which was as unpromising and tiresome as any waitingroom in one of our public establishments or any physicians diningroom during his hours of consultation at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were some fifteen or twenty persons in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one a tall wiry muscular old man from the west sunburnt and swarthy with a brown white hat on his knees and a giant umbrella resting between his legs who sat bolt upright in his chair frowning steadily at the carpet and twitching the hard lines about his mouth as if he had made up his mind to fix the president on what he had to say and wouldnt bate him a grain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another a kentucky farmer sixfeetsix in height with his hat on and his hands under his coattails who leaned against the wall and kicked the floor with his heel as though he had times head under his shoe and were literally killing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a third an ovalfaced bilious looking man with sleek black hair cropped close and whiskers and beard shaved down to blue dots who sucked the head of a thick stick and from time to time took it out of his mouth to see how it was getting on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and indeed all these gentlemen were so very persevering and energetic in this latter particular and bestowed their favours so abundantly upon the carpet that i take it for granted the presidential housemaids have high wages or to speak more genteelly an ample amount of compensation which is the american word for salary in the case of all public servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had not waited in this room many minutes before the black messenger returned and conducted us into another of smaller dimensions where at a businesslike table covered with papers sat the president himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked somewhat worn and anxious and well he might being at war with everybody but the expression of his face was mild and pleasant and his manner was remarkably unaffected gentlemanly and agreeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought that in his whole carriage and demeanour he became his station singularly well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being advised that the sensible etiquette of the republican court admitted of a traveller like myself declining without any impropriety an invitation to dinner which did not reach me until i had concluded my arrangements for leaving washington some days before that to which it referred i only returned to this house once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on the occasion of one of those general assemblies which are held on certain nights between the hours of nine and twelve oclock and are called rather oddly levees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went with my wife at about ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a pretty dense crowd of carriages and people in the courtyard and so far as i could make out there were no very clear regulations for the taking up or setting down of company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were certainly no policemen to soothe startled horses either by sawing at their bridles or flourishing truncheons in their eyes and i am ready to make oath that no inoffensive persons were knocked violently on the head or poked acutely in their backs or stomachs or brought to a standstill by any such gentle means and then taken into custody for not moving on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our carriage reached the porch in its turn without any blustering swearing shouting backing or other disturbance and we dismounted with as much ease and comfort as though we had been escorted by the whole metropolitan force from a to z inclusive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the suite of rooms on the groundfloor were lighted up and a military band was playing in the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the smaller drawing room the centre of a circle of company were the president and his daughterinlaw who acted as the lady of the mansion and a very interesting graceful and accomplished lady too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one gentleman who stood among this group appeared to take upon himself the functions of a master of the ceremonies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw no other officers or attendants and none were needed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great drawingroom which i have already mentioned and the other chambers on the groundfloor were crowded to excess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the company was not in our sense of the term select for it comprehended persons of very many grades and classes nor was there any great display of costly attire indeed some of the costumes may have been for aught i know grotesque enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the decorum and propriety of behaviour which prevailed were unbroken by any rude or disagreeable incident and every man even among the miscellaneous crowd in the hall who were admitted without any orders or tickets to look on appeared to feel that he was a part of the institution and was responsible for its preserving a becoming character and appearing to the best advantage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that these visitors too whatever their station were not without some refinement of taste and appreciation of intellectual gifts and gratitude to those men who by the peaceful exercise of great abilities shed new charms and associations upon the homes of their countrymen and elevate their character in other lands was most earnestly testified by their reception of washington irving my dear friend who had recently been appointed minister at the court of spain and who was among them that night in his new character for the first and last time before going abroad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sincerely believe that in all the madness of american politics few public men would have been so earnestly devotedly and affectionately caressed as this most charming writer and i have seldom respected a public assembly more than i did this eager throng when i saw them turning with one mind from noisy orators and officers of state and flocking with a generous and honest impulse round the man of quiet pursuits proud in his promotion as reflecting back upon their country and grateful to him with their whole hearts for the store of graceful fancies he had poured out among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long may he dispense such treasures with unsparing hand and long may they remember him as worthily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the term we had assigned for the duration of our stay in washington was now at an end and we were to begin to travel for the railroad distances we had traversed yet in journeying among these older towns are on that great continent looked upon as nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had at first intended going south to charleston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when i came to consider the length of time which this journey would occupy and the premature heat of the season which even at washington had been often very trying and weighed moreover in my own mind the pain of living in the constant contemplation of slavery against the more than doubtful chances of my ever seeing it in the time i had to spare stripped of the disguises in which it would certainly be dressed and so adding any item to the host of facts already heaped together on the subject i began to listen to old whisperings which had often been present to me at home in england when i little thought of ever being here and to dream again of cities growing up like palaces in fairy tales among the wilds and forests of the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the advice i received in most quarters when i began to yield to my desire of travelling towards that point of the compass was according to custom sufficiently cheerless my companion being threatened with more perils dangers and discomforts than i can remember or would catalogue if i could but of which it will be sufficient to remark that blowingsup in steamboats and breakings down in coaches were among the least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but having a western route sketched out for me by the best and kindest authority to which i could have resorted and putting no great faith in these discouragements i soon determined on my plan of action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was to travel south only to richmond in virginia and then to turn and shape our course for the far west whither i beseech the readers company in a new chapter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter ix a night steamer on the potomac river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harrisburg mail we were to proceed in the first instance by steamboat and as it is usual to sleep on board in consequence of the startinghour being four oclock in the morning we went down to where she lay at that very uncomfortable time for such expeditions when slippers are most valuable and a familiar bed in the perspective of an hour or two looks uncommonly pleasant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is ten oclock at night say halfpast ten moonlight warm and dull enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the steamer not unlike a childs noahs ark in form with the machinery on the top of the roof is riding lazily up and down and bumping clumsily against the wooden pier as the ripple of the river trifles with its unwieldy carcase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wharf is some distance from the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nobody down here and one or two dull lamps upon the steamers decks are the only signs of life remaining when our coach has driven away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as our footsteps are heard upon the planks a fat negress particularly favoured by nature in respect of bustle emerges from some dark stairs and marshals my wife towards the ladies cabin to which retreat she goes followed by a mighty bale of cloaks and great coats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i valiantly resolve not to go to bed at all but to walk up and down the pier till morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i begin my promenade thinking of all kinds of distant things and persons and of nothing near and pace up and down for halfan hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i go on board again and getting into the light of one of the lamps look at my watch and think it must have stopped and wonder what has become of the faithful secretary whom i brought along with me from boston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is supping with our late landlord a field marshal at least no doubt in honour of our departure and may be two hours longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walk again but it gets duller and duller the moon goes down next june seems farther off in the dark and the echoes of my footsteps make me nervous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has turned cold too and walking up and down without my companion in such lonely circumstances is but poor amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i break my staunch resolution and think it may be perhaps as well to go to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go on board again open the door of the gentlemens cabin and walk in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow or other from its being so quiet i suppose i have taken it into my head that there is nobody there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old farmer recollected days and nights of fierce warfare with the indians way back in the fifties when every ripple of the columbia river and her tributaries hid covert danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god had dowered him with a queer crooked gift of expression and a fierce anxiety for the welfare of his two little sonstanned and reserved children who attended school daily and spoke good english in a strange tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife was an austere woman who had once been kindly and perhaps handsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very many years of toil had taken the elasticity out of step and voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked for nothing better than everlasting workthe chafing detail of houseworkand then a grave somewhere up the hill among the blackberries and the pines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in her grim way she sympathized with her eldest daughter a small and silent maiden of eighteen who had thoughts very far from the meals she tended and the pans she scoured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stumbled into the household at a crisis and there was a deal of downright humanity in that same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a bad wicked dressmaker had promised the maiden a dress in time for a tomorrows railway journey and though the barefooted georgy who stood in very wholesome awe of his sister had scoured the woods on a pony in search that dress never arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so with sorrow in her heart and a hundred sisteranne glances up the road she waited upon the strangers and i doubt not cursed them for the wants that stood between her and her need for tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother in a heavy passionless voice rebuked her impatience yet sat up far into the night bowed over a heap of sewing for the daughters benefit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these things i beheld in the long marigoldscented twilight and whispering night loafing round the little house with california who unfolded himself like a lotus to the moon or in the little boarded bunk that was our bedroom swapping tales with portland and the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the yarns began in this wayred larry was a bullpuncher back of lone county montana or there was a man riding the trail met a jackrabbit sitting in a cactus or bout the time of the san diego land boom a woman from monterey etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can try to piece out for yourselves what sort of stories they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the way down the passage we marched with the prussian goosestep and felt the blood quickening to life in our legs and arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had proceeded in this manner for some ten minutes when we rounded a corner which i recognized at once by the peculiar circular formation of the walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were on our way to the great cavernthe cavern where we had first seen desiree and where later she had won the toss for our lives and then preserved them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another minute and we had reached the steps leading to the tunnel under the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here our guards seemed in doubt as to just what to do those in front halted and stood hesitant and it seemed to me that as they gazed below down the stone stair their eyes held a certain shrinking terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then one came up from behind and with a commanding gesture ordered them to descend and they obeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry and i still found ourselves surrounded by a full company there were fifty or sixty ahead of us and at least twice that number behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of a successful struggle was so patently impossible that i believe it never entered our minds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was further delay at the bottom of the stairs for as i have said before the tunnel was extremely narrow and it was barely possible to walk two abreast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of them turned back but harry and i could scarcely restrain a laugh at the sight of those immediately in front of us treading on the toes of their fellows to keep out of our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with all their savage brutality i believe they possessed little real bravery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five minutes more and we had reached the end of the tunnel and found ourselves at the foot of the spiral stairway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passage was so blocked by those ahead that we were unable to approach it they flattened their squatty bodies against the wall and we were forced to squeeze our way past them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there we stood barely able to make out their black forms against the blacker wall when the one who appeared to be the leader approached and motioned to us to ascend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hesitated feeling instinctively that this was our last chance to make a stand weighing our fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was a dark moment but though i did not know it providence was with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for happening to glance downward beneath the spiral stairfor there was no ground immediately beneath iti saw a faint glimmer and a movement as though of a dim light in the black yawning space at my feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must understand that we were now inside the base of the column in the center of the great moved either by curiosity or a command of providence i stooped and peered intently downward and saw that the movement was the almost imperceptible reflection of a stray ray of light from above on the surface of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the time i merely wondered idly if the water came from the same source as that in the lake outside not thinking it sufficiently important to mention to harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are a hundred to one and we are emptyhanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing else to do i answered and i placed my foot on the first step of the spiral stair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind us came the guide with a dozen others at his heels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ascent seemed even longer and more arduous than before for then we had been propelled by keen curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice i stumbled in the darkness and would have fallen if it had not been for harrys supporting hand behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but finally we reached the top and stepped out into the glare of the great cavern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw the stone slab close to behind us noiselessly and wondered if i should ever see it open again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we looked about us and as our eyes sought the alcove in the wall opposite we gave a simultaneous start of surprise and from harrys lips came a cry half of gladness half of wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for seated on the golden throne exactly as before was desiree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by her side was seated the inca king round them guards and attendants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we gazed at her in astonishment but she did not look at us even at that distance we could see that her eyes were lowered to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he called and i caught him by the arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cant possibly do us any good and you may do her harm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she doesnt answer it is because she has a reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was silent but not convinced and would probably have argued the matter if our attention had not been arrested by a movement in the alcove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king rose and extended an arm and the incas who filled the seats surrounding the cavern fell flat on their faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont seem to have thinned them out any i observed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe there are actually more than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by the way it is now apparent why they waited so long to attend to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king naturally wanted to be present at the entertainment and he had to take time to recover from his little fasting operation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now what in the name ofmy word the thing is to be done in all propriety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king had dropped his arm and the incas were again sitting as nature had intended they should sit instead of on their noses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and four attendants had approached the throne bearing a frame of quipos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we are to have a fair trial harry observed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right they cant get even with us anyway there are only two of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as far as the other is concerned i have an idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king had left his throne and approached the outer edge of the alcove until he stood almost directly under the oval plate of gold representing pachacamac or the unknown god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this he knelt and made a succession of weird uncouth gestures that suggested a lunatic or a traveling hypnotist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently the good pachacamac approved whatever suggestions the royal priest communicated for he rose to his feet with a solemn grin and strutted majestically to the rear facing the frame of quipos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was evident that he no longer had faith in desirees interpretation of the divine will of the great pachacamac <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a royal privilege to be able to judge your own enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hand of the child of the sun passed slowly up and down the frame of quipos betraying a commendable reluctance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it touched the yellow cord and passed on grasped the white and dropped it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does he imagine he is playing with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was an imperceptible movement rather felt than seen throughout the vast assemblage and desiree sank back on her throne of gold with a shudder as the king severed with the knife the black cord of death and laid it on the ground at her feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked at harry his face became slightly pale but his eyes met mine firmly speaking of a fortitude unconquerable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we again riveted our gaze on the alcove opposite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an attendant approached from the rear and stood before the golden throne while the king motioned to desiree to take up the black cord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment she did not understand him then she drew back shaking her head firmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king did not wait to argue the matter but stooped himself and picked up the cord and handed it to the attendant who received it with a great show of respect and retired to the rear where a commotion was created by its appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judgment was passed but what was to be the nature of the execution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that uncertainty and the weirdness of the scene gave to the thing an air of unreality that shut out the tragic and admitted only the grotesque <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have many times in my life felt nearer to death than when i stood on the top of that lofty column surrounded by the thousands of squatting dwarfs whose black bodies reflected dully the mounting light from the flaming urns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot say what we expected for we knew not what to expect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many conjectures entered my mind but none of them approached the fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but thinking that our guide might now return at any moment to lead us below and not caring to be surprised by an attack from behind on that narrow precipice i moved across to the rear where i could keep my eyes on the alcove opposite and at the same time watch the stone slab which closed the opening to the spiral stairway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a word to harry and he joined me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not likely i answered and anyway whats the use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knelt down and tugged at it but there was no edge on which to obtain a purchase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five minutes passed during which there was no movement either in the audience on the stone seats or in the alcove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was an indefinable air of expectancy on the faces of the king and those surrounding him and i kept a sharp eye on the stone slab <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry called across to desiree or rather began to call for i stopped him with a jerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was impossible for her to aid us and her situation was already sufficiently perilous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then becoming impatient i decided to try to move the stone slab myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kneeling down i placed the palms of my hands firmly against its surface and pressed with all my weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> complete comprehension flashed through my brain on the instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sprang to my feet and my thought must have shown on my face for harry looked at me in surprise what is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bend over and touch the palm of your hand to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phillips to let us sit together in school again and gertie pye can go with minnie andrews <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barry had the very best china set out marilla just as if i was real company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell you what a thrill it gave me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody ever used their very best china on my account before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves marilla <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barry asked me if i took tea and said pa why dont you pass the biscuits to anne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be lovely to be grown up marilla when just being treated as if you were is so nice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know about that said marilla with a brief sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well anyway when i am grown up said anne decidedly im always going to talk to little girls as if they were too and ill never laugh when they use big words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know from sorrowful experience how that hurts ones feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the taffy wasnt very good i suppose because neither diana nor i had ever made any before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> diana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and i forgot and let it burn and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the making of it was splendid fun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barry asked me to come over as often as i could and diana stood at the window and threw kisses to me all the way down to lovers lane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you marilla that i feel like praying tonight and im going to think out a special brandnew prayer in honor of the occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marilla can i go over to see diana just for a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked anne running breathlessly down from the east gable one february evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see what you want to be traipsing about after dark for said marilla shortly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and diana walked home from school together and then stood down there in the snow for half an hour more your tongues going the whole blessed time clicketyclack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i dont think youre very badly off to see her again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she wants to see me pleaded anne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has something very important to tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because she just signaled to me from her window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we set the candle on the window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill warrant you it was said marilla emphatically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the next thing youll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five mean come over as soon as possible because i have something important to reveal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> diana has just signaled five flashes and im really suffering to know what it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you neednt suffer any longer said marilla sarcastically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can go but youre to be back here in just ten minutes remember that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne did remember it and was back in the stipulated time although probably no mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the discussion of dianas important communication within the limits of ten minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at least she had made good use of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from school and stay all night with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and her cousins are coming over from newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the debating club concert at the hall tomorrow night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they are going to take diana and me to the concertif youll let me go that is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can calm down then because youre not going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre better at home in your own bed and as for that club concert its all nonsense and little girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure the debating club is a most respectable affair pleaded anne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youre not going to begin gadding about to concerts and staying out all hours of the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its such a very special occasion mourned anne on the verge of tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> diana has only one birthday in a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt as if birthdays were common things marilla <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prissy andrews is going to recite curfew must not ring tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is such a good moral piece marilla im sure it would do me lots of good to hear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and oh marilla the minister is going to take part yes indeed he is hes going to give an address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will be just about the same thing as a sermon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you heard what i said anne didnt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take off your boots now and go to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres just one more thing marilla said anne with the air of producing the last shot in her locker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barry told diana that we might sleep in the spareroom bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think of the honor of your little anne being put in the spareroom bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its an honor youll have to get along without <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go to bed anne and dont let me hear another word out of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when anne with tears rolling over her cheeks had gone sorrowfully upstairs matthew who had been apparently sound asleep on the lounge during the whole dialogue opened his eyes well now marilla i think you ought to let anne go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whos bringing this child up matthew you or me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it aint interfering to have your own opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and my opinion is that you ought to let anne go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd think i ought to let anne go to the moon if she took the notion ive no doubt was marillas amiable rejoinder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might have let her spend the night with diana if that was all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont approve of this concert plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shed go there and catch cold like as not and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understand that childs disposition and whats good for it better than you matthew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you ought to let anne go repeated matthew firmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> argument was not his strong point but holding fast to his opinion certainly was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marilla gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning when anne was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry matthew paused on his way out i think you ought to let anne go marilla <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment marilla looked things not lawful to be uttered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well she can go since nothing elsell please you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne flew out of the pantry dripping dishcloth in hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh marilla marilla say those blessed words again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess once is enough to say them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is matthews doings and i wash my hands of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or coming out of that hot hall in the middle of the night dont blame me blame matthew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne shirley youre dripping greasy water all over the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i know im a great trial to you marilla said anne repentantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then just think of all the mistakes i dont make although i might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill get some sand and scrub up the spots before i go to school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh marilla my heart was just set on going to that concert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never was to a concert in my life and when the other girls talk about them in school i feel so out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt know just how i felt about it but you see matthew did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matthew understands me and its so nice to be understood marilla <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gilbert blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out of sight in mental arithmetic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annes consequent humiliation was less than it might have been however in view of the concert and the spareroom bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and diana talked so constantly about it all day that with a stricter teacher than mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phillips dire disgrace must inevitably have been their portion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going to the concert for nothing else was discussed that day in school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the avonlea debating club which met fortnightly all winter had had several smaller free entertainments but this was to be a big affair admission ten cents in aid of the library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the avonlea young people had been practicing for weeks and all the scholars were especially interested in it by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody in school over nine years of age expected to go except carrie sloane whose father shared marillas opinions about small girls going out to night concerts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carrie sloane cried into her grammar all the afternoon and felt that life was not worth living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for anne the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and increased therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive ecstasy in the concert itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had a perfectly elegant tea and then came the delicious occupation of dressing in dianas little room upstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he died people wrote her letters of condolence if id written anything it would have been one of congratulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their father old abram booth was a disgusting old sot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was drunk at his wifes funeral and kept reeling round and hiccuping i didnt driiink much but i feel aa awfully queeer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave him a good jab in the back with my umbrella when he came near me and it sobered him up until they got the casket out of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young johnny booth was to have been married yesterday but he couldnt be because hes gone and got the mumps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could he help getting the mumps poor fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id poor fellow him believe me if i was kate sterns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how he could help getting the mumps but i do know the wedding supper was all prepared and everything will be spoiled before hes well again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he should have had the mumps when he was a boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come come cornelia dont you think youre a mite unreasonable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss cornelia disdained to reply and turned instead to susan baker a grimfaced kindhearted elderly spinster of the glen who had been installed as maidofallwork at the little house for some weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan had been up to the glen to make a sick call and had just returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid she will soon be in heaven poor thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh surely its not so bad as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed miss cornelia sympathetically captain jim and gilbert looked at each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are times said captain jim between spasms when it would be a sin not to laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in early june when the sand hills were a great glory of pink wild roses and the glen was smothered in apple blossoms marilla arrived at the little house accompanied by a black horsehair trunk patterned with brass nails which had reposed undisturbed in the green gables garret for half a century <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan baker who during her few weeks sojourn in the little house had come to worship young mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doctor as she called anne with blind fervor looked rather jealously askance at marilla at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as marilla did not try to interfere in kitchen matters and showed no desire to interrupt susans ministrations to young mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doctor the good handmaiden became reconciled to her presence and told her cronies at the glen that miss cuthbert was a fine old lady and knew her place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one evening when the skys limpid bowl was filled with a red glory and the robins were thrilling the golden twilight with jubilant hymns to the stars of evening there was a sudden commotion in the little house of dreams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> telephone messages were sent up to the glen doctor dave and a whitecapped nurse came hastily down marilla paced the garden walks between the quahog shells murmuring prayers between her set lips and susan sat in the kitchen with cotton wool in her ears and her apron over her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leslie looking out from the house up the brook saw that every window of the little house was alight and did not sleep that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the june night was short but it seemed an eternity to those who waited and watched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said marilla then she saw how grave the nurse and doctor dave looked and she dared ask no more questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not tell me said susan fiercely answering the anguish in marillas eyes that god could be so cruel as to take that darling lamb from us when we all love her so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has taken others as well beloved said marilla hoarsely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at dawn when the rising sun rent apart the mists hanging over the sandbar and made rainbows of them joy came to the little house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne was safe and a wee white lady with her mothers big eyes was lying beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gilbert his face gray and haggard from his nights agony came down to tell marilla and susan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan got up and took the cotton wool out of her ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am of the opinion that we will all be glad of a bite and sup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doctor not to worry about a single thingsusan is at the helm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you tell her just to think of her baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gilbert smiled rather sadly as he went away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne her pale face blanched with its baptism of pain her eyes aglow with the holy passion of motherhood did not need to be told to think of her baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a few hours she tasted of happiness so rare and exquisite that she wondered if the angels in heaven did not envy her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little joyce she murmured when marilla came in to see the baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we planned to call her that if she were a girlie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were so many we would have liked to name her for we couldnt choose between them so we decided on joycewe can call her joy for shortjoyit suits so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh marilla i thought i was happy before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i know that i just dreamed a pleasant dream of happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mustnt talk annewait till youre stronger said marilla warningly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know how hard it is for me not to talk smiled anne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first she was too weak and too happy to notice that gilbert and the nurse looked grave and marilla sorrowful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as subtly and coldly and remorselessly as a seafog stealing landward fear crept into her heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why would he not talk about the baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why would they not let her have it with her after that first heavenlyhappy hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gilbert whispered anne imploringly the babyis all rightisnt she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gilbert was a long while in turning round then he bent over anne and looked in her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marilla listening fearfully outside the door heard a pitiful heartbroken moan and fled to the kitchen where susan was weeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has been that built up and happy longing for that baby and planning for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew from the first the little thing couldnt live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it is such a sweet baby sobbed susan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw one so whitethey are mostly red or yallow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it opened its big eyes as if it was months old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sunset the little soul that had come with the dawning went away leaving heartbreak behind it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss cornelia took the wee white lady from the kindly but stranger hands of the nurse and dressed the tiny waxen form in the beautiful dress leslie had made for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she took it back and laid it beside the poor broken tearblinded little mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lord has given and the lord has taken away dearie she said through her own tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she went away leaving anne and gilbert alone together with their dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day the small white joy was laid in a velvet casket which leslie had lined with appleblossoms and taken to the graveyard of the church across the harbor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought of the marvellous beauty of skin and all the delightfulness of living texture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh the back of her arm she found the faintest down of hair in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she held out her arm straight before her and turned her hand this way and that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think of all the beauty in the world that is covered up and overlaid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she glanced shyly at the mirror above her dressingtable and then about her at the furniture as though it might penetrate to the thoughts that peeped in her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder said ann veronica at last if i am beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder if i shall ever shine like a light like a translucent i suppose girls and women have prayed for this have come to this in babylon in nineveh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why shouldnt one face the facts of ones self <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she posed herself before her mirror and surveyed herself with gravely thoughtful gravely critical and yet admiring eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after all i am just one common person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she watched the throb of the arteries in the stem of her neck and put her hand at last gently and almost timidly to where her heart beat beneath her breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the realization that she was in love flooded ann veronicas mind and altered the quality of all its topics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she began to think persistently of capes and it seemed to her now that for some weeks at least she must have been thinking persistently of him unawares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was surprised to find how stored her mind was with impressions and memories of him how vividly she remembered his gestures and little things that he had said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it occurred to her that it was absurd and wrong to be so continuously thinking of one engrossing topic and she made a strenuous effort to force her mind to other questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was extraordinary what seemingly irrelevant things could restore her to the thought of capes again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she went to sleep then always capes became the novel and wonderful guest of her dreams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time it really seemed allsufficient to her that she should love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that capes should love her seemed beyond the compass of her imagination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed she did not want to think of him as loving her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wanted to think of him as her beloved person to be near him and watch him to have him going about doing this and that saying this and that unconscious of her while she too remained unconscious of herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to think of him as loving her would make all that different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he would turn his face to her and she would have to think of herself in his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would become defensivewhat she did would be the thing that mattered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would require things of her and she would be passionately concerned to meet his requirements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loving was selfforgetfulness pure delighting in another human being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt that with capes near to her she would be content always to go on loving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went next day to the schools and her world seemed all made of happiness just worked up roughly into shapes and occasions and duties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she found she could do her microscope work all the better for being in love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she winced when first she heard the preparationroom door open and capes came down the laboratory but when at last he reached her she was selfpossessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put a stool for him at a little distance from her own and after he had seen the days work he hesitated and then plunged into a resumption of their discussion about beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think he said i was a little too mystical about beauty the other day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been thinking you know im not sure that primarily the perception of beauty isnt just intensity of feeling free from pain intensity of perception without any tissue destruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like the mystical way better said ann veronica and thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a number of beautiful things are not intense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but delicacy for example may be intensely perceived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but why is one face beautiful and another not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> objected ann veronica on your theory any two faces side by side in the sunlight ought to be equally beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one must get them with exactly the same intensity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are things faint and slight in themselves as physical facts but they are like the detonator of a bomb they let loose the explosive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres the internal factor as well as the external <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know if i express myself clearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean that the point is that vividness of perception is the essential factor of beauty but of course vividness may be created by a whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that brings us back said ann veronica to the mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should some things and not others open the deeps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well that might after all be an outcome of selection like the preference for blue flowers which are not nearly so bright as yellow of some insects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not quite so easily as it explains an insect alighting on colored paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but perhaps if people didnt like clear bright healthy eyeswhich is biologically understandablethey couldnt like precious stones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing may be a necessary collateral of the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after all a fine clear sky of bright colors is the signal to come out of hiding and rejoice and go on with life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> capes smiled cheerfully with his eyes meeting hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i throw it out in passing he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i am after is that beauty isnt a special inserted sort of thing thats my idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its just life pure life life nascent running clear and strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood up to go on to the next student <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said capes and paused and then bent down over the boy who wore his hair like russell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ann veronica surveyed his sloping back for a moment and then drew her microscope toward her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then for a time she sat very still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt that she had passed a difficult corner and that now she could go on talking with him again just as she had been used to do before she understood what was the matter with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had one idea she found very clear in her mindthat she would get a research scholarship and so contrive another year in the laboratory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i see what everything means said ann veronica to herself and it really felt for some days as though the secret of the universe that had been wrapped and hidden from her so obstinately was at last altogether displayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one afternoon soon after ann veronicas great discovery a bored and nothing to do will you dine with me tonight somewhere and talk i shall be grateful ramage ann veronica was rather pleased by this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not seen ramage for ten or eleven days and she was quite ready for a gossip with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now her mind was so full of the thought that she was in lovein love!that marvellous state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i really believe she had some dim idea of talking to him about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate it would be good to hear him saying the sort of things he didperhaps now she would grasp them betterwith this worldshaking secret brandishing itself about inside her head within a yard of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was sorry to find ramage a little disposed to be melancholy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have made over seven hundred pounds in the last week he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a bit of it he said its only a score in a game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a score you can buy all sorts of things with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned to the waiter who held a winecard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing can cheer me he said except champagne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything goes well with me he said folding his arms under him and regarding ann veronica with the slightly projecting eyes wide open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently he resumed i believe i must be in love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant be that said ann veronica wisely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it isnt exactly a depressing state is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great delusion of mankind is in supposing that to be individual and exceptional which is universal and according to law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a person is always startled when he hears himself seriously called an old man for the first time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nature gets us out of youth into manhood as sailors are hurried on board of vessels in a state of intoxication <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are hustled into maturity reeling with our passions and imaginations and we have drifted far away from port before we awake out of our illusions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to carry us out of maturity into old age without our knowing where we are going she drugs us with strong opiates and so we stagger along with wide open eyes that see nothing until snow enough has fallen on our heads to rouse our comatose brains out of their stupid trances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is one mark of age that strikes me more than any of the physical ones i mean the formation of habits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an old man who shrinks into himself falls into ways that become as positive and as much beyond the reach of outside influences as if they were governed by clockwork <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the animal functions as the physiologists call them in distinction from the organic tend in the process of deterioration to which age and neglect united gradually lead them to assume the periodical or rhythmical type of movement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every mans heart this organ belongs you know to the organic system has a regular mode of action but i know a great many men whose brains and all their voluntary existence flowing from their brains have a systole and diastole as regular as that of the heart itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> habit is the approximation of the animal system to the organic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a confession of failure in the highest function of being which involves a perpetual selfdetermination in full view of all existing circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but habit you see is an action in present circumstances from past motives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is substituting a vis a tergo for the evolution of living force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a man instead of burning up three hundred pounds of carbon a year has got down to two hundred and fifty it is plain enough he must economize force somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now habit is a laborsaving invention which enables a man to get along with less fuel that is all for fuel is force you know just as much in the page i am writing for you as in the locomotive or the legs that carry it to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carbon is the same thing whether you call it wood or coal or bread and cheese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a reverend gentleman demurred to this statement as if because combustion is asserted to be the sine qua non of thought therefore thought is alleged to be a purely chemical process <end> <end> 
<start> <start> facts of chemistry are one thing i told him and facts of consciousness another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it can be proved to him by a very simple analysis of some of his spare elements that every sunday when he does his duty faithfully he uses up more phosphorus out of his brain and nerves than on ordinary days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then he had his choice whether to do his duty or to neglect it and save his phosphorus and other combustibles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it follows from all this that the formation of habits ought naturally to be as it is the special characteristic of age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the muscular powers they pass their maximum long before the time when the true decline of life begins if we may judge by the experience of the ring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man is stale i think in their language soon after thirty often no doubt much earlier as gentlemen of the pugilistic profession are exceedingly apt to keep their vital fire burning with the blower up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the mean time i have been reading the treatise de senectute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not long but a leisurely performance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old gentleman was sixtythree years of age when he addressed it to his friend t <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a person of distinction some two or three years older <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we read it when we are schoolboys forget all about it for thirty years and then take it up again by a natural instinct provided always that we read latin as we drink water without stopping to taste it as all of us who ever learned it at school or college ought to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cato is the chief speaker in the dialogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a good deal of it is what would be called in vulgar phrase slow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it unpacks and unfolds incidental illustrations which a modern writer would look at the back of and toss each to its pigeonhole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think ancient classics and ancient people are alike in the tendency to this kind of expansion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an old doctor came to me once this is literal fact with some contrivance or other for people with broken kneepans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the patient would be confined for a good while he might find it dull work to sit with his hands in his lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reading the ingenious inventor suggested would be an agreeable mode of passing the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he mentioned in his written account of his contrivance various works that might amuse the weary hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember only three don quixote tom jones and watts on the mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not generally understood that ciceros essay was delivered as a lyceum lecture concio popularis at the temple of mercury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the journals papyri of the day tempora quotidiana tribuinus quirinalis praeco romanus and the rest gave abstracts of it one of which i have translated and modernized as being a substitute for the analysis i intended to make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lecture at the temple of mercury last evening was well attended by the elite of our great city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two hundred thousand sestertia were thought to have been represented in the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doors were besieged by a mob of shabby fellows illotum vulgus who were at length quieted after two or three had been somewhat roughly handled gladio jugulati <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the speaker was the wellknown mark tully eq <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has a lean and scraggy person with a very unpleasant excrescence upon his nasal feature from which his nickname of chickpea cicero is said by some to be derived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a lecturer is public property we may remark that his outer garment toga was of cheap stuff and somewhat worn and that his general style and appearance of dress and manner habitus vestitusque were somewhat provincial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lecture consisted of an imaginary dialogue between cato and laelius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found the first portion rather heavy and retired a few moments for refreshment pocula quaedam vini <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all want to reach old age says cato and grumble when they get it therefore they are donkeys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lecturer will allow us to say that he is the donkey we know we shall grumble at old age but we want to live through youth and manhood in spite of the troubles we shall groan over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was considerable prosing as to what old age can do and cant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly old folks cant jump break the necks of their thighbones femorum cervices if they do cant crack nuts with their teeth cant climb a greased pole malum inunctum scandere non possunt but they can tell old stories and give you good advice if they know what you have made up your mind to do when you ask them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this is well enough but wont set the tiber on fire tiberim accendere there were some clever things enough dicta hand inepta a few of which are worth reporting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old people are accused of being forgetful but they never forget where they have put their money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody is so old he doesnt think he can live a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lecturer quoted an ancient maxim grow old early if you would be old long but disputed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> authority he thought was the chief privilege of age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not great to have money but fine to govern those that have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old age begins at fortysix years according to the common opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not every kind of old age or of wine that grows sour with time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some excellent remarks were made on immortality but mainly borrowed from and credited to plato <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old milo champion of the heavy weights in his day looked at his arms and whimpered they are dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not so dead as you you old fool says cato you never were good for anything but for your shoulders and flanks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pisistratus asked solon what made him dare to be so obstinate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lecture was on the whole acceptable and a credit to our culture and civilization <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reporter goes on to state that there will be no lecture next week on account of the expected combat between the bear and the barbarian <end> <end>

<start> <start> after all the most encouraging things i find in the treatise de senectute are the stories of men who have found new occupations when growing old or kept up their common pursuits in the extreme period of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cato learned greek when he was old and speaks of wishing to learn the fiddle or some such instrument fidibus after the example of socrates <end> <end>

<start> <start> cyrus pointed out with pride and pleasure the trees he had planted with his own hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember a pillar on the duke of northumberlands estate at alnwick with an inscription in similar words if not the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that like other country pleasures never wears out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none is too rich none too poor none too young none too old to enjoy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a new england story i have heard more to the point however than any of ciceros <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a young farmer was urged to set out some appletrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said he they are too long growing and i dont want to plant for other people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young farmers father was spoken to about it but he with better reason alleged that appletrees were slow and life was fleeting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last some one mentioned it to the old grandfather of the young farmer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had nothing else to do so he stuck in some trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lived long enough to drink barrels of cider made from the apples that grew on those trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for myself after visiting a friend lately do remember all the time that this is the professors paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i remember well the day of our departure back to exile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elongated bizarre shabby travellingcarriage with four posthorses standing before the long front of the house with its eight columns four on each side of the broad flight of stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the steps groups of servants a few relations one or two friends from the nearest neighbourhood a perfect silence on all the faces an air of sober concentration my grandmother all in black gazing stoically my uncle giving his arm to my mother down to the carriage in which i had been placed already at the top of the flight my little cousin in a short skirt of a tartan pattern with a deal of red in it and like a small princess attended by the women of her own household the head gouvernante our dear corpulent francesca who had been for thirty years in the service of the b <end> <end> 
<start> <start> family the former nurse now outdoor attendant a handsome peasant face wearing a compassionate expression and the good ugly mlle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> durand the governess with her black eyebrows meeting over a short thick nose and a complexion like palebrown paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all the eyes turned toward the carriage her goodnatured eyes only were dropping tears and it was her sobbing voice alone that broke the silence with an appeal to me noublie pas ton francais mon cheri <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in three months simply by playing with us she had taught me not only to speak french but to read it as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the distance halfway down to the great gates a light open trap harnessed with three horses in russian fashion stood drawn up on one side with the police captain of the district sitting in it the vizor of his flat cap with a red band pulled down over his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems strange that he should have been there to watch our going so carefully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without wishing to treat with levity the just timidites of imperialists all the world over i may allow myself the reflection that a woman practically condemned by the doctors and a small boy not quite six years old could not be regarded as seriously dangerous even for the largest of conceivable empires saddled with the most sacred of responsibilities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this good man i believe did not think so either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i learned afterward why he was present on that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont remember any outward signs but it seems that about a month before my mother became so unwell that there was a doubt whether she could be made fit to travel in the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this uncertainty the governorgeneral in kiev was petitioned to grant her a fortnights extension of stay in her brothers house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no answer whatever was returned to this prayer but one day at dusk the police captain of the district drove up to the house and told my uncles valet who ran out to meet him that he wanted to speak with the master in private at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very much impressed he thought it was going to be an arrest the servant more dead than alive with fright as he related afterward smuggled him through the big drawingroom which was dark that room was not lighted every evening on tiptoe so as not to attract the attention of the ladies in the house and led him by way of the orangery to my uncles private apartments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the policeman without any preliminaries thrust a paper into my uncles hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no business to show this paper to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i cant either eat or sleep with such a job hanging over me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that police captain a native of great russia had been for many years serving in the district <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a service order issued from the governorgenerals secretariat dealing with the matter of the petition and directing the police captain to disregard all remonstrances and explanations in regard to that illness either from medical men or others and if she has not left her brothers houseit went on to sayon the morning of the day specified on her permit you are to despatch her at once under escort direct underlined to the prisonhospital in kiev where she will be treated as her case demands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see that your sister goes away punctually on that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont give me this work to do with a womanand with one of your family too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply cannot bear to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i certainly did not expect such a proposal as i am still so young and i confess that the idea of marrying is very distasteful to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> possibly i may not always be in this mind but i certainly feel that it will require some time to induce me to take the step which your majesty desires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this answer greatly distressed the king who was sincerely grieved by his objection to marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however he would not have recourse to extreme measures so he said i do not wish to force you i will give you time to reflect but remember that such a step is necessary for a prince such as you who will some day be called to rule over a great kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from this time prince camaralzaman was admitted to the royal council and the king showed him every mark of favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of a year the king took his son aside and said well my son have you changed your mind on the subject of marriage or do you still refuse to obey my wish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prince was less surprised but no less firm than on the former occasion and begged his father not to press the subject adding that it was quite useless to urge him any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this answer much distressed the king who again confided his trouble to his vizir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have followed your advice he said but camaralzaman declines to marry and is more obstinate than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sire replied the vizir much is gained by patience and your majesty might regret any violence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not wait another year and then inform the prince in the midst of the assembled council that the good of the state demands his marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cannot possibly refuse again before so distinguished an assemblage and in our immediate presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sultan ardently desired to see his son married at once but he yielded to the vizirs arguments and decided to wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then visited the princes mother and after telling her of his disappointment and of the further respite he had given his son he added i know that camaralzaman confides more in you than he does in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray speak very seriously to him on this subject and make him realize that he will most seriously displease me if he remains obstinate and that he will certainly regret the measures i shall be obliged to take to enforce my will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the first time the sultana fatima saw her son she told him she had heard of his refusal to marry adding how distressed she felt that he should have vexed his father so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked what reasons he could have for his objections to obey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madam replied the prince i make no doubt that there are as many good virtuous sweet and amiable women as there are others very much the reverse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what revolts me is the idea of marrying a woman without knowing anything at all about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father will ask the hand of the daughter of some neighbouring sovereign who will give his consent to our union <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be she fair or frightful clever or stupid good or bad i must marry her and am left no choice in the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how am i to know that she will not be proud passionate contemptuous and recklessly extravagant or that her disposition will in any way suit mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my son urged fatima you surely do not wish to be the last of a race which has reigned so long and so gloriously over this kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madam said the prince i have no wish to survive the king my father but should i do so i will try to reign in such a manner as may be considered worthy of my predecessors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these and similar conversations proved to the sultan how useless it was to argue with his son and the year elapsed without bringing any change in the princes ideas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length a day came when the sultan summoned him before the council and there informed him that not only his own wishes but the good of the empire demanded his marriage and desired him to give his answer before the assembled ministers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this camaralzaman grew so angry and spoke with so much heat that the king naturally irritated at being opposed by his son in full council ordered the prince to be arrested and locked up in an old tower where he had nothing but a very little furniture a few books and a single slave to wait on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> camaralzaman pleased to be free to enjoy his books showed himself very indifferent to his sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when night came he washed himself performed his devotions and having read some pages of the koran lay down on a couch without putting out the light near him and was soon asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there was a deep well in the tower in which prince camaralzaman was imprisoned and this well was a favourite resort of the fairy maimoune daughter of damriat chief of a legion of genii <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards midnight maimoune floated lightly up from the well intending according to her usual habit to roam about the upper world as curiosity or accident might prompt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light in the princes room surprised her and without disturbing the slave who slept across the threshold she entered the room and approaching the bed was still more astonished to find it occupied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prince lay with his face half hidden by the coverlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maimoune lifted it a little and beheld the most beautiful youth she had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a marvel of beauty he must be when his eyes are open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what can he have done to deserve to be treated like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could not weary gazing at camaralzaman but at length having softly kissed his brow and each cheek she replaced the coverlet and resumed her flight through the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she entered the middle region she heard the sound of great wings coming towards her and shortly met one of the race of bad genii <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this genie whose name was danhasch recognised maimoune with terror for he knew the supremacy which her goodness gave her over him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would gladly have avoided her altogether but they were so near that he must either be prepared to fight or yield to her so he at once good maimoune swear to me by allah to do me no harm and on my side i will promise not to injure you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied maimoune what harm can you do me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i will grant your power and give the promise you ask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now tell me what you have seen and done tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fair lady said danhasch you meet me at the right moment to hear something really interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must tell you that i come from the furthest end of china which is one of the largest and most powerful kingdoms in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the present king has one only daughter who is so perfectly lovely that neither you nor i nor any other creature could find adequate terms in which to describe her marvellous charms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must therefore picture to yourself the most perfect features joined to a brilliant and delicate complexion and an enchanting expression and even then imagination will fall short of the reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king her father has carefully shielded this treasure from the vulgar gaze and has taken every precaution to keep her from the sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be her husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in order to give her variety in her confinement he has built her seven palaces such as have never been seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first palace is entirely composed of rock crystal the second of bronze the third of fine steel the fourth of another and more precious species of bronze the fifth of touchstone the sixth of silver and the seventh of solid gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are all most sumptuously furnished whilst the gardens surrounding them are laid out with exquisite taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact neither trouble nor cost has been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide and many powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king has always received these embassies graciously but says that he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will and as she regularly declines each fresh proposal the envoys have had to leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as they were gratified by their magnificent receptions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sire said the princess to her father you wish me to marry and i know you desire to please me for which i am very grateful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but indeed i have no inclination to change my state for where could i find so happy a life amidst so many beautiful and delightful surroundings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel that i could never be as happy with any husband as i am here and i beg you not to press one on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last an embassy came from a king so rich and powerful that the king of china felt constrained to urge this suit on his daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told her how important such an alliance would be and pressed her to consent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact he pressed her so persistingly that the princess at length lost her temper and quite forgot the respect due to her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sire cried she angrily do not speak further of this or any other marriage or i will plunge this dagger in my breast and so escape from all these importunities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of china was extremely indignant with his daughter and replied you have lost your senses and you must be treated accordingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he had her shut in one set of rooms in one of her palaces and only allowed her ten old women of whom her nurse was the head to wait on her and keep her company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he next sent letters to all the kings who had sued for the princesss hand begging they would think of her no longer as she was quite insane and he desired his various envoys to make it known that anyone who could cure her should have her to wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fair maimoune continued danhasch this is the present state of affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never pass a day without going to gaze on this incomparable beauty and i am sure that if you would only accompany me you would think the sight well worth the trouble and own that you never saw such loveliness before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fairy only answered with a peal of laughter and when at length she had control of her voice she cried oh come you are making game of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you had something really interesting to tell me instead of raving about some unknown damsel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would you say if you could see the prince i have just been looking at and whose beauty is really transcendent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is something worth talking about you would certainly quite lose your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charming maimoune asked danhasch may i inquire who and what is the prince of whom you speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> know replied maimoune that he is in much the same case as your princess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king his father wanted to force him to marry and on the princes refusal to obey he has been imprisoned in an old tower where i have just seen him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont like to contradict a lady said danhasch but you must really permit me to doubt any mortal being as beautiful as my princess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> example a stick balanced vertically upon your finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neutral instability is a condition whereby an object disturbed has no tendency to move farther than displaced by the force of the disturbance and no tendency to return to its first position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in order that an aeroplane may be reasonably controllable it is necessary for it to possess some degree of stability longitudinally laterally and directionally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> longitudinal stability in an aeroplane is its stability about an axis transverse to the direction of normal horizontal flight and without which it would pitch and toss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lateral stability is its stability about its longitudinal axis and without which it would roll sideways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> directional stability is its stability about its vertical axis and without which it would have no tendency to keep its course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for such directional stability to exist there must be in effect more keelsurface behind the vertical axis than there is in front of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by keelsurface i mean every thing to be seen when looking at an aeroplane from the side of itthe sides of the body undercarriage struts wires etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know what would happen if there was insufficient keelsurface behind the vertical axis upon which it is pivoted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would turn off its proper course which is opposite to the direction of the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very much the same in the case of an aeroplane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in effect because although there may be actually the greatest proportion of keelsurface in front of the vertical axis such surface may be much nearer to the axis than is the keelsurface towards the tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter may then be actually less than the surface in front but being farther from the axis it has a greater leverage and consequently is greater in effect than the surface in front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the above illustration represents an aeroplane directionally stable flying along the course b <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gust striking it as indicated acts upon the greater proportion of keelsurface behind the turning axis and throws it into the new course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it does not however travel along the new course owing to its momentum in the direction b <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it travels as long as such momentum lasts in a direction which is the resultant of the two forces thrust and momentum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the centre line of the aeroplane is pointing in the direction of the new course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore its attitude relative to the direction of motion is more or less sideways and it consequently receives an air pressure in the direction c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such pressure acting upon the keelsurface presses the tail back towards its first position in which the aeroplane is upon its course b <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i have described is continually going on during flight but in a welldesigned aeroplane such stabilizing movements are most of the time so slight as to be imperceptible to the pilot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if an aeroplane was not stabilized in this way it would not only be continually trying to leave its course but it would also possess a dangerous tendency to nose away from the direction of the side gusts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in such case the gust shown in the above illustration would turn the aeroplane round the opposite way a very considerable distance and the right wing being on the outside of the turn would travel with greater velocity than the left wing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> increased velocity means increased lift and so the right wing lifting the aeroplane would turn over sideways very quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> longitudinal stability.flat surfaces are longitudinally stable owing to the fact that with decreasing angles of incidence the centre line of pressure cp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is a line taken across the surface transverse to the direction of motion and about which all the air forces may be said to balance or through which they may be said to act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imagine a to be a flat surface attitude vertical travelling through the air in the direction of motion m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is then obviously along the exact centre line of the surface as illustrated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in b c and d the surfaces are shown with angles of incidence decreasing to nothing and you will note that the cp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now should some gust or eddy tend to make the surface decrease the angle ie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moves forward and pushes the front of the surface up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should the surface tend to assume too large an angle then the reverse happensthe cp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moves back and pushes the rear of the surface up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not however used on account of their poor liftdrift ratio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss tita protested in a confusion of exclamations and murmurs but i lost no time in saying that if she would do me the honor to accept the hospitality of my boat i would engage that she should not be bored <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or if she did not want so much of my company the boat itself with the gondolier was at her service he was a capital oar and she might have every confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss tita without definitely answering this speech looked away from me out of the window as if she were going to cry and i remarked that once we had miss bordereaus approval we could easily come to an understanding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we would take an hour whichever she liked one of the very next days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i made my obeisance to the old lady i asked her if she would kindly permit me to see her again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment she said nothing then she inquired is it very necessary to your happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it diverts me more than i can say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can i believe that when i see you more animated more brilliant than when i came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is very true aunt said miss tita <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isnt it touching the solicitude we each have that the other shall enjoy herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you think me brilliant today you dont know what you are talking about you have never seen an agreeable woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont try to pay me a compliment i have been spoiled she went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my door is shut but you may sometimes knock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this she dismissed me and i left the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latch closed behind me but miss tita contrary to my hope had remained within <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i passed slowly across the hall and before taking my way downstairs i waited a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my hope was answered after a minute miss tita followed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a delightful idea about the piazza i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been disconcerted as i have mentioned but i had already perceived and i was to observe again that when miss tita was embarrassed she did not as most women would have done turn away from you and try to escape but came closer as it were with a deprecating clinging appeal to be spared to be protected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her attitude was perpetually a sort of prayer for assistance for explanation and yet no woman in the world could have been less of a comedian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the moment you were kind to her she depended on you absolutely her selfconsciousness dropped from her and she took the greatest intimacy the innocent intimacy which was the only thing she could conceive for granted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me she did not know what had got into her aunt she had changed so quickly she had got some idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i replied that she must find out what the idea was and then let me know we would go and have an ice together at florians and she should tell me while we listened to the band <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh it will take me a long time to find out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said rather ruefully and she could promise me this satisfaction neither for that night nor for the next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was patient now however for i felt that i had only to wait and in fact at the end of the week one lovely evening after dinner she stepped into my gondola to which in honor of the occasion i had attached a second oar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we swept in the course of five minutes into the grand canal whereupon she uttered a murmur of ecstasy as fresh as if she had been a tourist just arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had forgotten how splendid the great waterway looked on a clear hot summer evening and how the sense of floating between marble palaces and reflected lights disposed the mind to sympathetic talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we floated long and far and though miss tita gave no highpitched voice to her satisfaction i felt that she surrendered herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was more than pleased she was transported the whole thing was an immense liberation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queen fixed her gaze upon a plump young maiden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her victim tried to turn away hiding her face in her hands and kneeling behind a woman but the reptile with unblinking eyes stared on with such fixity that i could have sworn her vision penetrated the woman and the girls arms to reach at last the very center of her brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly the reptiles head commenced to move to and fro but the eyes never ceased to bore toward the frightened girl and then the victim responded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned wide fearhaunted eyes toward the mahar queen slowly she rose to her feet and then as though dragged by some unseen power she moved as one in a trance straight toward the reptile her glassy eyes fixed upon those of her captor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the waters edge she came nor did she even pause but stepped into the shallows beside the little island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on she moved toward the mahar who now slowly retreated as though leading her victim on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water rose to the girls knees and still she advanced chained by that clammy eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the water was at her waist now her armpits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her fellows upon the island looked on in horror helpless to avert her doom in which they saw a forecast of their own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mahar sank now till only the long upper bill and eyes were exposed above the surface of the water and the girl had advanced until the end of that repulsive beak was but an inch or two from her face her horrorfilled eyes riveted upon those of the reptile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the water passed above the girls mouth and noseher eyes and forehead all that showedyet still she walked on after the retreating mahar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queens head slowly disappeared beneath the surface and after it went the eyes of her victimonly a slow ripple widened toward the shores to mark where the two vanished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time all was silence within the temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mahars watched the surface of the water for the reappearance of their queen and presently at one end of the tank her head rose slowly into view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was backing toward the surface her eyes fixed before her as they had been when she dragged the helpless girl to her doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then to my utter amazement i saw the forehead and eyes of the maiden come slowly out of the depths following the gaze of the reptile just as when she had disappeared beneath the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on and on came the girl until she stood in water that reached barely to her knees and though she had been beneath the surface sufficient time to have drowned her thrice over there was no indication other than her dripping hair and glistening body that she had been submerged at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again and again the queen led the girl into the depths and out again until the uncanny weirdness of the thing got on my nerves so that i could have leaped into the tank to the childs rescue had i not taken a firm hold of myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once they were below much longer than usual and when they came to the surface i was horrified to see that one of the girls arms was gonegnawed completely off at the shoulderbut the poor thing gave no indication of realizing pain only the horror in her set eyes seemed intensified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next time they appeared the other arm was gone and then the breasts and then a part of the faceit was awful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor creatures on the islands awaiting their fate tried to cover their eyes with their hands to hide the fearful sight but now i saw that they too were under the hypnotic spell of the reptiles so that they could only crouch in terror with their eyes fixed upon the terrible thing that was transpiring before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally the queen was under much longer than ever before and when she rose she came alone and swam sleepily toward her bowlder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment she mounted it seemed to be the signal for the other mahars to enter the tank and then commenced upon a larger scale a repetition of the uncanny performance through which the queen had led her victim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the women and children fell prey to the maharsthey being the weakest and most tenderand when they had satisfied their appetite for human flesh some of them devouring two and three of the slaves there were only a score of fullgrown men left and i thought that for some reason these were to be spared but such was far from the case for as the last mahar crawled to her rock the queens thipdars darted into the air circled the temple once and then hissing like steam engines swooped down upon the remaining slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no hypnotism herejust the plain brutal ferocity of the beast of prey tearing rending and gulping its meat but at that it was less horrible than the uncanny method of the mahars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time the thipdars had disposed of the last of the slaves the mahars were all asleep upon their rocks and a moment later the great pterodactyls swung back to their posts beside the queen and themselves dropped into slumber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought the mahars seldom if ever slept i said to ja <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davyboy dont leave those peapods on the back stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were possibly a few track men out there who knew the race horse as well as edna but there was certainly none who knew it better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat between her two companions as one having authority to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughed at arobins pretensions and deplored mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the race horse was a friend and intimate associate of her childhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the atmosphere of the stables and the breath of the blue grass paddock revived in her memory and lingered in her nostrils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not perceive that she was talking like her father as the sleek geldings ambled in review before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she played for very high stakes and fortune favored her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fever of the game flamed in her cheeks and eves and it got into her blood and into her brain like an intoxicant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people turned their heads to look at her and more than one lent an attentive car to her utterances hoping thereby to secure the elusive but everdesired tip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arobin caught the contagion of excitement which drew him to edna like a magnet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> highcamp remained as usual unmoved with her indifferent stare and uplifted eyebrows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arobin also remained and sent away his drag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dinner was quiet and uninteresting save for the cheerful efforts of arobin to enliven things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> highcamp deplored the absence of her daughter from the races and tried to convey to her what she had missed by going to the dante reading instead of joining them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl held a geranium leaf up to her nose and said nothing but looked knowing and noncommittal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> highcamp was a plain baldheaded man who only talked under compulsion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> highcamp was full of delicate courtesy and consideration toward her husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she addressed most of her conversation to him at table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sat in the library after dinner and read the evening papers together under the droplight while the younger people went into the drawingroom near by and talked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss highcamp played some selections from grieg upon the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to have apprehended all of the composers coldness and none of his poetry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while edna listened she could not help wondering if she had lost her taste for music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the time came for her to go home mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> highcamp grunted a lame offer to escort her looking down at his slippered feet with tactless concern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the car ride was long and it was late when they reached esplanade street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arobin asked permission to enter for a second to light his cigarettehis match safe was empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he filled his match safe but did not light his cigarette until he left her after she had expressed her willingness to go to the races with him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was hungry again for the highcamp dinner though of excellent quality had lacked abundance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of gruyere and some crackers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she vacantly hummed a fantastic tune as she poked at the wood embers on the hearth and munched a cracker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wanted something to happensomething anything she did not know what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she regretted that she had not made arobin stay a half hour to talk over the horses with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was nothing else to do so she went to bed and tossed there for hours in a sort of monotonous agitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle of the night she remembered that she had forgotten to write her regular letter to her husband and she decided to do so next day and tell him about her afternoon at the jockey club <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lay wide awake composing a letter which was nothing like the one which she wrote next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the maid awoke her in the morning edna was dreaming of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> highcamp playing the piano at the entrance of a music store on canal street while his wife was saying to alcee arobin as they boarded an what a pity that so much talent has been neglected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a few days later alcee arobin again called for edna in his drag mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as that lady had not been apprised of his intention of picking her up she was not at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the daughter was just leaving the house to attend the meeting of a branch folk lore society and regretted that she could not accompany them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arobin appeared nonplused and asked edna if there were any one else she cared to ask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not deem it worth while to go in search of any of the fashionable acquaintances from whom she had withdrawn herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought of madame ratignolle but knew that her fair friend did not leave the house except to take a languid walk around the block with her husband after nightfall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle reisz would have laughed at such a request from edna <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame lebrun might have enjoyed the outing but for some reason edna did not want her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the excitement came back upon her like a remittent fever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was no labor to become intimate with arobin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the preliminary stage of becoming acquainted was one which he always endeavored to ignore when a pretty and engaging woman was concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stayed and sat beside the wood fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they laughed and talked and before it was time to go he was telling her how different life might have been if he had known her years before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with ingenuous frankness he spoke of what a wicked illdisciplined boy he had been and impulsively drew up his cuff to exhibit upon his wrist the scar from a saber cut which he had received in a duel outside of paris when he was nineteen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she touched his hand as she scanned the red cicatrice on the inside of his white wrist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a quick impulse that was somewhat spasmodic impelled her fingers to close in a sort of clutch upon his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt the pressure of her pointed nails in the flesh of his palm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she arose hastily and walked toward the mantel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight of a wound or scar always agitates and sickens me she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg your pardon he entreated following her it never occurred to me that it might be repulsive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood close to her and the effrontery in his eyes repelled the old vanishing self in her yet drew all her awakening sensuousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw enough in her face to impel him to take her hand and hold it while he said his lingering good night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to lose all the money ive won and ive got to work when the weather is bright instead of yes work to be sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what morning may i come up to your atelier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might help you with a stray suggestion or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont you go after you have said good night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember that i did it under protest it was a very fine wine and expensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pierce very quietly that because you were with awell because you were with a woman i could not return your compliment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i demanded the privilege at some future date when you were alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> von inwald that now when i am alone there is no wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pierce agreed slowly but there is i opened the door at that and both of them started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> von inwald was standing with his arms folded and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pierce had one arm raised holding up a glass of spring water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in another second it would have been in the other mans face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pierce and took the glass out of his hand and his expression was funny to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been looking everywhere for that glass i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> von inwald laughed and picked up his soft hat from the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned around at the door and looked back at mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was such a fine wine and so expensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was pretty nervous when i took charge of the news stand that evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amanda king had an appointment with the dentist and had left everything topsyturvey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was still straightening up when people began to come down to dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss cobb walked over to the news stand and shed cut the white yoke out of her purple silk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody has dressed for dinner tonight minnie she informed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> von inwald to have a wrong idea of american society especially after mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carters ridiculous conduct this afternoon and i wonder if youll be sweet enough to start the phonograph in the orchestra gallery as we go in something with dignity you knowthe wedding march or the overture from aida <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aidas cracked i said shortly and as far as im concerned mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> von inwald can walk in to his meals without music or starve to death waiting for the band <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she got the phonograph anyhow and put the elevator boy in the gallery with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she picked out some things by caruso and tetrazzini and piled them on a chair but james had things to himself up there and played the spring chicken through three times during dinner with miss cobb glaring at the gallery until the back of her neck ached and the diningroom girls waltzing in with the dishes and polkaing out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moody came out when dinner was over in a fearful rage and made for the news stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of your ideas i suppose he asserted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what sort of a night am i going to have after chewing my food to ragtime with my jaws doing a skirtdance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why in heavens name couldnt you have had something slow like handels largo if youve got to have music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dinner was over fifteen minutes sooner than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> james cakewalked everybody out to my ann elizer and miss cobb was mortified to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for one i got a good look at miss julia summers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was lighthaired and well fleshed with an ugly face but a pleasant smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore a low necked dress that made miss cobbs with the yoke out look like a storm collar and if she had a broken heart she didnt show it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hello she cried looking at my hair are you selling tobacco here or are you the cigarlighter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am employed as the extinguisher of gay guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i watch that line of knitting women ill be crotcheting arabellas wool in my sleep tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well she was too cheerful to be angry with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she stayed around for a while and it was amazing how much tobacco i sold that evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men who usually bought tobies bought the best cigars and when mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings came up scowling and i handed him the brand hed smoked for years she took one clipped the end of it as neat as a finger nail and gave it to him holding up the lighter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not going to smoke yet young woman he said glaring at im sorry she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been waiting hungrily until some discriminating smoker would buy one of those and light it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he stood there for thirty minutes standing mostly on one foot on account of the gouty one puffing like a locomotive with her sniffing at the aroma and telling him how lonely she felt with no friends around and just recovering from a severe illness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hutchins bring him his furlined coat and he and miss julia took arabella the dog for a walk on the veranda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the evening was quiet and i needed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> von inwald talked by the fire and i think he told her somethingnot allof the scene in the springhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pierce at the foot of the stairs on her way up for the night and she pretended not to see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood there looking up after her with his mouth set and at the turn she glanced down and caught his eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought she flushed but i wasnt sure and at that minute senator biggs bought three twentyfivecent cigars and told me to keep the change from a dollar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was so surprised at the alteration in him that i forgot miss patty entirely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about twelve oclock just after i went to my room somebody knocked at the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i opened the new doctor was standing in the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sorry to disturb you he said but nobody seems to know where the pharmacy clerk is and ill have to get some medicine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if id had my way wed have had a bell on that pharmacy clerk long ago i snapped getting my keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> biggs is his name i think a senator or something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was leading the way to the stairs but i stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got as pretty a case of indigestion as ive seen for some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he insisted it was indigestion although i argued that it wasnt possible and he wanted ipecac <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men got batted over the head often enough in those days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for some reason i picked him up and carried him to my dobe shack and laid him out and washed his cut with sour wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sour wine is fine to put a wound in shape to heal but its no soothing syrup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat up as though hed been touched with a hot poker stared around wildeyed and cut loose with that song you were singing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their coffin was their ship and their grave it was the sea blow high blow low what care we and the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea down on the coast of the high barbaree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it fair made my hair rise to hear him with the big still solemn desert outside and the quiet moonlight and the shadows and him sitting up straight and gaunt his eyes blazing each side his big eagle nose and his snaky hair hanging over the raw cut across his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however i made out to get him bandaged up and in shape and pretty soon he sort of went to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he was clean out of his head for nigh two weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the time he lay flat on his back staring at the pole roof his eyes burning and looking like they saw each one something a different distance off the way crazy eyes do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then again hed sing that barbaree song until id go out and look at the old colorado flowing by just to be sure i hadnt died and gone below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like listening to one end of a telephone though we didnt know what telephones were in those days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began when be was a kid and he gave his side of conversations pausing for replies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could mighty near furnish the replies sometimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was queer lingoabout ships and ships officers and gales and calms and fights and pearls and whales and islands and birds and skies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to listen by the hour but i never made out anything really important as to who the man was or where hed come from or what hed done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of the second week i came in at noon as per usual to fix him up with grub <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt pay any attention to him for he was quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i was bending over the fire he spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> usually i didnt bother with his talk for it didnt mean anything but something in his voice made me turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was lying on his side those black eyes of his blazing at me but now both of them saw the same distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you aint in any shape to want clothes said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hadnt any more than got the words out of my mouth before he was atop me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had me by the throat with his hand and i felt the point of the hook pricking the back of my neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but hed been too sick and too long abed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned dizzy and keeled over and i dumped him back on the bunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a minute or so he came to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now youre a nice sweet proposition said i as soon as i was sure he could understand me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here i pick you up on the street and save your worthless carcass and the first chance you get you try to crawl my hump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for heavens sake i yelled at him whats the matter with you and your old clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there aint enough of them to dust a fiddle with anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think id want with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now look here said i you cant get up today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know he pleaded but let me see them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just to satisfy him i passed over his old duds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i what did you expect would happen to you lying around yuma after midnight with a hole in your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had no coat when i picked you up i replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at me mighty suspicious but didnt say anything more he wouldnt even answer when i spoke to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after hed eaten a fair meal he fell asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i came back that evening the bunk was empty and he was gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt see him again for two days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i caught sight of him quite a ways off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he nodded at me very sour and dodged around the corner of the store <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guess he suspicions i stole that old coat of his thinks i and afterwards i found that my surmise had been correct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however he didnt stay long in that frame of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was along towards evening and i was walking on the banks looking down over the muddy old colorado as i always liked to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun had just set and the mountains had turned hard and stiff as they do after the glow and the sky above them was a thousand million miles deep of pale greengold light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pair of greasers were ahead of me but i could see only their outlines and they didnt seem to interfere any with the scenery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly a black figure seemed to rise up out of the ground the mexican man went down as though hed been jerked with a string and the woman screeched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mex was flat on his face his arms stretched out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the middle of his back knelt my onearmed friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that sharp hook was caught neatly under the point of the mexicans jaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i really think i was just in time to save the mans life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to my belief another minute would have buried the hook in the mexicans neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyway i thrust the muzzle of my colts into the sailors face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sailor looked up at me without changing his position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ween heem at monte off antonio curvez said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still held the hook under the mans jaw but with the other hand he ran rapidly under and over the mexicans left shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the half light i could see his face change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gleam died from his eye the snarl left his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without further delay he arose to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mexican was only too glad to get off so easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know whether hed really won the coat at monte or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and anyhow maybe if you met this fellow and talked to him you would find him a disapointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many a pretty girl i have seen in my time who didnt pan out acording to specifications when i finaly met her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this revalation of my beloved fathers true self i was almost stuned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is evadent that i do not inherit my being true as steal from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor from my mother who is like steal in hardness but not in being true to anything but social position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i record this awfull day dear dairy there comes again into my mind the thought that i do not belong here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not even resemble them in features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i belonged to them would they not treat me with more consideration and less disipline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is all well enough for hannah to observe that i was a pretty baby with fat cheaks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may not hannah herself for some hiden reason have brought me here taking away the real i to perhaps languish unseen and waste my sweetness on the dessert air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> life must be made the best of as it is and not as it might be or indeed ought to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father promised before he left that i was not to be scolded as i felt far from well and was drinking water about every minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i just want to lie here and think about things i said when he was going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i need any help to carry out a plan i have will you give it to me or will i have to go to totle strangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked out into the hall to see if mother was near <end> <end> 
<start> <start> familey mother and sis very dignafied and nothing much to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father rushed and not coming home to dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later jane raleigh is home for her couzins wedding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall take a walk as i have much to tell her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been in his dressing room conversing as though acustomed to such things all my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have conceled under the mattress a real photograph of him beneath which he has written yours always adrian egleston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am writing in bed as the room is chilleyor i amand by putting out my hand i can touch his pictured likeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane came around for me this afternoon and mother consented to a walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not have a chance to take siss pink hat as she keeps her door locked now when not in her room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which is rediculous because i am not her tipe and her things do not suit me very well anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i have never borowed anything but gloves and handkercheifs except maidies dress and the hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had however not locked her bathroom and finding a bunch of violets in the washbowl i put them on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it does not hurt violets to wear them and anyhow i knew carter brooks had sent them and she ought to wear only beresfords flowers if she means to marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane at once remarked that i looked changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i didnt know you bab she observed i would say that you are rouged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i became very stiff and distant at that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for jane although my best friend had no right to be suspicous of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youbab i beleive you are up to some mischeif <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont need to pretend to me she went on looking into my very soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre not decked out this way for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had meant to tell her nothing but spying just then a man ahead who walked like adrian i was startled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cluched her arm and closed my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man turned and i saw it was not he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but jane was watching me and i spoke out of an overflowing heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment i thoughtjane i have met the one at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i told her in broken accents of my determination to stick to him no matter what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so finding her fuller of simpathy than usual i violated my vow of silence and told her all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to prove the truth of what i said i showed her the sachet over my heart containing his rose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its perfectly wonderfull jane said in an awed tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you beat anything ive ever known for adventures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are the tipe men like for one thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there is one thing i could not stand in your placehaving to know that he is making love to the heroine every evening and twice on wednesdays andbab this is wednesday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly dear dairy i became conscious of a dual going on within me between love and duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should i do as instructed and see him no more thus crushing my inclination under the iron heal of resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or should i cast my parents to the winds and go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last i desided to leave it to jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i observed im forbiden to try to see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i darsay if you bought some theater tickets and did not say what the play was and we went and it happened to be his it would not be my fault would it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot recall her reply or much more except that i waited in a pharmasy and jane went out and came back and took me by the arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to the matinee bab she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill not tell you which one because its to be a surprize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall draw a veil over my feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane bought some chocolates to take along but i could eat none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we went in and the curtain went up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when adrian saw me in the front row he smiled although in the midst of a serious speach about the world oweing him a living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and oh bab i can see that he adores you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the rest of the people mean nothing to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i had not told her that we had not yet met and she said i could do nothing less than send him a note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ought to tell him that you are true in spite of everything she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had not decieved jane things would be better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she was set on my sending the note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so at last i wrote one on my visiting card holding it so she could not read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane is my best friend and i am devoted to her but she has no scruples about reading what is dear mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> egleston i think the play is perfectly wonderfull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is perfectly terrable that it is going to stop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i did not feel bold dear dairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was such a letter as any one might read and contained nothing compromizing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still i darsay i should not have written it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next moment the frail little body had whirled through the air and shattered against the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother ran to it caught it up in her arms and crouched over it crying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> redeye started over to pick up the stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> redeyes great hand shot out and clutched the old man by the back of the neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his body went limp as he surrendered himself to his fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> redeye hesitated a moment and marrowbone shivering terribly bowed his head and covered his face with his crossed arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then redeye slammed him facedownward to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lay there crying with the fear of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw the hairless one out in the open space beating his chest and bristling but afraid to come forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then in obedience to some whim of his erratic spirit redeye let the old man alone and passed on and recovered the stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he returned to the wall and began to climb up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lopear who was shivering and peeping alongside of me scrambled back into the cave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was plain that redeye was bent upon murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was desperate and angry and fairly cool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> running back and forth along the neighboring ledges i gathered a heap of rocks at the caveentrance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> redeye was now several yards beneath me concealed for the moment by an outjut of the cliff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he climbed his head came into view and i banged a rock down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it missed striking the wall and shattering but the flying dust and grit filled his eyes and he drew back out of view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a chuckling and chattering arose from the horde that played the part of audience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last there was one of the folk who dared to face redeye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as their approval and acclamation arose on the air redeye snarled down at them and on the instant they were subdued to silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> encouraged by this evidence of his power he thrust his head into view and by scowling and snarling and gnashing his fangs tried to intimidate me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he scowled horribly contracting the scalp strongly over the brows and bringing the hair down from the top of the head until each hair stood apart and pointed straight forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight chilled me but i mastered my fear and with a stone poised in my hand threatened him back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i drove the stone down at him and made a sheer miss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slipped back out of sight but as he disappeared i could see him clutching for a grip on the wall with one hand and with the other clutching at his throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not see him any more though i could hear him choking and strangling and coughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i crouched on the lip of the entrance and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strangling and coughing died down and i could hear him now and again clearing his throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little later he began to climb down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went very quietly pausing every moment or so to stretch his neck or to feel it with his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sight of him descending the whole horde with wild screams and yells stampeded for the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he reached the ground he skirted the base of the bluff and climbed up and into his own cave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stared at lopear and he stared back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately and with great caution and quietness we began climbing up the cliff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we reached the top we looked back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abidingplace was deserted redeye remained in his cave and the horde had disappeared in the depths of the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dashed across the open spaces and down the slopes unmindful of possible snakes in the grass until we reached the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up into the trees we went and on and on swinging our arboreal flight until we had put miles between us and the caves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in their presence he could not persist in flying high with the wings of war they rendered it almost impossible for him to see himself in a heroic light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he discovered that he had a scorching thirst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was so dry and grimy that he thought he could feel his skin crackle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each bone of his body had an ache in it and seemingly threatened to break with each movement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was more powerful than a direct hunger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a dull weightlike feeling in his stomach and when he tried to walk his head swayed and he tottered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> small patches of green mist floated before his vision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he had been tossed by many emotions he had not been aware of ailments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he was at last compelled to pay attention to them his capacity for selfhate was multiplied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in despair he declared that he was not like those others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he now conceded it to be impossible that he should ever become a hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he groaned from his heart and went staggering off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain mothlike quality within him kept him in the vicinity of the battle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a great desire to see and to get news <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told himself that despite his unprecedented suffering he had never lost his greed for a victory yet he said in a halfapologetic manner to his conscience he could not but know that a defeat for the army this time might mean many favorable things for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blows of the enemy would splinter regiments into fragments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus many men of courage he considered would be obliged to desert the colors and scurry like chickens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would be sullen brothers in distress and he could then easily believe he had not run any farther or faster than they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if he himself could believe in his virtuous perfection he conceived that there would be small trouble in convincing all others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said as if in excuse for this hope that previously the army had encountered great defeats and in a few months had shaken off all blood and tradition of them emerging as bright and valiant as a new one thrusting out of sight the memory of disaster and appearing with the valor and confidence of unconquered legions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shrilling voices of the people at home would pipe dismally for a time but various general were usually compelled to listen to these ditties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he of course felt no compunctions for proposing a general as a sacrifice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not tell who the chosen for the barbs might be so he could center no direct sympathy upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people were afar and he did not conceive public opinion to be accurate at long range <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite probable they would hit the wrong man who after he had recovered from his amazement would perhaps spend the rest of his days in writing replies to the songs of his alleged failure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be very unfortunate no doubt but in this case a general was of no consequence to the youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a defeat there would be a roundabout vindication of himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought it would prove in a manner that he had fled early because of his superior powers of perception <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a serious prophet upon predicting a flood should be the first man to climb a tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this would demonstrate that he was indeed a seer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moral vindication was regarded by the youth as a very important thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without salve he could not he though were the sore badge of his dishonor through life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with his heart continually assuring him that he was despicable he could not exist without making it through his actions apparent to all men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the army had gone gloriously on he would be lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the din meant that now his armys flags were tilted forward he was a condemned wretch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would be compelled to doom himself to isolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the men were advancing their indifferent feet were trampling upon his chances for a successful life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as these thoughts went rapidly through his mind he turned upon them and tried to thrust them away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that he was the most unutterably selfish man in existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mind pictured the soldiers who would place their defiant bodies before the spear of the yelling battle fiend and as he saw their dripping corpses on an imagined field he said that he was their murderer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he thought that he wished he was dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thinking of the slain he achieved a great contempt for some of them as if they were guilty for thus becoming lifeless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they might have been killed by lucky chances he said before they had had opportunities to flee or before they had been really tested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried out bitterly that their crowns were stolen and their robes of glorious memories were shams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however he still said that it was a great pity he was not as they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a defeat of the army had suggested itself to him as a means of escape from the consequences of his fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he considered now however that it was useless to think of such a possibility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his education had been that success for that might blue machine was certain that it would make victories as a contrivance turns out buttons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he presently discarded all his speculations in the other direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he was at last compelled to pay attention to them his capacity for selfhate was multiplied <end> <end>

<start> <start> he presently discarded all his speculations in the other direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he perceived again that it was not possible for the army to be defeated he tried to bethink him of a fine tale which he could take back to his regiment and with it turn the expected shafts of derision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as he mortally feared these shafts it became impossible for him to invent a tale he felt he could trust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he experimented with many schemes but threw them aside one by one as flimsy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was quick to see vulnerable places in them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> furthermore he was much afraid that some arrow of scorn might lay him mentally low before he could raise his protecting tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> britain i was hid for the best part of two years behind a bookstall ready to fly out if anybody pocketed a volume and after that i was light porter to a stay and mantua maker in which capacity i was employed to carry about in oilskin baskets nothing but deceptions which soured my spirits and disturbed my confidence in human nature and after that i heard a world of discussions in this house which soured my spirits fresh and my opinion after all is that as a safe and comfortable sweetener of the same and as a pleasant guide through life theres nothing clemency was about to offer a suggestion but he stopped her by anticipating it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do as you wold you know and cetrer eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observed clemency folding her arms comfortably in her delight at this avowal and im not sure said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> britain that its what would be considered good philosophy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive my doubts about that but it wears well and saves a quantity of snarling which the genuine see how you used to go on once yourself you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the most extraordinary thing clemmy is that i should live to be brought round through you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i suppose you havent so clemency without taking the least offence shook it and laughed im pretty sure of it said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont pretend to benjamin took his pipe from his lips and laughed till the tears ran down his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said shaking his head with an infinite relish of the joke and wiping his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clemency without the smallest inclination to dispute it did the like and laughed as heartily as he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> britain youre a regular good creature in your way so shake hands clem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> britain giving her his pipe to knock the ashes out of it ill stand by you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody dropping from the wall it sounded yes all abed by this time she replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the sound came nearer and nearer i was almost sure i could distinguish gingers step a little nearer still and i could tell she was in the dogcart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i neighed loudly and was overjoyed to hear an answering neigh from ginger and mens voices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came slowly over the stones and stopped at the dark figure that lay upon the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the men jumped out and stooped down over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is reuben he said and he does not stir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other man followed and bent over him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes dead he said feel how cold his hands are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they raised him up but there was no life and his hair was soaked with blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they laid him down again and came and looked at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the horse has been down and thrown him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who would have thought the black horse would have done that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reuben must have been lying here for hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> odd too that the horse has not moved from the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made a step but almost fell again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes bad in his foot as well as his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here his hoof is cut all to pieces he might well come down poor fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you what ned im afraid it hasnt been all right with reuben <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just think of his riding a horse over these stones without a shoe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why if he had been in his right senses he would just as soon have tried to ride him over the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid it has been the old thing over again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked awfully pale when she came to my house to ask if he had not come home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made believe she was not a bit anxious and talked of a lot of things that might have kept him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for all that she begged me to go and meet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres the horse to get home as well as the body and that will be no easy matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then followed a conversation between them till it was agreed that robert as the groom should lead me and that ned must take the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a hard job to get it into the dogcart for there was no one to hold ginger but she knew as well as i did what was going on and stood as still as a stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i noticed that because if she had a fault it was that she was impatient in standing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned started off very slowly with his sad load and robert came and looked at my foot again then he took his handkerchief and bound it closely round and so he led me home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall never forget that night walk it was more than three miles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robert led me on very slowly and i limped and hobbled on as well as i could with great pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure he was sorry for me for he often patted and encouraged me talking to me in a pleasant voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last i reached my own box and had some corn and after robert had wrapped up my knees in wet cloths he tied up my foot in a bran poultice to draw out the heat and cleanse it before the horsedoctor saw it in the morning and i managed to get myself down on the straw and slept in spite of the pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day after the farrier had examined my wounds he said he hoped the joint was not injured and if so i should not be spoiled for work but i should never lose the blemish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe they did the best to make a good cure but it was a long and painful one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> proud flesh as they called it came up in my knees and was burned out with caustic and when at last it was healed they put a blistering fluid over the front of both knees to bring all the hair off they had some reason for this and i suppose it was all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as smiths death had been so sudden and no one was there to see it there was an inquest held <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlord and hostler at the white lion with several other people gave evidence that he was intoxicated when he started from the inn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the keeper of the tollgate said he rode at a hard gallop through the gate and my shoe was picked up among the stones so that the case was quite plain to them and i was cleared of all blame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was nearly out of her mind she kept saying over and over again oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all that cursed drink why will they sell that cursed drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she went on till after he was buried and then as she had no home or relations she with her six little children was obliged once more to leave the pleasant home by the tall oaktrees and go into that great gloomy union house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as my knees were sufficiently healed i was turned into a small meadow for a month or two no other creature was there and though i enjoyed the liberty and the sweet grass yet i had been so long used to society that i felt very lonely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ginger and i had become fast friends and now i missed her company extremely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i often neighed when i heard horses feet passing in the road but i seldom got an answer till one morning the gate was opened and who should come in but dear old ginger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man slipped off her halter and left her there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a joyful whinny i trotted up to her we were both glad to meet but i soon found that it was not for our pleasure that she was brought to be with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her story would be too long to tell but the end of it was that she had been ruined by hard riding and was now turned off to see what rest would do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord george was young and would take no warning he was a hard rider and would hunt whenever he could get the chance quite careless of his horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon after i left the stable there was a steeplechase and he determined to ride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though the groom told him she was a little strained and was not fit for the race he did not believe it and on the day of the race urged ginger to keep up with the foremost riders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with her high spirit she strained herself to the utmost she came in with the first three horses but her wind was touched besides which he was too heavy for her and her back was strained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they began their wedded life under the shadow of the death out of which it grew and when after a ceremony in which neither bridesmaid nor groomsman stood by their side they united their divided homes it seemed to their neighbors that a separated husband and wife had come together again not that the relation was new to either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john vincent loved his wife with the tenderness of an innocent man but all his tenderness could not avail to lift the weight of settled melancholy which had gathered upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> disappointment waiting yearning indulgence in long lament and selfpity the morbid cultivation of unhappy fanciesall this had wrought its work upon her and it was too late to effect a cure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the night she awoke to weep at his side because of the years when she had awakened to weep alone by day she kept up her old habit of foreboding although the evening steadily refuted the morning and there were times when without any apparent cause she would fall into a dark despairing mood which her husbands greatest care and cunning could only slowly dispel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two or three years passed and new life came to the vincent farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day between midnight and dawn the family pair was doubled the cry of twin sons was heard in the hushed house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the father restrained his happy wonder in his concern for the imperilled life of the mother he guessed that she had anticipated death and she now hung by a thread so slight that her simple will might snap it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but her will fortunately was as faint as her consciousness she gradually drifted out of danger taking her returning strength with a passive acquiescence rather than with joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was hardly paler than her wont but the lurking shadow seemed to have vanished from her eyes and john vincent felt that her features had assumed a new expression the faintly perceptible stamp of some spiritual change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a happy day for him when propped against his breast and gently held by his warm strong arm the twin boys were first brought to be laid upon her lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two staring darkfaced creatures with restless fists and feet they were alike in every least feature of their grotesque animality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phebe placed a hand under the head of each and looked at them for a long time in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said at last taking hold of a narrow pink ribbon which was tied around the wrist of one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only by fifteen minutes or so but it generally makes a difference when twins come to be named and you may see with your own eyes that theres no telling of em apart otherways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take off the ribbon then said phebe quietly i know them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why maam its always done where theyre so like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ill never be able to tell which is which for they sleep and wake and feed by the same clock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you might mistake after all in giving em names there is no oldest or youngest john they are two and yet one this is mine and this is yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see no difference at all phebe said john and how can we divide them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will not divide she answered i only meant it as a sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she smiled for the first time in many days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was glad of heart but did not understand her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no john their names must be david and jonathan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they grew not less but more alike in passing through the stages of babyhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ribbon of the older one had been removed and the nurse would have been distracted but for phebes almost miraculous instinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the former comforted herself with the hope that teething would bring a variation to the two identical mouths but no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john after desperate attempts which always failed in spite of the headaches they gave him postponed the idea of distinguishing one from the other until they should be old enough to develop some dissimilarity of speech or gait or habit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all trouble might have been avoided had phebe consented to the least variation in their dresses but herein she was mildly immovable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not yet was her set reply to her husband and one day when he manifested a little annoyance at her persistence she turned to him holding a child on each knee and said with a gravity which silenced him thenceforth john can you not see that our burden has passed into them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there no meaning in thisthat two children who are one in body and face and nature should be given to us at our time of life after such long disappointment and trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our lives were held apart theirs were united before they were born and i dare not turn them in different directions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps i do not know all that the lord intended to say to us in sending them but his hand is here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was only thinking of their good john meekly answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they are spared to grow up there must be some way of knowing one from the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will not need it and i too think only of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have taken the cross from my heart and i will lay none on theirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am reconciled to my life through them john you have been very patient and good with me and i will yield to you in all things but in this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think i shall live to see them as men grown yet while we are together i feel clearly what it is right to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you not just once have a little faith without knowledge john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any way ill grant that the boys belong to you more than to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her attacks of semi hysterical despondency never returned her gloomy prophecies ceased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was still grave and the trouble of so many years never wholly vanished from her face but she performed every duty of her life with at least a quiet willingness and her home became the abode of peace for passive content wears longer than demonstrative happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david and jonathan grew as one boy the taste and temper of one was repeated in the other even as the voice and features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sleeping or waking grieved or joyous well or ill they lived a single life and it seemed so natural for one to answer to the others name that they probably would have themselves confused their own identities but for their mothers unerring knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps unconsciously guided by her perhaps through the voluntary action of their own natures each quietly took the others place when called upon even to the sharing of praise or blame at school the friendships and quarrels of the playground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were healthy and happy lads and john vincent was accustomed to say to his neighbors theyre no more trouble than one would be and yet theyre four hands instead of two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phebe died when they were fourteen saying to them with almost her latest breath be one always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before her husband could decide whether to change her plan of domestic education they were passing out of boyhood changing in voice stature and character with a continued likeness which bewildered and almost terrified him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he procured garments of different colors but they were accustomed to wear each article in common and the result was only a mixture of tints for both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were sent to different schools to be returned the next day equally pale suffering and incapable of study <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever device was employed they evaded it by a mutual instinct which rendered all external measures unavailing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to john vincents mind their resemblance was an accidental misfortune which had been confirmed through their mothers fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt that they were bound by some deep mysterious tie which inasmuch as it might interfere with all practical aspects of life ought to be gradually weakened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two bodies to him implied two distinct men and it was wrong to permit a mutual dependence which prevented either from exercising his own separate will and judgment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while he was planning and pondering the boys became young men and he was an old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old and prematurely broken for he had worked much borne much and his large frame held only a moderate measure of vital force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great weariness fell upon him and his powers began to give way at first slowly but then with accelerated failure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the end coming long before his sons suspected it his doubt for their sakes was the only thing which made it unwelcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was upon his mind as his quaker neighbors would say to speak to them of the future and at last the proper moment came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wind and rain whirled and drove among the trees outside but the sittingroom of the old farmhouse was bright and warm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david and jonathan at the table with their arms over each others backs and their brown locks mixed together read from the same book their father sat in the ancient rocking chair before the fire with his feet upon a stool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the housekeeper and hired man had gone to bed and all was still in the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john waited until he heard the volume closed and then spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not at all think that it is a fitting habit for young ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was you who advised us to imitate her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is it that you are drinking clara <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat down and rubbed his eyes as one who tries to shake off some evil dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all drink it in the profession which i am going to take up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> westmacott says that every woman should follow a calling and that we ought to choose those which women have always avoided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i am going to act upon her advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lights beacons buoys channels and landmarks of great britain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant think what a lot i have learned already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im to carry a green light to starboard and a red to port with a white light at the masthead and a flareup every fifteen minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one blast means that a ship steers to starboard two to port three astern four that it is unmanageable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this man asks such dreadful questions at the end of each chapter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> listen to this you see a red light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ship is on the port tack and the wind at north what course is that ship steering to a point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor rose with a gesture of despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant imagine what has come over you both said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear papa we are trying hard to live up to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i must say that i do not admire the result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your chemistry ida may perhaps do no harm but your scheme clara is out of the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how a girl of your sense could ever entertain such a notion is more than i can imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i must absolutely forbid you to go further with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but pa asked ida with an air of innocent inquiry in her big blue eyes what are we to do when your commands and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she says that when women try to throw off their shackles their fathers brothers and husbands are the very first to try to rivet them on again and that in such a matter no man has any authority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> westmacott teach you that i am not the head of my own house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor flushed and his grizzled hair bristled in his anger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she says that all heads of houses are relics of the dark ages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor muttered something and stamped his foot upon the carpet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then without a word he passed out into the garden and his daughters could see him striding furiously up and down cutting off the heads of the flowers with a switch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i saw the sorrow and surprise in his eyes i very nearly put my arms about him and told him all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is so funny that i should be leading you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we go an as we are doing we shall be able to say all our lives that we have saved him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if we dont oh clara we should never forgive ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isaac bradley aged fifteen was a small but active and vigorous boy his companion in captivity joseph whittaker was only eleven yet quite as large in size and heavier in his movements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh dyou know the most awful thing has happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear im you dont know what ive been through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps said i perhaps that is because they never get the chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a sort of power they have said daphne mercilessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they simply swarm all over some persons and its all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps said berry looking at me perhaps you have that power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can easily find out said berry eagerly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is i said just conceivable that i have that power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not recollect my immersion in the styx but it is i suppose not impossible that although i am not actually invulnerable my sterling qualities may yet be so apparent to the bee mind that even were i so indiscreet as to lay hands upon their hive they would not so far forget themselves as to assail me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time it is equally on the cards that the inmates of the hive i so foolishly approached would be a dull lot shall we say baeotian bees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or an impulsive lot who sting first and look for qualities afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short mistakes will occur and as an orphan and a useful member of society i must refuse to gratify your curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we want them to swarm awfully and they might actually swarm on you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no doubt that they would swarm on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then disobliging of me not to let them isnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we could have the funeral one day next week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well weve got to move them from the skep into the new hive tonight somehow said my sister and youve got to help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iil go up the road and send the traffic round by west hanger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont want to be hauled up for manslaughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hed better hold the skep i think she said simply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or keep the new hive steady while we shake the bees out of the skep into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve only got two veils but he wont want one for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course not said i with a bitter laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact i think id better wear a zephyr and running shorts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall be able to move with more freedom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the face and hands dont really matter but the back and legs...that might be dangerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not afraid of a bee or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like jonah to have my stopwatch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i walked across the lawn i heard the wretched girl reading toads are among the bees most deadly enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will sit at the mouth of a hive and snap up bees as fast as they emerge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> till then i had always been rather against toads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i well remember the day on which i learned of the purchase of the bees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been raining the night before and all day the clouds hung low and threatening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their actual advent i do not recollect for when i had heard that they were to arrive on saturday night i had made a point of going away for the weekend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on my return i avoided the kitchen garden assiduously for several days but after a while i began to get used to the presence of the bees and their old straw home i could see it from my bedroom looked rather pretty and comfortable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then daphne who never will leave ill alone had announced that they must be moved into a new hive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain i characterized her project as impious wanton and indecent in turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a new hive something resembling a swiss chalet was ordered and with it came two pairs of gauntlets and some veils which looked like meatsafes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at a distance of five paces this useful invention might have been mistaken for a small cannon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a matter of fact it consisted of a pair of bellows with the nozzle which was very large on the top instead of at the end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as touching the smoker the method of procedure was as follows one lighted a roll of brown paper blew it out again and placed it in the nozzle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then telling the gardeners boy to stand by with the salvolatile one began to blow the bellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately the instrument belched forth clouds of singularly offensive smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one might think that if this were done in the vicinity of a hive such a proceeding would tend to irritate the bees into a highly dangerous if warrantable frenzy and that they would take immediate steps to abate the nuisance in their own simple way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that my brothers is where we are wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where bees are concerned the smokers fumes are of a soporific and soothing nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed before a puff of its smoke a bees naughty malice and resentment disappear and the bee itself sinks gently humming into the peaceful contented slumber of a little cheild <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least that was what the books said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seven oclock that evening found us huddled apprehensively together outside the kitchen garden talking nervously about the budget <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fragrant blue smoke stole up gently from the smoker which i held at arms length <end> <end> 
<start> <start> berry and daphne were arrayed in veils and gauntlets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they reminded me irresistibly of tenniels tweedledum and tweedledee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mind youre ready with the smoker when i want it said berry shortly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i er i thought youd take it with you i said uneasily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must be ready to hand it to berry if the bees get infuriated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here said i im sure i shall do something wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and have to pay him hundreds of pounds compensation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the mention of compensation i started violently and dropped look here i said ill stand on the path and keep the beastly thing smoking and if if they should get er excited well er there itll be all ready for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall probably be just getting my second wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they looked at one another and sneered into their veils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stable clock chimed a quarter past seven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we entered the kitchen garden in single file <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all went well until berry was on the point of lifting the skep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly something jumped in the wallflowers by daphne and she started against her husband with a little scream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> physically he was not the man of iron muscles who had come down out of the arctic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not exercise sufficiently ate more than was good for him and drank altogether too much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his muscles were getting flabby and his tailor called attention to his increasing waistband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact daylight was developing a definite paunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this physical deterioration was manifest likewise in his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lean indian visage was suffering a city change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slight hollows in the cheeks under the high cheekbones had filled out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beginning of puffsacks under the eyes was faintly visible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girth of the neck had increased and the first crease and fold of a double chin were becoming plainly discernible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old effect of asceticism bred of terrific hardships and toil had vanished the features had become broader and heavier betraying all the stigmata of the life he lived advertising the mans selfindulgence harshness and brutality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> playing a lone hand contemptuous of most of the men with whom he played lacking in sympathy or understanding of them and certainly independent of them he found little in common with those to be encountered say at the altapacific <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in point of fact when the battle with the steamship companies was at its height and his raid was inflicting incalculable damage on all business interests he had been asked to resign from the altapacific <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea had been rather to his liking and he had found new quarters in clubs like the riverside organized and practically maintained by the city bosses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found that he really liked such men better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were more primitive and simple and they did not put on airs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were honest buccaneers frankly in the game for what they could get out of it on the surface more raw and savage but at least not glossed over with oily or graceful hypocrisy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the altapacific had suggested that his resignation be kept a private matter and then had privily informed the newspapers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter had made great capital out of the forced resignation but daylight had grinned and silently gone his way though registering a black mark against more than one club member who was destined to feel in the days to come the crushing weight of the klondikers financial paw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stormcentre of a combined newspaper attack lasting for months daylights character had been torn to shreds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no fact in his history that had not been distorted into a criminality or a vice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this public making of him over into an iniquitous monster had pretty well crushed any lingering hope he had of getting acquainted with dede mason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt that there was no chance for her ever to look kindly on a man of his caliber and beyond increasing her salary to seventyfive dollars a month he proceeded gradually to forget about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the increase was made known to her through morrison and later she thanked daylight and that was the end of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one weekend feeling heavy and depressed and tired of the city and its ways he obeyed the impulse of a whim that was later to play an important part in his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the desire to get out of the city for a whiff of country air and for a change of scene was the cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet to himself he made the excuse of going to glen ellen for the purpose of inspecting the brickyard with which holdsworthy had goldbricked him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spent the night in the little country hotel and on sunday morning astride a saddlehorse rented from the glen ellen butcher rode out of the village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brickyard was close at hand on the flat beside the sonoma creek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kilns were visible among the trees when he glanced to the left and caught sight of a cluster of wooded knolls half a mile away perched on the rolling slopes of sonoma mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trees on the knolls seemed to beckon to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dry earlysummer air shot through with sunshine was wine to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was jaded with all things business and the wooded knolls were calling to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a horse was between his legsa good horse he decided one that sent him back to the cayuses he had ridden during his eastern oregon boyhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been somewhat of a rider in those early days and the champ of bit and creak of saddleleather sounded good to him now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> resolving to have his fun first and to look over the brickyard afterward he rode on up the hill prospecting for a way across country to get to the knolls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left the country road at the first gate he came to and cantered through a hayfield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grain was waisthigh on either side the wagon road and he sniffed the warm aroma of it with delighted nostrils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> larks flew up before him and from everywhere came mellow notes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the appearance of the road it was patent that it had been used for hauling clay to the now idle brickyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> salving his conscience with the idea that this was part of the inspection he rode on to the claypita huge scar in a hillside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he did not linger long swinging off again to the left and leaving the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a farmhouse was in sight and the change from the city crowding was essentially satisfying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rode now through open woods across little flowerscattered glades till he came upon a spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flat on the ground he drank deeply of the clear water and looking about him felt with a shock the beauty of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it came to him like a discovery he had never realized it before he concluded and also he had forgotten much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could not sit in at high finance and keep track of such things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he drank in the air the scene and the distant song of larks he felt like a pokerplayer rising from a nightlong table and coming forth from the pent atmosphere to taste the freshness of the morn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the base of the knolls he encountered a tumbledown stakeandrider fence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the look of it he judged it must be forty years old at leastthe work of some first pioneer who had taken up the land when the days of gold had ended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the woods were very thick here yet fairly clear of underbrush so that while the blue sky was screened by the arched branches he was able to ride beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he now found himself in a nook of several acres where the oak and manzanita and madrono gave way to clusters of stately redwoods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> against the foot of a steepsloped knoll he came upon a magnificent group of redwoods that seemed to have gathered about a tiny gurgling spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he halted his horse for beside the spring uprose a wild california lily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a wonderful flower growing there in the cathedral nave of lofty trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least eight feet in height its stem rose straight and slender green and bare for twothirds its length and then burst into a shower of snowwhite waxen bells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were hundreds of these blossoms all from the one stem delicately poised and ethereally frail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly his gaze wandered from it to all that was about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took off his hat with almost a vague religious feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was clean and fresh and beautifulsomething he could respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here man felt the prompting of nobler things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> much of this and more was in daylights heart as he looked about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was not a concept of his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he merely felt it without thinking about it at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the steep incline above the spring grew tiny maidenhair ferns while higher up were larger ferns and brakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great mosscovered trunks of fallen trees lay here and there slowly sinking back and merging into the level of the forest mould <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond in a slightly clearer space wild grape and honeysuckle swung in green riot from gnarled old oak trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gray douglas squirrel crept out on a branch and watched him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from somewhere came the distant knocking of a woodpecker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quiet woods noises belonged there and made the solitude complete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tiny bubbling ripple of the spring and the gray flash of treesquirrel were as yardsticks with which to measure the silence and motionless repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> might be a million miles from anywhere daylight whispered to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ever his gaze returned to the wonderful lily beside the bubbling spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tethered the horse and wandered on foot among the knolls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their tops were crowned with centuryold spruce trees and their sides clothed with oaks and madronos and native holly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to the perfect redwoods belonged the small but deep canon that threaded its way among the knolls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he found no passage out for his horse and he returned to the lily beside the spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on foot tripping stumbling leading the animal he forced his way up the hillside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ever the ferns carpeted the way of his feet ever the forest climbed with him and arched overhead and ever the clean joy and sweetness stole in upon his senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the crest he came through an amazing thicket of velvettrunked young madronos and emerged on an open hillside that led down into a tiny valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sunshine was at first dazzling in its brightness and he paused and rested for he was panting from the exertion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not of old had he known shortness of breath such as this and muscles that so easily tired at a stiff climb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a tiny stream ran down the tiny valley through a tiny meadow that was carpeted kneehigh with grass and blue and white nemophila <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hillside was covered with mariposa lilies and wild hyacinth down through which his horse dropped slowly with circumspect feet and reluctant gait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crossing the stream daylight followed a faint cattle trail over a low rocky hill and through a winewooded forest of manzanita and emerged upon another tiny valley down which filtered another springfed meadowbordered streamlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a jackrabbit bounded from a bush under his horses nose leaped the stream and vanished up the opposite hillside of scruboak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> daylight watched it admiringly as he rode on to the head of the meadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he startled up a manypronged buck that seemed to soar across the meadow and to soar over the stakeandrider fence and still soaring disappeared in a friendly copse beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him that he had never been so happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his old woods training was aroused and he was keenly interested in everything in the moss on the trees and branches in the bunches of mistletoe hanging in the oaks in the nest of a woodrat in the watercress growing in the sheltered eddies of the little stream in the butterflies drifting through the rifted sunshine and shadow in the blue jays that flashed in splashes of gorgeous color across the forest aisles in the tiny birds like wrens that hopped among the bushes and imitated certain minor quailcalls and in the crimsoncrested woodpecker that ceased its knocking and cocked its head on one side to survey him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crossing the stream he struck faint vestiges of a woodroad used evidently a generation back when the meadow had been cleared of its oaks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found a hawks nest on the lightningshattered tipmost top of a sixfoot redwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to complete it all his horse stumbled upon several large broods of halfgrown quail and the air was filled with the thrum of their flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he halted and watched the young ones petrifying and disappearing on the ground before his eyes and listening to the anxious calls of the old ones hidden in the thickets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it sure beats country places and bungalows at menlo park he communed aloud and if ever i get the hankering for country life its me for this every time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old woodroad led him to a clearing where a dozen acres of grapes grew on winered soil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cowpath more trees and thickets and he dropped down a hillside to the southeast exposure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here poised above a big forested canon and looking out upon sonoma valley was a small farmhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with its barn and outhouses it snuggled into a nook in the hillside which protected it from west and north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the erosion from this hillside he judged that had formed the little level stretch of vegetable garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the soil was fat and black and there was water in plenty for he saw several faucets running wide open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody was at home but daylight dismounted and ranged the vegetable garden eating strawberries and green peas inspecting the old adobe barn and the rusty plough and harrow and rolling and smoking cigarettes while he watched the antics of several broods of young chickens and the mother hens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the minister the cousin teresa man of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think every one would be pleased if we knighted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes you can put him down on the list of certainties under the letter l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the letter l said the secretary who was new to his job does that stand for liberalism or liberality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the recipients of ministerial favour were expected to qualify in both of those subjects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thus after a fashion colonel harrowcluffs expectation of seeing his sons name in the list of honours was gratified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir lulworth quayne was making a leisurely progress through the zoological societys gardens in company with his nephew recently returned from mexico <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter was interested in comparing and contrasting allied types of animals occurring in the north american and old world fauna <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the most remarkable things in the wanderings of species he observed is the sudden impulse to trek and migrate that breaks out now and again for no apparent reason in communities of hitherto stayathome animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in human affairs the same phenomenon is occasionally noticeable said sir lulworth perhaps the most striking instance of it occurred in this country while you were away in the wilds of mexico <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean the wander fever which suddenly displayed itself in the managing and editorial staffs of certain london newspapers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it began with the stampede of the entire staff of one of our most brilliant and enterprising weeklies to the banks of the seine and the heights of montmartre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the migration was a brief one but it heralded an era of restlessness in the press world which lent quite a new meaning to the phrase newspaper circulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other editorial staffs were not slow to imitate the example that had been set them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paris soon dropped out of fashion as being too near home nurnberg seville and salonica became more favoured as planting out grounds for the personnel of not only weekly but daily papers as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the localities were perhaps not always well chosen the fact of a leading organ of evangelical thought being edited for two successive fortnights from trouville and monte carlo was generally admitted to have been a mistake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and even when enterprising and adventurous editors took themselves and their staffs further afield there were some unavoidable clashings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance the scrutator sporting bluff and the damsels own paper all pitched on khartoum for the same week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was perhaps a desire to outdistance all possible competition that influenced the management of the daily intelligencer one of the most solid and respected organs of liberal opinion in its decision to transfer its offices for three or four weeks from fleet street to eastern turkestan allowing of course a necessary margin of time for the journey there and back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was in many respects the most remarkable of all the press stampedes that were experienced at this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no makebelieve about the undertaking proprietor manager editor subeditors leaderwriters principal reporters and so forth all took part in what was popularly alluded to as the drang nach osten an intelligent and efficient officeboy was all that was left in the deserted hive of editorial industry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was doing things rather thoroughly wasnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you see said sir lulworth the migration idea was falling somewhat into disrepute from the half hearted manner in which it was occasionally carried out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were not impressed by the information that such and such a paper was being edited and brought out at lisbon or innsbruck if you chanced to see the principal leader writer or the art editor lunching as usual at their accustomed restaurants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the daily intelligencer was determined to give no loophole for cavil at the genuineness of its pilgrimage and it must be admitted that to a certain extent the arrangements made for transmitting copy and carrying on the usual features of the paper during the long outward journey worked smoothly and well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the series of articles which commenced at baku on what cobdenism might do for the camel industry ranks among the best of the recent contributions to free trade literature while the views on foreign policy enunciated from a roof in yarkand showed at least as much grasp of the international situation as those that had germinated within half a mile of downing street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite in keeping too with the older and better traditions of british journalism was the manner of the homecoming no bombast no personal advertisement no flamboyant interviews <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even a complimentary luncheon at the voyagers club was courteously declined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed it began to be felt that the selfeffacement of the returned pressmen was being carried to a pedantic length <end> <end> 
<start> <start> foreman compositors advertisement clerks and other members of the non editorial staff who had of course taken no part in the great trek found it as impossible to get into direct communication with the editor and his satellites now that they had returned as when they had been excusably inaccessible in central asia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sulky overworked officeboy who was the one connecting link between the editorial brain and the business departments of the paper sardonically explained the new aloofness as the yarkand manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the reporters and subeditors seemed to have been dismissed in autocratic fashion since their return and new ones engaged by letter to these the editor and his immediate associates remained an unseen presence issuing its instructions solely through the medium of curt typewritten notes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something mystic and tibetan and forbidden had replaced the human bustle and democratic simplicity of premigration days and the same experience was encountered by those who made social overtures to the returned wanderers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most brilliant hostess of twentieth century london flung the pearl of her hospitality into the unresponsive trough of the editorial letterbox it seemed as if nothing short of a royal command would drag the hermitsouled revenants from their selfimposed seclusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people began to talk unkindly of the effect of high altitudes and eastern atmosphere on minds and temperaments unused to such luxuries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the contents of the paper said the nephew did they show the influence of the new style <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said sir lulworth that was the exciting thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in home affairs social questions and the ordinary events of the day not much change was noticeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain oriental carelessness seemed to have crept into the editorial department and perhaps a note of lassitude not unnatural in the work of men who had returned from what had been a fairly arduous journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the aforetime standard of excellence was scarcely maintained but at any rate the general lines of policy and outlook were not departed from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in the realm of foreign affairs that a startling change took place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blunt forcible outspoken articles appeared couched in language which nearly turned the autumn manoeuvres of six important powers into mobilisations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever else the daily intelligencer had learned in the east it had not acquired the art of diplomatic ambiguity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see she likes to have people come and stop with us people who know things and can talkpeople like you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she delights in it for she knowsoh she knows nearly everything herself and can talk oh like a birdand the books she reads why you would be astonished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont go its only a little while you know and shell be so disappointed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard the words but hardly noticed them i was so deep in my thinkings and strugglings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently he was back with the picture case in his hand and he there now tell her to her face you could have stayed to see her and you wouldnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that second glimpse broke down my good resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night we smoked the tranquil pipe and talked till late about various things but mainly about her and certainly i had had no such pleasant and restful time for many a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toward twilight a big miner from three miles away cameone of the grizzled stranded pioneersand gave us warm salutation i only just dropped over to ask about the little madam and when is she coming home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i should think i would if you dont mind henry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry got the letter out of his wallet and said he would skip some of the private phrases if we were willing then he went on and read the bulk of ita loving sedate and altogether charming and gracious piece of handiwork with a postscript full of affectionate regards and messages to tom and joe and charley and other close friends and neighbors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take your hands away and let me see your eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you always do that when i read a letter from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im getting old you know and any little disappointment makes me want to cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought shed be here herself and now youve got only a letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well now what put that in your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought everybody knew she wasnt coming till saturday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why come to think i did know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder whats the matter with me lately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ill be on hand when she comes old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> late friday afternoon another gray veteran tramped over from his cabin a mile or so away and said the boys wanted to have a little gaiety and a good time saturday night if henry thought she wouldnt be too tired after her journey to be kept up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joe you know shed sit up six weeks to please any one of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when joe heard that there was a letter he asked to have it read and the loving messages in it for him broke the old fellow all up but he said he was such an old wreck that that would happen to him if she only just mentioned his name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> saturday afternoon i found i was taking out my watch pretty often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont think she ought to be here soon do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt caught and a little embarrassed but i laughed and said it was a habit of mine when i was in a state of expenctancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he didnt seem quite satisfied and from that time on he began to show uneasiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four times he walked me up the road to a point whence we could see a long distance and there he would stand im getting worried im getting right down worried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know shes not due till about nine oclock and yet something seems to be trying to warn me that somethings happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont think anything has happened do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to get pretty thoroughly ashamed of him for his childishness and at last when he repeated that imploring question still another time i lost my patience for the moment and spoke pretty brutally to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to shrivel him up and cow him and he looked so wounded and so humble after that that i detested myself for having done the cruel and unnecessary thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so i was glad when charley another veteran arrived toward the edge of the evening and nestled up to henry to hear the letter read and talked over the preparations for the welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley fetched out one hearty speech after another and did his best to drive away his friends bodings and apprehensions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there isnt anything going to happen to her just make your mind easy as to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and said shed be here by nine oclock didnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you ever know her to fail of her word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then dont you fret shell be here and thats absolutely certain and as sure as you are born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come now lets get to decorating not much time left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pretty soon tom and joe arrived and then all hands set about adoring the house with flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toward nine the three miners said that as they had brought their instruments they might as well tune up for the boys and girls would soon be arriving now and hungry for a good oldfashioned breakdown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fiddle a banjo and a clarinet these were the instruments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trio took their places side by side and began to play some rattling dancemusic and beat time with their big boots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry was standing in the door with his eyes directed up the road his body swaying to the torture of his mental distress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been made to drink his wifes all hands stand by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joe brought the glasses on a waiter and served the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reached for one of the two remaining glasses but joe growled drop that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock began to strike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened till it finished boys im sick with fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to nestle and drowse but presently spoke like one talking in his sleep and said did i hear horses feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the veterans answered close to his ear it was jimmy parish come to say the party got delayed but theyre right up the road a piece and coming along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her horse is lame but shell be here in half an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment those handy men had his clothes off and had tucked him into his bed in the chamber where i had washed my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they seemed preparing to leave but i said please dont go gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wont know me i am a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went to see her folks half a year after she was married and on her way back on a saturday evening the indians captured her within five miles of this place and shes never been heard of since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he only gets bad when that time of year comes round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we begin to drop in here three days before shes due to encourage him up and ask if hes heard from her and saturday we all come and fix up the house with flowers and get everything ready for a dance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve done it every year for nineteen years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first saturday there was twentyseven of us without counting the girls theres only three of us now and the girls are gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we drug him to sleep or he would go wild then hes all right for another yearthinks shes with him till the last three or four days come round then he begins to look for her and gets out his poor old letter and we come and ask him to read it to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once or twice a year i get a letter of a certain pattern a pattern that never materially changes in form and substance yet i cannot get used to that letterit always astonishes me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it affects me as the locomotive always affects me i saw to myself i have seen you a thousand times you always look the same way yet you are always a wonder and you are always impossible to contrive you is clearly beyond human geniusyou cant exist you dont exist yet here you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a letter of that kind by me a very old one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill be bound id have got a patent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you what you ought to turn your talents to account said his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want sympathy love can one buy that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is only one sort of woman to be bought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well come and see me sometimes wont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well no im very much obliged to you but i dont think i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have lots of rich men come to my house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd find it to your advantage if youd come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could make big money together if he paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall have to wait to get a little richer before i can afford it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you what come up to dinner tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to have a fellow there an awfully rich fellow want to interest him in some things and ive invited him down <end> <end>

<start> <start> that fellows either a fool or he is crazy said his friend gazing after him as he walked away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if hed let me use him i could make money out of him for both of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not long before floyd began to be known more widely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had schemes for the amelioration of the condition of the poor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were pronounced quixotic but he kept on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said he got good out of them if no one else did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were so many standing round me rigging me up that i didnt get a glimpse of the mirror till the second before ginger called me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in that secondin that second mag monahan i saw a fairy with blazing cheeks and shining eyes with a diamond coronet in her brown hair puffed high and pearls on her bare neck and arms and emeralds over the waist and rubies and pearls on her fingers and sprays of diamonds like frost on the lace of her skirt and diamond buckles on her very slippers and the rose diamond like a sun outshining all the rest andand mag it was me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well wouldnt it make you think you were a lady sure enough if you couldnt move without that lace train billowing after you without being dazzled with diamondshine without a truly lord tagging after you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kept his head lord harold dideven if it is a muttonhead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was so cold so stupid so slow so i tell you mag monahan theres one thing thats stronger than wine to a womanits being beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew it before i got that quick hush with the full applause after it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and because i was beautiful i got saucy and then calm and then i caught fred obermullers voicehe had taken the book from the prompter and stood there himselfand after that it was easy sailing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was there yet when the act was over and i trailed out followed by my lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he let the promptbook fall from his hands and reached them both out to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i flirted my jeweled fan at him and swept him a courtesy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was daffy with the sight of me in all that glory and i knew it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nance he whispered you wonderful girl if i didnt know about that little thief up at the bronsonia idid marry you alive just for the fun of piling pretty things on you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sailed past him with topham and my lord in my wake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they didnt leave me till theyd stripped me clean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt like a christmas tree the day after <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its about time you came home to look after me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why didnt i tell you the very day we took this flat what a chaperon was and that youd have to be mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit down maggie there and let me get the stool and talk to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think of us twocruelty girls both of ustwo mangy kittens deserted by the old cats in a citys alleys and left mewing with cold and hunger and dirt out in the wetthink of us two in our own flat mag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say it makes me proud of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are times when i look at every stick of furniture we own and i try to pretend to it all that im used to a decent roof over my head and a diningroom kitchen parlor bedroom and bath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh and i forgot the telephone the other tenant left here till its lease is up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at other times i stand here in the middle of it and cry out to it in my look at me nancy olden a householder a rentpayer the head of the family even if its only a family of two and the other one mag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at me with my name in the directory apaying milk bills and meat bills and bread bills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at me with a place of my own where nobodys rights greater than my own where no one has a right but me and mag a place wherewhere theres nothing to hide from the police <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres the rub mag as hamlet saysi went to see it the other night so that i could take off the opheliashe used to be a good mimic herself before she tried to be a leading lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it spoils you this sense of safeness that goes with the honesty graft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you lose the quickness of the hunter and the nerve of the hunted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> andworseyou lose your taste for the old risky life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you grow proud and fat and you love every stick in the dear quiet little place thats your homeyour own home <end> <end>

<start> <start> maggie dont you wish tom was a ventriloquist oror an acrobat orbut this isnt what i had to tell you <end> <end>

<start> <start> it isnt such a bad graft andand this is just between us two mindthat little beggar tausig has begun his tricks since you turned his offer down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they can make things hot for me and if they do it wont be so bad for you to go in for this sort of thingunless you go over to the trust i shook my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for as saith one of the saints he that hath made fervent his understanding and hath lift up his soul and migrated to heaven and hath thus called upon his master and remembered his own sins and spoken concerning the forgiveness of the same and with hot tears hath besought the lover of mankind to be merciful to him such an one i say by his continuance in such words and considerations layeth aside every care of this life and waxeth superior to human passions and meriteth to be called an associate of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> than which state what can be more blessed and higher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may the lord vouchsafe thee to attain to this blessedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lo i have shown thee the way of the commandments of the lord and have not shunned to declare unto thee all the counsel of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now i have fulfilled my ministry unto thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it remaineth that thou gird up the loins of thy mind obedient to the holy one that hath called thee and be thou thyself holy in all manner of conversation for be ye holy for i am holy saith the lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the chief prince of the apostles also writeth saying if ye call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every mans work pass the time of your sojourning here in fear knowing that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of all these things therefore store thou up in thine heart and remember them unceasingly ever keeping before thine eyes the fear of god and his terrible judgement seat and the splendour of the righteous which they shall receive in the world to come and the shame of sinners in the depths of darkness and the frailty and vanity of things present and the eternity of things hereafter for all flesh is grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the lord endureth for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meditate upon these things alway and the peace of god be with thee enlightening and informing thee and leading thee into the way of salvation chasing afar out of thy mind every evil wish and sealing thy soul with the sign of the cross that no stumbling block of the evil one come nigh thee but that thou mayest merit in all fulness of virtue to obtain the kingdom that is to come without end or successor and be illumined with the light of the blessed lifegiving trinity which in the father and in the son and in the holy ghost is glorified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with such moral words did the reverend elder exhort the kings son and then withdrew to his own hospice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the young princes servants and tutors marvelled to see the frequency of barlaams visits to the palace and one of the chiefest among them whom for his fidelity and prudence the king had set over his sons palace named zardan said to the prince thou knowest well sir how much i dread thy father and how great is my faith toward him wherefore he ordered me for my faithfulness to wait upon thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now when i see this stranger constantly conversing with thee i fear he may be of the christian religion toward which thy father hath a deadly hate and i shall be found subject to the penalty of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either then make known to thy father this mans business or in future cease to converse with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> else cast me forth from thy presence that i be not blameable and ask thy father to appoint another in my room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kings son said unto him this do zardan first of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit thou down behind the curtain and hear his communication with me and then thus will i tell thee what thou oughtest to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so when barlaam was about to enter into his presence ioasaph hid zardan within the curtain and said to the elder sum me up the matter of thy divine teaching that it may the more firmly be implanted in my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barlaam took up his parable and uttered many sayings touching god and righteousness toward him and how we must love him alone with all our heart and with all our soul and with all our mind and keep his commandments with fear and loveand how he is the maker of all things visible and invisible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereon he called to remembrance the creation of the first man the command given unto him and his transgression thereof and the sentence pronounced by the creator for this transgression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he reckoned up in order the good things wherefrom we excluded ourselves by the disannulling of his commandment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he made mention of the many grievous misfortunes that unhappily overtook man after the loss of the blessings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides this he brought forward gods love toward mankind how our maker heedful of our salvation sent forth teachers and prophets proclaiming the incarnation of the onlybegotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he spake of the son his dwelling among men his deeds of kindness his miracles his sufferings for us thankless creatures his cross his spear his voluntary death finally of our recovery and recall our return to our first good estate after this of the kingdom of heaven awaiting such as are worthy thereof of the torment in store for the wicked the fire that is not quenched the never ending darkness the undying worm and all the other tortures which the slaves of sin have laid up in store for themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had fully related these matters he ended his speech with moral instruction and dwelt much upon purity of life and utterly condemned the vanity of things present and proved the utter misery of such as cleave thereto and finally made an end with prayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therewith he prayed for the prince that he might hold fast the profession of the catholick faith without turning and without wavering and keep his life blameless and his conversation pure and so ending with prayer again withdrew to his hospice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the kings son called zardan forth and to try his disposition said unto him thou hast heard what sort of discourses this babbler maketh me endeavouring to bejape me with his specious follies and rob me of this pleasing happiness and enjoyment to worship a strange god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> zardan answered why hath it pleased thee o prince to prove me that am thy servant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wot that the words of that man have sunk deep into thine heart for otherwise thou hadst not listened gladly and unceasingly to his words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea and we also are not ignorant of this preaching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but from the time when thy father stirred up truceless warfare against the christians the men have been banished hence and their teaching is silenced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if now their doctrine commend itself unto thee and if thou have the strength to accept its austerity may thy wishes be guided straight toward the good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for myself what shall i do that am unable to bear the very sight of such austerity and through fear of the king am divided in soul with pain and anguish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what excuse shall i make for neglecting his orders and giving this fellow access unto thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kings son said unto him i knew full well that in none other wise could i requite thee worthily for thy much kindness and therefore have i tasked myself to make known unto thee this more than human good which doth even exceed the worth of thy good service that thou mightest know to what end thou wast born and acknowledge thy creator and leaving darkness run to the light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i hoped that when thou heardest thereof thou wouldst follow it with irresistible desire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as i perceive i am disappointed of my hope seeing that thou art listless to that which hath been spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if thou reveal these secrets to the king my father thou shalt but distress his mind with sorrows and griefs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if thou be well disposed to him on no account reveal this matter to him until a convenient season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speaking thus he seemed to be only casting seed upon the water for wisdom shall not enter into a soul void of understanding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the morrow came barlaam and spake of his departure but ioasaph unable to bear the separation was distressed at heart and his eyes filled with tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elder made a long discourse and adjured him to continue unshaken in good works and with words of exhortation established his heart and begged him to send him cheerfully on his way and at the same time he foretold that they should shortly be at one never to be parted more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tripped and over he went on the sand the indefatigable dick beating him with a little switch he had picked up to make him continue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im better now but im near wore out said mr button sitting up on the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but bedad if im chased by any more things like them its into the say ill be dashin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took dicks arm and wandered over to the shade of the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he threw himself down and told the children to leave him to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they recognised that the game was over and left him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he slept for six hours on end it was the first real sleep he had had for several days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he awoke he was well but very shaky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr button saw no more rats much to dicks disappointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at dawn next day he got up refreshed by a second sleep and wandered down to the edge of the lagoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the opening in the reef faced the east and the light of the dawn came rippling in with the flooding tide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a baste ive been said the repentant one a brute baste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was quite wrong as a matter of fact he was only a man beset and betrayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood for a while cursing the drink and them that sells it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he determined to put himself out of the way of temptation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pull the bung out of the barrel and let the contents escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a thought never even occurred to himor if it did was instantly dismissed for though an old sailorman may curse the drink good rum is to him a sacred thing and to empty half a little barrel of it into the sea would be an act almost equivalent to childmurder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put the cask into the dinghy and rowed it over to the reef <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he placed it in the shelter of a great lump of coral and rowed back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paddy had been trained all his life to rhythmical drunkenness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four months or so had generally elapsed between his boutssome times six it all depended on the length of the voyage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six months now elapsed before he felt even an inclination to look at the rum cask that tiny dark spot away on the reef <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was just as well for during those six months another whaleship arrived watered and was avoided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he the say here seems to breed whaleships and nothin but whaleships <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its like bugs in a bed you kill wan and then another comes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howsumever were shut of thim for a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked down to the lagoon edge looked at the little dark spot and whistled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that little dark spot began to trouble him after a while not it but the spirit it contained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> days grew long and weary the days that had been so short and pleasant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the children there was no such thing as time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having absolute and perfect health they enjoyed happiness as far as mortals can enjoy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emmelines highly strung nervous system it is true developed a headache when she had been too long in the glare of the sun but they were few and far between <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spirit in the little cask had been whispering across the lagoon for some weeks at last it began to shout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he busied himself with the children as much as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made another garment for emmeline and cut dicks hair with the scissors a job which was generally performed once in a couple of months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night to keep the rum from troubling his head he told them the story of jack dogherty and the merrow which is well known on the western coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the merrow takes jack to dinner at the bottom of the sea and shows him the lobster pots wherein he keeps the souls of old sailormen and then they have dinner and the merrow produces a big bottle of rum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a fatal story for him to remember and recount for after his companions were asleep the vision of the merrow and jack hobnobbing and the idea of the jollity of it rose before him and excited a thirst for joviality not to be resisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were some green cocoanuts that he had plucked that day lying in a little heap under a treehalf a dozen or so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took several of these and a shell found the dinghy where it was moored to the aoa tree unmoored her and pushed off into the lagoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lagoon and sky were full of stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the dark depths of the water might have been seen phosphorescent gleams of passing fish and the thunder of the surf on the reef filled the night with its song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fixed the boats painter carefully round a spike of coral and landed on the reef and with a shellful of rum and cocoanut lemonade mixed half and half he took his perch on a high ledge of coral from whence a view of the sea and the coral strand could be obtained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a moonlight night it was fine to sit here and watch the great breakers coming in all marbled and clouded and rainbowed with spindrift and sheets of spray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the snow and the song of them under the diffused light of the stars produced a more indescribably beautiful and strange effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tide was going out now and mr button as he sat smoking his pipe and drinking his grog could see bright mirrors here and there where the water lay in rockpools <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had contemplated these sights for a considerable time in complete contentment he returned to the lagoon side of the reef and sat down beside the little barrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then after a while if you had been standing on the strand opposite you would have heard scraps of song borne across the quivering water of the lagoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sailing down sailing down on the coast of barbaree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether the coast of barbary in question is that at san francisco or the true and proper coast does not matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is an oldtime song and when you hear it whether on a reef of coral or a granite quay you may feel assured that an oldtime sailorman is singing it and that the oldtime sailorman is bemused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the dinghy put off from the reef the sculls broke the starlit waters and great shaking circles of light made rhythmical answer to the slow and steady creak of the thole pins against the leather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tied up to the aoa saw that the sculls were safely shipped then breathing heavily he cast off his boots for fear of waking the childer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the children were sleeping more than two hundred yards away this was a needless precaution especially as the intervening distance was mostly soft sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> green cocoanut juice and rum mixed together are pleasant enough to drink but they are better drunk separately combined not even the brain of an old sailor can make anything of them but mist and muddlement that is to say in the way of thoughtin the way of action they can make him do a lot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here there was no great difference in size and though the man fighting with sword and dagger against a bill and being wary and quick of fence had a certain superiority of arms dick more than made it up by his greater agility on foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither at first gained any obvious advantage but the older man was still insensibly profiting by the ardour of the younger to lead him where he would and presently dick found that they had crossed the whole width of the beach and were now fighting above the knees in the spume and bubble of the breakers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here his own superior activity was rendered useless he found himself more or less at the discretion of his foe yet a little and he had his back turned upon his own men and saw that this adroit and skilful adversary was bent upon drawing him farther and farther away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he determined to decide the combat instantly and when the wash of the next wave had ebbed and left them dry he rushed in caught a blow upon his bill and leaped right at the throat of his opponent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man went down backwards with dick still upon the top of him and the next wave speedily succeeding to the last buried him below a rush of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he was still submerged dick forced his dagger from his grasp and rose to his feet victorious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i yield me said the other getting to his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye fight like a young man ignorantly and foolhardily but by the array of the saints ye fight bravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the combat was still raging doubtfully in the night over the hoarse roar of the breakers steel clanged upon steel and cries of pain and the shout of battle resounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lead me to your captain youth said the conquered knight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir replied dick so far as these brave fellows have a captain the poor gentleman who here addresses you is he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> call off your dogs then and i will bid my villains hold returned the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something noble both in the voice and manner of his late opponent and dick instantly dismissed all fears of treachery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have yielded me upon promise of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tone of the stranger was one of absolute command and almost instantly the din and confusion of the mellay ceased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would go ill with me if he were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay then if ye be not of sir daniels party i profess i comprehend no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in what quarrel my young and very fiery friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to make a clear end of questioning to what good gentleman have i surrendered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before dick could answer a voice spoke in the darkness from close by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dick could see the speakers black and white badge and the respectful salute which he addressed to his superior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lord said he if these gentlemen be unfriends to sir daniel it is pity indeed we should have been at blows with them but it were tenfold greater that either they or we should linger here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the watchers in the house unless they be all dead or deaf have heard our hammering this quarterhour agone instantly they will have signalled to the town and unless we be the livelier in our departure we are like to be taken both of us by a fresh foe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hawksley is in the right added the lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay my lord said dick go where ye will for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do begin to suspect we have some ground of friendship and if indeed i began our acquaintance somewhat ruggedly i would not churlishly continue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us then separate my lord you laying your right hand in mine and at the hour and place that ye shall name let us encounter and agree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> y are too trustful boy said the other but this time your trust is not misplaced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will meet you at the point of day at st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strangers disappeared from the scene with a rapidity that seemed suspicious and while the outlaws fell to the congenial task of rifling the dead bodies dick made once more the circuit of the garden wall to examine the front of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a little upper loophole of the roof he beheld a light set and as it would certainly be visible in town from the back windows of sir daniels mansion he doubted not that this was the signal feared by hawksley and that ere long the lances of the knight of tunstall would arrive upon the scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put his ear to the ground and it seemed to him as if he heard a jarring and hollow noise from townward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the work was already done the last body was disarmed and stripped to the skin and four fellows were already wading seaward to commit it to the mercies of the deep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few minutes later when there debauched out of the nearest lanes of shoreby some two score horsemen hastily arrayed and moving at the gallop of their steeds the neighbourhood of the house beside the sea was entirely silent and deserted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile dick and his men had returned to the alehouse of the goat and bagpipes to snatch some hours of sleep before the morning tryst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brides cross stood a little way back from shoreby on the skirts of tunstall forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two roads met one from holywood across the forest one that road from risingham down which we saw the wrecks of a lancastrian army fleeing in disorder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the two joined issue and went on together down the hill to shoreby and a little back from the point of junction the summit of a little knoll was crowned by the ancient and weatherbeaten cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here then about seven in the morning dick arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as cold as ever the earth was all grey and silver with the hoarfrost and the day began to break in the east with many colours of purple and orange <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dick set him down upon the lowest step of the cross wrapped himself well in his tabard and looked vigilantly upon all sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down the road from holywood a gentleman in very rich and bright armour and wearing over that a surcoat of the rarest furs came pacing on a splendid charger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twenty yards behind him followed a clump of lances but these halted as soon as they came in view of the trystingplace while the gentleman in the fur surcoat continued to advance alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his visor was raised and showed a countenance of great command and dignity answerable to the richness of his attire and arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was with some confusion of manner that dick arose from the cross and stepped down the bank to meet his prisoner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thank you my lord for your exactitude he said louting very low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will it please your lordship to set foot to earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not so simple answered dick and to be plain with your lordship the woods upon either hand of this cross lie full of mine honest fellows lying on their weapons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it pleaseth me the rather since last night ye fought foolhardily and more like a salvage saracen lunatic than any christian warrior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it becomes not me to complain that had the undermost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye had the undermost indeed my lord since ye so fell returned dick but had the waves not holpen me it was i that should have had the worst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye were pleased to make me yours with several dagger marks which i still carry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in fine my lord methinks i had all the danger as well as all the profit of that little blindmans mellay on the beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> round and round the tree of gold round and round dance we so doth the great world spin from of old summer and winter and fire and cold song that is sung and tale that is told even as we dance that fold and unfold round the stem of the fairy tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these grave dancing fairies were very unlike the grey women and they were glad to see the boy and treated him kindly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they asked him why he had come and he told them how he was sent to find the sword of sharpness and the cap of darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the fairies gave him these and a wallet and a shield and belted the sword which had a diamond blade round his waist and the cap they set on his head and told him that now even they could not see him though they were fairies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he took it off and they each kissed him and wished him good fortune and then they began again their eternal dance round the golden tree for it is their business to guard it till the new times come or till the worlds ending <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the boy put the cap on his head and hung the wallet round his waist and the shining shield on his shoulders and flew beyond the great river that lies coiled like a serpent round the whole world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by the banks of that river there he found the three terrible women all asleep beneath a poplar tree and the dead poplar leaves lay all about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their golden wings were folded and their brass claws were crossed and two of them slept with their hideous heads beneath their wings like birds and the serpents in their hair writhed out from under the feathers of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the youngest slept between her two sisters and she lay on her back with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky and though she slept her eyes were wide open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it she was so awful but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as he caught sight of the three from far off he took his shining shield from his shoulders and held it up like a mirror so that he saw the dreadful women reflected in it and did not see the terrible head itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he came nearer and nearer till he reckoned that he was within a swords stroke of the youngest and he guessed where he should strike a back blow behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he drew the sword of sharpness and struck once and the terrible head was cut from the shoulders of the creature and the blood leaped out and struck him like a blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he thrust the terrible head into his wallet and flew away without looking behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the two dreadful sisters who were left wakened and rose in the air like great birds and though they could not see him because of his cap of darkness they flew after him up the wind following by the scent through the clouds like hounds hunting in a wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came so close that he could hear the clatter of their golden wings and their shrieks to each other here here no there this way he went as they chased him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the shoes of swiftness flew too fast for them and at last their cries and the rattle of their wings died away as he crossed the great river that runs round the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now when the horrible creatures were far in the distance and the boy found himself on the right side of the river he flew straight eastward trying to seek his own country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as he looked down from the air he saw a very strange sighta beautiful girl chained to a stake at the highwater mark of the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl was so frightened or so tired that she was only prevented from falling by the iron chain about her waist and there she hung as if she were dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy was very sorry for her and flew down and stood beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he spoke she raised her head and looked round but his voice only seemed to frighten her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he remembered that he was wearing the cap of darkness and that she could only hear him not see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he took it off and there he stood before her the handsomest young man she had ever seen in all her life with short curly yellow hair and blue eyes and a laughing face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he thought her the most beautiful girl in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so first with one blow of the sword of sharpness he cut the iron chain that bound her and then he asked her what she did there and why men treated her so cruelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she told him that she was the daughter of the king of that country and that she was tied there to be eaten by a monstrous beast out of the sea for the beast came and devoured a girl every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the lot had fallen on her and as she was just saying this a long fierce head of a cruel sea creature rose out of the waves and snapped at the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the beast had been too greedy and too hurried so he missed his aim the first time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before he could rise and bite again the boy had whipped the terrible head out of his wallet and held it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the sea beast leaped out once more its eyes fell on the head and instantly it was turned into a stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the stone beast is there on the seacoast to this day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the boy and the girl went to the palace of the king her father where everyone was weeping for her death and they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw her come back well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the king and queen made much of the boy and could not contain themselves for delight when they found he wanted to marry their daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the two were married with the most splendid rejoicings and when they had passed some time at court they went home in a ship to the boys own country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he could not carry his bride through the air so he took the shoes of swiftness and the cap of darkness and the sword of sharpness up to a lonely place in the hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he left them and there they were found by the man and woman who had met him at home beside the sea and had when this had been done the boy and his bride set forth for home and landed at the harbor of his native land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but whom should he meet in the very street of the town but his own mother flying for her life from the wicked king who now wished to kill her because he found that she would never marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if she had liked the king ill before she liked him far worse now that he had caused her son to disappear so suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not know of course where the boy had gone but thought the king had slain him secretly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so now she was running for her very life and the wicked king was following her with a sword in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ran into her sons very arms but he had only time to kiss her and step in front of her when the king struck at him with his sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy caught the blow on his shield and cried i swore to bring you the terrible head and see how i keep my oath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he drew forth the head from his wallet and when the kings eyes fell on it instantly he was turned into stone just as he stood there with his sword lifted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now all the people rejoiced because the wicked king should rule them no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they asked the boy to be their king but he said no he must take his mother home to her fathers house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the people chose for king the man who had been kind to his mother when first she was cast on the island in the great chest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the boy and his mother and his wife set sail for his mothers own country from which she had been driven so unkindly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on the way they stayed at the court of a king and it happened that he was holding games and giving prizes to the best runners boxers and quoitthrowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the boy would try his strength with the rest but he threw the quoit so far that it went beyond what had ever been thrown before and fell in the crowd striking a man so that he died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this man was no other than the father of the boys mother who had fled away from his own kingdom for fear his grandson should find him and kill him after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus he was destroyed by his own cowardice and by chance and thus the prophecy was fulfilled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the boy and his wife and his mother went back to the kingdom that was theirs and lived long and happily after all their troubles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once upon a time there was a princess who was the prettiest creature in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and because she was so beautiful and because her hair was like the finest gold and waved and rippled nearly to the ground she was called pretty goldilocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she always wore a crown of flowers and her dresses were embroidered with diamonds and pearls and everybody who saw her fell in love with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now one of her neighbors was a young king who was not married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very rich and handsome and when he heard all that was said about pretty goldilocks though he had never seen her he fell so deeply in love with her that he could neither eat nor drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he resolved to send an ambassador to ask her in marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a splendid carriage made for his ambassador and gave him more than a hundred horses and a hundred servants and told him to be sure and bring the princess back with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after he had started nothing else was talked of at court and the king felt so sure that the princess would consent that he set his people to work at pretty dresses and splendid furniture that they might be ready by the time she came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile the ambassador arrived at the princesss palace and delivered his little message but whether she happened to be cross that day or whether the compliment did not please her is not known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she only answered that she was very much obliged to the king but she had no wish to be married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ambassador set off sadly on his homeward way bringing all the kings presents back with him for the princess was too well brought up to accept the pearls and diamonds when she would not accept the king so she had only kept twenty five english pins that he might not be vexed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the ambassador reached the city where the king was waiting impatiently everybody was very much annoyed with him for not bringing the princess and the king cried like a baby and nobody could console him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there was at the court a young man who was more clever and handsome than anyone else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was called charming and everyone loved him excepting a few envious people who were angry at his being the kings favorite and knowing all the state secrets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he happened to one day be with some people who were speaking of the ambassadors return and saying that his going to the princess had not done much good when charming said if the king had sent me to the princess goldilocks i am sure she would have come back with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will hardly believe sire what charming has the audacity to saythat if he had been sent to the princess goldilocks she would certainly have come back with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seems to think that he is so much handsomer than you that the princess would have fallen in love with him and followed him willingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king was very angry when he heard this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he does he laugh at my unhappiness and think himself more fascinating than i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go and let him be shut up in my great tower to die of hunger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the kings guards went to fetch charming who had thought no more of his rash speech and carried him off to prison with great cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor prisoner had only a little straw for his bed and but for a little stream of water which flowed through the tower he would have died of thirst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am his most faithful subject and have done nothing against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king chanced to be passing the tower and recognized the voice of his former favorite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped to listen in spite of charmings enemies who tried to persuade him to have nothing more to do with the traitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the be quiet i wish to hear what he says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he opened the tower door and called to charming who came very sadly and kissed the kings what have i done sire to deserve this cruel treatment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mocked me and my ambassador said the king and you said that if i had sent you for the princess goldilocks you would certainly have brought her back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is quite true sire replied charming i should have drawn such a picture of you and represented your good qualities in such a way that i am certain the princess would have found you irresistible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i cannot see what there is in that to make you angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king could not see any cause for anger either when the matter was presented to him in this light and he be gan to frown very fiercely at the courtiers who had so misrepresented his favorite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he took charming back to the palace with him and after seeing that he had a very good supper he said to you know that i love pretty goldilocks as much as ever her refusal has not made any difference to me but i dont know how to make her change her mind i really should like to send you to see if you can persuade her to marry me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charming replied that he was perfectly willing to go and would set out the very next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must wait till i can get a grand escort for you said the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but charming said that he only wanted a good horse to ride and the king who was delighted at his being ready to start so promptly gave him letters to the princess and bade him good speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on a monday morning that he set out all alone upon his errand thinking of nothing but how he could persuade the princess goldilocks to marry the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a writingbook in his pocket and whenever any happy thought struck him he dismounted from his horse and sat down under the trees to put it into the harangue which he was preparing for the princess before he forgot it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> try it now weve no time to lose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blix shifted in her seat and cleared her throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then what a pretty boat that is up there that picture on the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> condy tell me what kind of a boat is that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> condy turned about in his place with great deliberation fixed the picture with a judicial eye and announced decisively that?why thats a barkentine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> condy had no need to wait for blixs report <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the demonstration came far too quickly for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the redheaded man at his loud declaration merely glanced in the direction of the chromo and returned to his enchellados <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he of the black mustache followed condys glance noted the picture of which he spoke and snorted contemptuously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they even heard him mutter beneath his mustache barkentine your eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt as to which is the captain now whispered condy so soon as the other had removed from him a glance of withering scorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could hardly restrain their gayety but their gravity promptly returned when blix kicked condys foot under the table and murmured hes looking at his watch the captain is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isnt here yet and the redheaded man the coincidence is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he wont go till hes through his supper you can depend upon that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i had so counted upon bringing these two together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can see that with one hand tied behind you whispered condy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looks just like the kind of man to get into jail sooner or later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe hes into some mischief now you never can tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the mexican quarter of san francisco is just the place for affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well here he isthats the main pointjust keeping those people apart spoiling a whole romance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a positive crisis were looking at now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whispered blix all at once in a quiver of excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a way if wed ever have the courage to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might work and if it didnt hed never know the difference never would suspect us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may come in that door at any second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im half afraid but all the samecondy let me have a pencil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dashed off a couple of lines on the back of the bill of fare and her hand trembled like a leaf as she handed him what she had written <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres an office just two doors below here next the drugstore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know his initials remember you saw them in his hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord muttered condy as he gazed upon what blix had written <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can leave me here that length of time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quick condy decide one way or the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you won all of mine a few moments later he was back again and the two sat pretending to eat their chili peppers their hearts in their throats hardly daring to raise their eyes from their plates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> condy was actually sick with excitement and all but tipped the seltzer bottle to the floor when a messenger boy appeared in the outer room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy and the proprietor held a conference over the counter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then richard appeared between the portieres of nottingham lace the telegram in his hand and the boy at his heels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently richard knew the redheaded man for he crossed over to him at once with the words i guess this is for you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the redheaded man signed the receipt the boy departed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blix and condy heard the sound of torn paper as the redheaded man opened the telegram <end> <end> 
<start> <start> condy dared to steal a glance at the redheaded mans reflection in the mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i chuckled to myself as i ran through the documents i rubbed my hands i sang aloud in my glee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> day found me at the pleasing task nor did i then remit my diligence except in so far as i went to the window looked out for a moment to see the frost quite gone the world turned black again and the rain and the wind driving in the bay and to assure myself that the lugger was gone from its anchorage and the master whether dead or alive now tumbling on the irish sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is proper i should add in this place the very little i have subsequently angled out upon the doings of that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took me a long while to gather it for we dared not openly ask and the freetraders regarded me with enmity if not with scorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was near six months before we even knew for certain that the man survived and it was years before i learned from one of crails men turned publican on his illgotten gain some particulars which smack to me of truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems the traders found the master struggled on one elbow and now staring round him and now gazing at the candle or at his hand which was all bloodied like a man stupid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon their coming he would seem to have found his mind bade them carry him aboard and hold their tongues and on the captain asking how he had come in such a pickle replied with a burst of passionate swearing and incontinently fainted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they held some debate but they were momently looking for a wind they were highly paid to smuggle him to france and did not care to delay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides which he was well enough liked by these abominable wretches they supposed him under capital sentence knew not in what mischief he might have got his wound and judged it a piece of good nature to remove him out of the way of danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he was taken aboard recovered on the passage over and was set ashore a convalescent at the havre de grace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is truly notable he said not a word to anyone of the duel and not a trader knows to this day in what quarrel or by the hand of what adversary he fell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with any other man i should have set this down to natural decency with him to pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not bear to avow perhaps even to himself that he had been vanquished by one whom he had so much insulted whom he so cruelly despised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> summary of events during the masters second absence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the heavy sickness which declared itself next morning i can think with equanimity as of the last unmingled trouble that befell my master and even that was perhaps a mercy in disguise for what pains of the body could equal the miseries of his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry and i had the watching by the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my old lord called from time to time to take the news but would not usually pass the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once i remember when hope was nigh gone he stepped to the bedside looked awhile in his sons face and turned away with a gesture of the head and hand thrown up that remains upon my mind as something tragic such grief and such a scorn of sublunary things were there expressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry and i had the room to ourselves taking turns by night and bearing each other company by day for it was dreary watching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry his shaven head bound in a napkin tossed fro without remission beating the bed with his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tongue never lay his voice ran continuously like a river so that my heart was weary with the sound of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was notable and to me inexpressibly mortifying that he spoke all the while on matters of no import comings and goings horses which he was ever calling to have saddled thinking perhaps the poor soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he might ride away from his discomfort matters of the garden the salmon nets and what i particularly raged to hear continually of his affairs cyphering figures and holding disputation with the tenantry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never a word of his father or his wife nor of the master save only for a day or two when his mind dwelled entirely in the past and he supposed himself a boy again and upon some innocent childs play with his brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what made this the more affecting it appeared the master had then run some peril of his life for there was a cry oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which he came over and over with a great deal of passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i say was affecting both to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry and myself but the balance of my masters wanderings did him little justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed he had set out to justify his brothers calumnies as though he was bent to prove himself a man of a dry nature immersed in moneygetting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had i been there alone i would not have troubled my thumb but all the while as i listened i was estimating the effect on the mans wife and telling myself that he fell lower every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was the one person on the surface of the globe that comprehended him and i was bound there should be yet another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether he was to die there and his virtues perish or whether he should save his days and come back to that inheritance of sorrows his right memory i was bound he should be heartily lamented in the one case and unaffectedly welcomed in the other by the person he loved the most his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finding no occasion of free speech i bethought me at last of a kind of documentary disclosure and for some nights when i was off duty and should have been asleep i gave my time to the preparation of that which i may call my budget <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this i found to be the easiest portion of my task and that which remained namely the presentation to my lady almost more than i had fortitude to overtake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several days i went about with my papers under my arm spying for some juncture of talk to serve as introduction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not deny but that some offered only when they did my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth and i think i might have been carrying about my packet till this day had not a fortunate accident delivered me from all my hesitations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was at night when i was once more leaving the room the thing not yet done and myself in despair at my own cowardice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you carry about with you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these last days i see you always coming in and out with the same armful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i returned upon my steps without a word laid the papers before her on the table and left her to her reading <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of what that was i am now to give you some idea and the best will be to reproduce a letter of my own which came first in the budget and of which according to an excellent habitude i have preserved the scroll <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will show too the moderation of my part in these affairs a thing which some have called recklessly in question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i trust i would not step out of my place without occasion but i see how much evil has flowed in the past to all of your noble house from that unhappy and secretive fault of reticency and the papers on which i venture to call your attention are family papers and all highly worthy your acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i append a schedule with some necessary observations and am honoured madam your ladyships obliged obedient servant ephraim mackellar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scroll of ten letters from ephraim mackellar to the hon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by courtesy master of ballantrae during the latters residence in paris under dates follow the dates nota to be read in connection with b <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seven original letters from the said mr of ballantrae to the c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three original letters from the mr of ballantrae to the hon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under dates follow the dates nota given me by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry to answer copies of my answers a a and a of these productions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henrys communications of which i can find no scroll may be gathered from those of his unnatural brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a correspondence original and scroll extending over a period of three years till january of the current year between the said mr of ballantrae and under secretary of state twentyseven in all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weary as i was with watching and distress of mind it was impossible for me to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all night long i walked in my chamber revolving what should be the issue and sometimes repenting the temerity of my immixture in affairs so private and with the first peep of the morning i was at the sickroom door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry had thrown open the shutters and even the window for the temperature was mild <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked steadfastly before her where was nothing to see or only the blue of the morning creeping among woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answered aggie sweetly and she crossed to the door and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not yet alfred said aggie and she closed the door very softly lest alfred should hear her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never knew alfred could be so silly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> warned aggie and she glanced anxiously toward alfreds door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all if jimmy doesnt come soon he never will see it declared aggie and she started toward the window to look out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then there was a short quick ring of the bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two women glanced at each other with mingled hope and fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the collar of his long ulster pushed high and the brim of his derby hat pulled low jimmy jinks crept cautiously into the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he at length ceased to glance over his shoulder and came to a full stop aggie perceived a bit of white flannel hanging beneath the hem of his tightly buttoned coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jimmy stared at them as though stupefied then glanced uneasily over his shoulder to make sure that no one was pursuing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aggie unbuttoned his ulster seized a wee mite wrapped in a large shawl and clasped it to her bosom with a sigh of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she exclaimed then crossed quickly to the bassinette and deposited her charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime having thrown discretion to the wind zoie had hopped out of bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as usual her greeting to jimmy was in the nature of a reproach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes chimed in aggie who was now bending over the crib <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answered jimmy hotly if you two think you can do any better youre welcome to the job and with that he threw off his overcoat and sank sullenly on the couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed zoie and aggie simultaneously and they glanced nervously toward alfreds bedroom door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jimmy looked at them without comprehending why he should sh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets see it she said peeping into the bassinette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then with a little cry of disgust she again looked at jimmy reproachfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jimmys contempt for womans ingratitude was too deep for words and he only stared at her in injured silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his reflections were quickly upset when alfred called from the next room to inquire again about baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whispered jimmy beginning to realise the meaning of the womens mysterious behaviour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said aggie again to jimmy and zoie flew toward the bed almost vaulting over the footboard in her hurry to get beneath the covers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the present alfred did not disturb them further <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apparently he was still occupied with his shaving but just as jimmy was about to ask for particulars the phone rang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the three culprits glanced guiltily at each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jimmy paused in the act of sitting and turned his round eyes toward the phone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we cant she was saying thats impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called zoie across the foot of the bed unable longer to endure the suspense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how dare you call my husband a thief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jimmy was following the conversation with growing interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait a minute said aggie then she left the receiver hanging by the cord and turned to the expectant pair behind her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that awful woman says jimmy stole her baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed zoie as though such depravity on jimmys part were unthinkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she looked at him accusingly and asked in low measured tones did you steal her baby jimmy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> zoie looked at the unfortunate creature as if she could strangle him and aggie addressed him with a threat in her voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well the superintendent says youve got to bring it straight back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried wolfinthetemple scornfully he sleeps like a log and i propose that we tie his hands and feet before we start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this suggestion met with enthusiastic approval and all the boys laughed heartily at the idea of brumleknute waking up and finding himself tied with ropes like a calf that is carried to market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now comrades commanded the chief with a flourish of his sword get to bed quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill call you at four oclock well then start to chase the monarch of the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sons of the vikings scrambled into their bunks with great despatch and though their beds consisted of pine twigs covered with a coarse sheet and a bat of straw for a pillow they fell asleep without rocking and slept more soundly than if they had rested on silken bolsters filled with eiderdown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wolfinthetemple was as good as his word and waked them promptly at four oclock and their first task after having filled their knapsacks with provisions was to tie brumleknutes hands and feet with the most cunning slipknots which would tighten more the more he struggled to unloose them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ironbeard who had served a year before the mast was the contriver of this daring enterprise and he did it so cleverly that brumleknute never suspected that his liberty was being interfered with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he snorted a little and rubbed imaginary cobwebs from his face but soon lapsed again into a deep snoring unconsciousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the faces of the sons of the vikings grew very serious as they started out on this dangerous expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was more than one of them who would not have objected to remaining at home but who feared to incur the charge of cowardice if he opposed the wishes of the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wolfinthetemple walked at the head of the column as they hastened with stealthy tread out of the saeter inclosure and steered their course toward the dense pine forest the tops of which were visible toward the east where the mountain sloped toward the valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he carried his fowlingpiece loaded with shot in his right hand and a powderhorn and other equipments for the chase were flung across his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> erling the lopsided was similarly armed and ironbeard glorying in a real sword unsheathed it every minute and let it flash in the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a great consolation to the rest of the vikings to see these formidable weapons for they were not wise enough to know that grownup bears are not killed with shot and that a fowlingpiece is a good deal more dangerous than no weapon at all in the hands of an inexperienced hunter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun who had exchanged his flaming robe de nuit for the rosy colors of morning was now shooting his bright shafts of light across the mountain plain and cheering the hearts of the sons of the vikings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air was fresh and cool and it seemed a luxury to breathe it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it entered the lungs in a pure vivifying stream like an elixir of life and sent the blood dancing through the veins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was impossible to mope in such air and ironbeard we wander with joy on the far mountain path we follow the star that will guide us but before he had finished the third verse it occurred to the chief that they were bearhunters and that it was very unsportsmanlike behavior to sing on the chase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all that they were all very jolly throbbing with excitement at the thought of the adventures which they were about to encounter and concealing a latent spark of fear under an excess of bravado <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of an hours march they had reached the pine forest and as they were all ravenously hungry they sat down upon the stones where a clear mountain brook ran down the slope and unpacked their provisions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wolfinthetemple had just helped himself in old norse fashion to a slice of smoked ham having slashed a piece off at random with his knife when erling the lopsided observed that that ham had a very curious odor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everyone had to test its smell and they all agreed that it did have a singular flavor though its taste was irreproachable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it smells like a menagerie said the skullsplitter as he handed it to thore the hound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the bread and the biscuit smell just the same said thore the hound in fact it is the air that smells like a menagerie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boys cried wolfinthetemple do you see that track in the mud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes it is the track of a barefooted man suggested the innocent skullsplitter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ironbeard and erling the lopsided flung themselves down among the stones and investigated the tracks and they were no longer in doubt as to where the pungent wild odor came from which they had attributed to the ham <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boys said erling looking up with an excited face a shebear with one or two cubs has been here within a few minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is her drinkingplace said ironbeard the tracks are many and wellworn if she hasnt been here this morning she is sure to come before long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are in luck indeed wolfinthetemple observed coolly we neednt go far for our bear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that moment the note of an alpine horn was heard but it was impossible to determine how far it was away for the echo took up the note and flung it back and forth with clear and strong reverberations from mountain to mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is brumleknute who is calling us said thore the hound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never cried the chief proudly i forbid you to answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we have our heroic deed in sight and i want no one to spoil it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there is a coward among us let him take to his heels no one shall detain him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were perhaps several who would have liked to accept the invitation but no one did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the belted lords of britain her ancient peers must decide if it is their will that a house not the least noble of their members shall be stripped of their possessions the reward of the patriotism of generations as the pawn of a wretched mechanic becomes forfeit to the usurer the instant the hour of redemption has passed away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they yield to the grasping severity of the creditor and to the gnawing usury that eats into our lands as moths into a raiment it will be of more evil consequence to them and their posterity than to edgar ravenswood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall still have my sword and my cloak and can follow the profession of arms wherever a trumpet shall sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he pronounced these words in a firm yet melancholy tone he raised his eyes and suddenly encountered those of lucy ashton who had stolen unawares on their interview and observed her looks fastened on them with an expression of enthusiastic interest and admiration which had wrapt her for the moment beyond the fear of discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noble form and fine features of ravenswood fired with the pride of birth and sense of internal dignity the mellow and expressive tones of his voice the desolate state of his fortunes and the indifference with which he seemed to endure and to dare the worst that might befall rendered him a dangerous object of contemplation for a maiden already too much disposed to dwell upon recollections connected with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when their eyes encountered each other both blushed deeply conscious of some strong internal emotion an shunned again to meet each others looks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir william ashton had of course closely watched the expression of their countenances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i need fear said he internally neither parliament nor protestation i have an effectual mode of reconciling myself with this hottempered young fellow in case he shall become formidable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the present object is at all events to avoid committing ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hook is fixed we will nto strain the line too soon it is as well to reserve the privilege of slipping it loose if we do not find the fish worth landing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this selfish and cruel calculation upon the supposed attachment of ravenswood to lucy he was so far from considering the pain he might give to the former by thus dallying with his affections that he even did not think upon the risk of involving his own daughter in the perils of an unfortunate passion as if her predilection which could not escape his attention were like the flame of a taper which might be lighted or extinguished at pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but providence had prepared a dreadful requital for this keen observer of human passions who had spent his life in securing advantages to himself by artfully working upon the passions of others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caleb balderstone now came to announce that breakfast was prepared for in those days of substantial feeding the relics of the supper simply furnished forth the morning meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither did he forget to present to the lord keeper with great reverence a morning draught in a large pewter cup garnished with leaves of parsley and scurvygrass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he craved pardon of course for having omitted to serve it in the great silver standing cup as behoved being that it was at present in a silversmiths in edinburgh for the purpose of being overlaid with gilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in edinburgh like enough said ravenswood but in what place or for what purpose i am afraid neither you nor i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said caleb peevishly theres a man standing at the gate already this morningthats ae thing that i ken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does your honour ken whether ye will speak wi him or no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does he wish to speak with me caleb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> less will no serve him said caleb but ye had best take a visie of him through the wicket before opening the gate its no every ane we suld let into this castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you suppose him to be a messenger come to arrest me for debt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a messenger arrest your honour for debt and in your castle of wolfs crag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your honour is jesting wi auld caleb this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however he whispered in his ear as he followed him out i would be loth to do ony decent man a prejudice in your honours gude opinion but i would tak twa looks o that chield before i let him within these walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not an officer of the law however being no less a person than captain craigengelt with his nose as red as a comfortable cup of brandy could make it his laced cocked hat set a little aside upon the top of his black riding periwig a sword by his side and pistols at his holsters and his person arrayed in a riding suit laid over with tarnished lacethe very moral of one who would say stand to a true man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the master had recognised him he ordered the gates to be opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose he said captain craigengelt there are no such weighty matters betwixt you and me but may be discussed in this place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have company in the castle at present and the terms upon which we last parted must excuse my asking you to make part of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> craigengelt although possessing the very perfection of impudence was somewhat abashed by this unfavourable reception <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had no intention he said to force himself upon the master of ravenswoods hospitality he was in the honourable service of bearing a message to him from a friend otherwise the master of ravenswood should not have had reason to complain of this intrusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let it be short sir said the master for that will be the best apology <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who is the gentleman who is so fortunate as to have your services as a messenger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hayston of bucklaw answered craigengelt with conscious importance and that confidence which the acknowledged courage of his principal inspired who conceives himself to have been treated by you with something much short of the respect which he had reason to demand and therefore is resolved to exact satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bring with me said he taking a piece of paper out of his pocket the precise length of his sword and he requests you will meet him accompanied by a friend and equally armed at any place within a mile of the castle when i shall give attendance as umpire or second on his behoof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeated ravenswood who the reader will recollect had no reason to suppose he had given the slightest offence to his late intimate upon my word captain craigengelt either you have invented the most improbable falsehood that ever came into the mind of such a person or your morning draught has been somewhat of the strongest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what could persuade bucklaw to send me such a message <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for that sir replied craigengelt i am desired to refer you to what in duty to my friend i am to term your inhospitality in excluding him from your house without reasons assigned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is impossible replied the master he cannot be such a fool as to interpret actual necessity as an insult <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor do i believe that knowing my opinion of you captain he would have employed the services of so slight and inconsiderable a person as yourself upon such an errand as i certainly could expect no man of honour to act with you in the office of umpire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said craigengelt raising his voice and laying his hand on his cutlass if it were not that the quarrel of my friend craves the precedence and is in dependence before my own i would give you to understand i can understand nothing upon your explanation captain craigengelt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be satisfied of that and oblige me with your departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> muttered the bully and is this the answer which i am to carry back to an honourable message <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell the laird of bucklaw answered ravenswood if you are really sent by him that when he sends me his cause of grievance by a person fitting to carry such an errand betwixt him and me i will either explain it or maintain it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then master you will at least cause to be returned to hayston by my hands his property which is remaining in your possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever property bucklaw may have left behind him sir replied the master shall be returned to him by my servant as you do not show me any credentials from him which entitle you to receive it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well master said captain craigengelt with malice which even his fear of the consequences could not suppress you have this morning done me an egregious wrong adn dishonour but far more to yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he continued looking around him why this is worse than a coupegorge house where they receive travellers to plunder them of their property <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you insolent rascal said the master raising his cane and making a grasp at the captains bridle if you do not depart without uttering another syllable i will batoon you to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the motion of the master towards him the bully turned so rapidly round that with some difficulty he escaped throwing down his horse whose hoofs struck fire from the rocky pavement in every direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> recovering him however with the bridle he pushed for the gate and rode sharply back again in the direction of the village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as ravenswood turned round to leave the courtyard after this dialogue he found that the lord keeper had descended from the hall and witnessed though at the distance prescribed by politeness his interview with craigengelt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen said the lord keeper that gentlemans face and at no great distance of time his name is craigcraig something is it not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> craigengelt is the fellows name said the master at least that by which he passes at present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> craiginguilt said caleb punning upon the word craig which in scotch signifies throat if he is craiginguilt just now he is as likely to be craiginperil as ony chield i ever saw the loon has woodie written on his very visnomy and i wad wager twa and a plack that hemp plaits his cravat yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caleb said the keeper smiling i assure you the gentleman has been near such a consummation before now for i most distinctly recollect that upon occasion of a journey which i made about a fortnight ago to edinburgh i saw mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> craigengelt or whatever is his name undergo a severe examination before the privy council <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the master of ravenswood with some interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the question led immediately to a tale which the lord keeper had been very anxious to introduce when he could find a graceful and fitting opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took hold of the masters arm and led him back towards the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answer to your question he said though it is a ridiculous business is only fit for your own ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they entered the hall he again took the master apart into one of the recesses of the window where it will be easily believed that miss ashton did not venture again to intrude upon their conference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is a father now will truck his daughter for a foreign venture make her the stopgap to some cankerd feud or fling her oer like jonah to the fishes to appease the sea at highest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lord keeper opened his discourse with an appearance of unconcern marking however very carefully the effect of his communication upon young ravenswood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are aware he said my young friend that suspicion is the natural vice of our unsettled times and exposes the best and wisest of us to the imposition of artful rascals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had been disposed to listen to such the other day or even if i had been the wily politicians which you have been taught to believe me you master of ravenswood instead of being at freedom and with fully liberty to solicit and act against me as you please in defence of what you suppose to be your rights would have been in the castle of edinburgh or some other state prison or if you had escaped that destiny it must have been by flight to a foreign country and at the risk of a sentence of fugitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lord keeper said the master i think you would not jest on such a subject yet it seems impossible you can be in earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> innocence said the lord keeper is also confident and sometimes though very excusably presumptuously so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you wouldnt hardly call it that seeing that shes been sick with typhoid for seven weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while im not in the habit of asking gentlemen their names id like to inquire if yours happens to be marksgabe i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss bauers nurse telephones down last week that if a gentleman named marksgabe i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marksdrops in and inquires for miss bauer im to tell him that shes changed her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the way from spiegels corset department to the car gabe stopped only for a bunch of violets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effies apartment house reached he sent up his card the violets and a message that the gentleman was waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came back a reply that sent gabie up before the violets were relieved of their first layer of tissue paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie was sitting in a deep chair by the window a flowered quilt bunched about her shoulders her feet in gray knitted bedroom slippers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked every minute of her age and she knew it and didnt care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hand that she held out to gabe was a limp white fleshless thing that seemed to bear no relation to the plump firm member that gabe had pressed on so many previous occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabe stared at this pale wraith in a moment of alarm and youre lookinggreat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guess youve just been stalling for a beauty rest what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie smiled a tired little smile and shook her head slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre a good kid gabie to lie like that just to make me feel good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my nurse left yesterday and i had my first real squint at myself in the mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wouldnt let me look while she was here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after what i saw staring back at me from that glass a whole ballroom full of french courtiers whispering sweet nothings in my ear couldnt make me believe that i look like anything but a hunk of roquefort green spots included <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i think of how my clothes wont fit it makes me shiver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh youll soon be back at the store as good as new <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i had a friend did you get my message <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was only talking to hide my nervousness said gabe and started forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked thoughtfully down at one shining finger nail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her lower lip was caught between her teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she looked up again her eyes were swimming in tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this fever leaves you as weak as a rag and ready to cry if any one says boo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been doing some highpressure thinking since nursie left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had plenty of time to do it in sitting here by this window all day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never knew there was so much time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres been days when i havent talked to a soul except the nurse and the chambermaid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say the amount of petting i could stand would surprise you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course my nurse was a perfectly good nurseat twentyfive per <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was just a case to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant expect a nurse to ooze sympathy over an old maid with the fever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you i was dying to have some one say shshsh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when there was a noise just to show they were interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever id moan the nurse would come over and stick a thermometer in my mouth and write something down on a chart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys and girls at the store sent flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd have done the same if id died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the fever broke i just used to lie there and dream not feeling anything in particular and not caring much whether it was day or night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to think i was pretty smart earning my own good living dressing as well as the next one and able to spend my vacation in atlantic city if i wanted to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while i was sick i got to wishing that there was somebody that belonged to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody to worry about me and to sit up nightssomebody that just naturally felt they had to come tiptoeing into my room every three or four minutes to see if i was sleeping or had enough covers on or wanted a drink or something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got to thinking what it would have been like if i had a husband and ahome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabie took effies limp white hand in his and stroked it gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was pained by the perfunctory phrase with which evelina urged her to accompany them and still more by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i guess i wont go she repeated rather in answer to herself than to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its dreadfully hot and ive got a kinder headache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well i wouldnt then said her sister hurriedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd better jest set here quietly and rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a summary of part i of bunner sisters appears on page of the advertising pages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ramy returned and a moment later he and evelina left the shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evelina had made herself another new bonnet for the occasion a bonnet ann eliza thought almost too youthful in shape and colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time it had ever occurred to her to criticize evelinas taste and she was frightened at the insidious change in her attitude toward her sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when ann eliza in later days looked back on that afternoon she felt that there had been something prophetic in the quality of its solitude it seemed to distill the triple essence of loneliness in which all her afterlife was to be lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no purchasers came not a hand fell on the doorlatch and the tick of the clock in the back room ironically emphasized the passing of the empty hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ann eliza felt the coming crisis in the sound of her footstep which wavered along as if not knowing on what it trod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elder sisters affection had so passionately projected itself into her juniors fate that at such moments she seemed to be living two lives her own and evelinas and her private longings shrank into silence at the sight of the others hungry bliss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was evident that evelina never acutely alive to the emotional atmosphere about her had no idea that her secret was suspected and with an assumption of unconcern that would have made ann eliza smile if the pang had been less piercing the younger sister prepared to confess herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said impatiently as ann eliza beneath the gasjet fumbled for the matches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aint you even got time to ask me if id had a pleasant day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seems to me its pretty plain you have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how i feel its all so queer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it all happened so suddenly and the boat was so crowded i thought everybodyd hear what he was saying.ann eliza she broke out why on earth dont you ask me what im talking about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ann eliza with a last effort of heroism feigned a fond incomprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it happened right on the boat only to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not the deadtiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort from which recovery is a matter of hours but it was the deadtiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no power of recuperation left no reserve strength to call upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been all used the last least bit of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every muscle every fibre every cell was tired dead tired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in less than five months they had travelled twentyfive hundred miles during the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they arrived at skaguay they were apparently on their last legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could barely keep the traces taut and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the way of the sled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mush on poor sore feets the driver encouraged them as they tottered down the main street of skaguay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> themselves they had covered twelve hundred miles with two days rest and in the nature of reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but so many were the men who had rushed into the klondike and so many were the sweethearts wives and kin that had not rushed in that the congested mail was taking on alpine proportions also there were official orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fresh batches of hudson bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the worthless ones were to be got rid of and since dogs count for little against dollars they were to be sold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three days passed by which time buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then on the morning of the fourth day two men from the states came along and bought them harness and all for a song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men addressed each other as hal and charles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charles was a middleaged lightishcolored man with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty with a big colts revolver and a huntingknife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this belt was the most salient thing about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it advertised his callownessa callowness sheer and unutterable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both men were manifestly out of place and why such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buck heard the chaffering saw the money pass between the man and the government agent and knew that the scotch halfbreed and the mailtrain drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and francois and the others who had gone before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when driven with his mates to the new owners camp buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair tent half stretched dishes unwashed everything in disorder also he saw a woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was charless wife and hals sistera nice family party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a great deal of effort about their manner but no businesslike method <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> spirit said scrooge submissively conduct me where you will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went forth last night on compulsion and i learnt a lesson which is working now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tonight if you have aught scrooge did as he was told and held it fast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holly mistletoe red berries ivy turkeys geese game poultry brawn meat pigs sausages oysters pies puddings fruit and punch all vanished instantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so did the room the fire the ruddy glow the hour of night and they stood in the city streets on christmas morning where for the weather was severe the people made a rough but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings and from the tops of their houses whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below and splitting into artificial little snowstorms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house fronts looked black enough and the windows blacker contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs and with the dirtier snow upon the ground which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons furrows that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off and made intricate channels hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sky was gloomy and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist half thawed half frozen whose heavier particles descended in shower of sooty atoms as if all the chimneys in great britain had by one consent caught fire and were blazing away to their dear hearts content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee calling out to one another from the parapets and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball betternatured missile far than many a wordy jest laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poulterers shops were still half open and the fruiterers were radiant in their glory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were great round potbellied baskets of chestnuts shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were ruddy brownfaced broadgirthed spanish friars and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by and glanced demurely at the hungup mistletoe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids there were bunches of grapes made in the shopkeepers benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks that peoples mouths might water gratis as they passed there were piles of filberts mossy and brown recalling in their fragrance ancient walks among the woods and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves there were norfolk biffins squab and swarthy setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons and in the great compactness of their juicy persons urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got his place here with the if mr <end> <end>

<start> <start> i am his sole heir but he persists in holding on to his money bags and limits me to a paltry three thousand a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must see if i cant induce him to give me a good round sum on accountfifty thousand at leastand then i can wait a little more patiently when shall we reach port captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so this is my birthday he said to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half my life gone and i am still a dependent on my uncles bounty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose he should throw me offleave me out in the coldwhere should i be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he should find the boybut no there is no chance of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the way i must look him up sooncautiously of courseand see what has become of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will grow up a laborer or mechanic and die without a knowledge of his birth at six oclock the vessel reached the quarantine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the passengers decided to remain on board one night more but john wade was impatient and leaving his trunks obtained a small boat and soon touched the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was nearly eight when john wade landed in the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was halfpast eight when he stood on the steps of his uncles residence and rang the bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked of the servant who answered the bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am his nephew just arrived from europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel as if i were enchanted or bewitched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is barely eight oclock yet it is nothing like halfpast when i have had my luggage examined at that briskest of customhouses attached to the station and am rattling over the pavement in a hackneycabriolet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know any other place where there are all these high houses all these haggardlooking wine shops all these billiard tables all these stockingmakers with flat red or yellow legs of wood for signboard all these fuel shops with stacks of billets painted outside and real billets sawing in the gutter all these dirty corners of streets all these cabinet pictures over dark doorways representing discreet matrons nursing babies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet this morning ill think of it in a warmbath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very like a small room that i remember in the chinese baths upon the boulevard certainly and though i see it through the steam i think that i might swear to that peculiar hotlinen basket like a large wicker hourglass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when can it have been that i left home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when was it that i paid through to paris at london bridge and discharged myself of all responsibility except the preservation of a voucher ruled into three divisions of which the first was snipped off at folkestone the second aboard the boat and the third taken at my journeys end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowds in the streets the lights in the shops and balconies the elegance variety and beauty of their decorations the number of the theatres the brilliant cafes with their windows thrown up high and their vivacious groups at little tables on the pavement the light and glitter of the houses turned as it were inside out soon convince me that it is no dream that i am in paris howsoever i got there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stroll down to the sparkling palais royal up the rue de rivoli to the place vendome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i glance into a printshop window monied interest my late travelling companion comes upon me laughing with the highest relish of disdain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says pointing to napoleon in the window and napoleon on the column <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a statue when i came away at hyde park corner and another in the city and a print or two in the shops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walk up to the barriere de letoile sufficiently dazed by my flight to have a pleasant doubt of the reality of everything about me of the lively crowd the overhanging trees the performing dogs the hobbyhorses the beautiful perspectives of shining lamps the hundred and one enclosures where the singing is in gleaming orchestras of azure and gold and where a stareyed houri comes round with a box for voluntary offerings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i pass to my hotel enchanted sup enchanted go to bed enchanted pushing back this morning if it really were this morning into the remoteness of time blessing the southeastern company for realising the arabian nights in these prose days murmuring as i wing my idle flight into the land of dreams no hurry ladies and gentlemen going to paris in eleven hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is so well done we are not by any means devout believers in the old bow street police <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to say the truth we think there was a vast amount of humbug about those worthies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apart from many of them being men of very indifferent character and far too much in the habit of consorting with thieves and the like they never lost a public occasion of jobbing and trading in mystery and making the most of themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> continually puffed besides by incompetent magistrates anxious to conceal their own deficiencies and handinglove with the pennyaliners of that time they became a sort of superstition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although as a preventive police they were utterly ineffective and as a detective police were very loose and uncertain in their operations they remain with some people a superstition to the present day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the other hand the detective force organised since the establishment of the existing police is so well chosen and trained proceeds so systematically and quietly does its business in such a workmanlike manner and is always so calmly and steadily engaged in the service of the public that the public really do not know enough of it to know a tithe of its usefulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> impressed with this conviction and interested in the men themselves we represented to the authorities at scotland yard that we should be glad if there were no official objection to have some talk with the detectives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a most obliging and ready permission being given a certain evening was appointed with a certain inspector for a social conference between ourselves and the detectives at the household words office in wellington street strand london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in consequence of which appointment the party came off which we are about to describe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we beg to repeat that avoiding such topics as it might for obvious reasons be injurious to the public or disagreeable to respectable individuals to touch upon in print our description is as exact as we can make it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reader will have the goodness to imagine the sanctum sanctorum of household words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything that best suits the readers fancy will best represent that magnificent chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we merely stipulate for a round table in the middle with some glasses and cigars arranged upon it and the editorial sofa elegantly hemmed in between that stately piece of furniture and the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stones of wellington street are hot and gritty and the watermen and hackneycoachmen at the theatre opposite are much flushed and aggravated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carriages are constantly setting down the people who have come to fairyland and there is a mighty shouting and bellowing every now and then deafening us for the moment through the open windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just at dusk inspectors wield and stalker are announced but we do not undertake to warrant the orthography of any of the names here mentioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inspector wield is a middleaged man of a portly presence with a large moist knowing eye a husky voice and a habit of emphasising his conversation by the aid of a corpulent forefinger which is constantly in juxtaposition with his eyes or nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inspector stalker is a shrewd hardheaded scotchman in appearance not at all unlike a very acute thoroughlytrained schoolmaster from the normal establishment at glasgow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inspector wield one might have known perhaps for what he is inspector stalker never <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ceremonies of reception over inspectors wield and stalker observe that they have brought some sergeants with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sergeants are presented five in number sergeant dornton sergeant witchem sergeant mith sergeant fendall and sergeant straw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have the whole detective force from scotland yard with one exception <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sit down in a semicircle the two inspectors at the two ends at a little distance from the round table facing the editorial sofa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every man of them in a glance immediately takes an inventory of the furniture and an accurate sketch of the editorial presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the editor feels that any gentleman in company could take him up if need should be without the smallest hesitation twenty years hence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sergeant dornton about fifty years of age with a ruddy face and a high sunburnt forehead has the air of one who has been a sergeant in the army he might have sat to wilkie for the soldier in the reading of the will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is famous for steadily pursuing the inductive process and from small beginnings working on from clue to clue until he bags his man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sergeant witchem shorter and thickerset and marked with the smallpox has something of a reserved and thoughtful air as if he were engaged in deep arithmetical calculations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is renowned for his acquaintance with the swell mob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sergeant mith a smoothfaced man with a fresh bright complexion and a strange air of simplicity is a dab at housebreakers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sergeant fendall a light haired wellspoken polite person is a prodigious hand at pursuing private inquiries of a delicate nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straw a little wiry sergeant of meek demeanour and strong sense would knock at a door and ask a series of questions in any mild character you choose to prescribe to him from a charityboy upwards and seem as innocent as an infant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are one and all respectablelooking men of perfectly good deportment and unusual intelligence with nothing lounging or slinking in their manners with an air of keen observation and quick perception when addressed and generally presenting in their faces traces more or less marked of habitually leading lives of strong mental excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have all good eyes and they all can and they all do look full at whomsoever they speak to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we light the cigars and hand round the glasses which are very temperately used indeed and the conversation begins by a modest amateur reference on the editorial part to the swell mob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inspector wield immediately removes his cigar from his lips waves his right hand and says regarding the swell mob sir i cant do better than call upon sergeant witchem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now the hunt was up priest and soldier were in full cry for my conversion and the work of the propagation of the faith for which the people of cheylard subscribed fortyeight francs ten centimes during was being gallantly pursued against myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an odd but most effective proselytising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they never sought to convince me in argument where i might have attempted some defence but took it for granted that i was both ashamed and terrified at my position and urged me solely on the point of time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now they said when god had led me to our lady of the snows now was the appointed hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not be withheld by false shame observed the priest for my encouragement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for one who feels very similarly to all sects of religion and who has never been able even for a moment to weigh seriously the merit of this or that creed on the eternal side of things however much he may see to praise or blame upon the secular and temporal side the situation thus created was both unfair and painful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i committed my second fault in tact and tried to plead that it was all the same thing in the end and we were all drawing near by different sides to the same kind and undiscriminating friend and father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that as it seems to lay spirits would be the only gospel worthy of the name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but different men think differently and this revolutionary aspiration brought down the priest with all the terrors of the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the damned he said on the authority of a little book which he had read not a week before and which to add conviction to conviction he had fully intended to bring along with him in his pocket were to occupy the same attitude through all eternity in the midst of dismal tortures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as he thus expatiated he grew in nobility of aspect with his enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a result the pair concluded that i should seek out the prior since the abbot was from home and lay my case immediately before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cest mon conseil comme ancien militaire observed the oui added the cure sententiously nodding comme ancien at this moment whilst i was somewhat embarrassed how to answer in came one of the monks a little brown fellow as lively as a grig and with an italian accent who threw himself at once into the contention but in a milder and more persuasive vein as befitted one of these pleasant brethren <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rule was very hard he would have dearly liked to stay in his own country italy it was well known how beautiful it was the beautiful italy but then there were no trappists in italy and he had a soul to save and here he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid i must be at bottom what a cheerful indian critic has dubbed me a faddling hedonist for this description of the brothers motives gave me somewhat of a shock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have preferred to think he had chosen the life for its own sake and not for ulterior purposes and this shows how profoundly i was out of sympathy with these good trappists even when i was doing my best to sympathise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to the cure the argument seemed decisive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i have seen a marquis here a marquis a marquis he repeated the holy word three times over and other persons high in society and generals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> christopher held his peace and the earl spake again now is the shortest word best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we deem thee both goodly and doughty and would wed thee to a great lady even that one to whom thou hast shown kindness in the wilderness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said christopher it is the wont of great lords to mock poor folk therefore i must not show anger against thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mock thee not said the earl i mean nought but as my words say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay then said christopher thou biddest me an evil deed great lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i said was that i would compel no woman and shall i compel her who is the wonder of the world and my very own lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hold thy peace sir fool said the earl let me tell thee that she is as like to compel thee as thou her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as to her being thy lady she shall be thy lady and wife indeed but not here for above all things will she get her away from greenharbour and thou shalt be her champion to lead her about the world like a knight errant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now was christopher so troubled that he knew not what countenance to make and scarce might he get a word out of his mouth a long while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he said lord i see that i must needs do thy will if this be no trap which thou hast set for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but overwonderful it is that a great lady should be wedded to a gangrel churl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl laughed many a ferly fares to the faireyed quoth he and also i will tell thee in thine ear that this lady may not be so great as her name is great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay said christopher i mind me well she called herself the poor captive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said but sooth quoth the earl and her going away from greenharbour is instead of her captivity and i tell thee it is by that only i may make her joyous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now one word thou that criest out for the tofts in battle art not altogether unfriended meseemeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> christopher looked up proudly and fiercely he said forsooth lord my friends are good though thou callest them wolfheads and gallowsmeat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> champion said the earl laughing that may well be sooth and there are a many ups and downs in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bethink thee that the time may come when thou and thy friends may wend to my help and may win the names of knight and baron and earl such hap hath been aforetime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now i crave of thee when thou comest back to the tofts to bid jack fall upon other lands than meadham when he rideth because of the gift and wedding that i give thee now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so lad i deem that thou hast chosen thy part but let not the tale thereof go out of thy mouth or thou wilt gab away thy wedding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lo thou i leave this door open behind me and presently shall the smith come here to do away thine irons and i shall send a squire to thee to lead thee to a fair chamber and to bring thee goodly raiment and do thou play amongst thy fellows as one of the best of them and show them if thou wilt some such feats in peace as yesterday thou showedst them in battle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no worse than his word he was and anon came the smith and the squire and he was brought to a chamber and raiment of fine linen and silk and embroidery was brought to him and when he was new clad he looked like a kings son whereas aforetime he looked like a god of the gentiles of old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all men praised his beauty and his courtesy and after dinner was and they had rested they bade him play with them and show them his prowess and he was nought loth thereto and did what he might in running and leaping and casting of the bar and shooting in the bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in all these things he was so far before everyone that they marvelled at him and said it was well indeed that he had not been slain yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to wrestling therein he might do but little for all forbore him after the first man had stood before him a squire well learned in war and long and tough and deemed a very stark man him christopher threw over his shoulder as though he had been a child of twelve years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so wore the day at greenharbour in merrier wise for all good folk than for many a day had been the wont there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early on the morrow came the earl unto goldilind and she received him gladly as one who had fashioned life anew for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay after a short but brilliant engagement wycherley returned mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> minifie was very harmlessly perforated and in consequence i look to be married on thursday after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me die but cupid never meets with anything save inhospitality in this gross world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the boy is heels over head in love with aramintaoh a second almanzor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and my niece does not precisely hate him either let me tell you william for all your months assault of essences and perfumed gloves and apricot paste and other small artillery of courtship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> la my dear was it only a month ago we settled your future over a couple of naples biscuit and a bottle of rhenish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she walked beside him now and the progress of these exquisites was leisurely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were many trees at hand so huge as to necessitate a considerable detour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ley retorted since you suggested your respected brotherinlaw was ready to pay my debts in full upon condition i retaliated by making your adorable niece mistress wycherley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i stand today indebted to him for an advance of l and am no more afraid of bailiffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have performed a very creditable stroke of business and the day after tomorrow you will have fairly earned your l for arranging the marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith and in earnest of this i already begin to view you through appropriate lenses as undoubtedly the most desirable aunt in the universe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor was there any unconscionable stretching of the phrase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the quiet forest untouched as yet by any fidgeting culture and much as it was when john lackland wooed hawisa under its venerable oaks old even then the little widow moved like a light flame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was clothed throughout in scarlet after her high hearted style of dress and carried a tall staff of ebony and the gold head of it was farther from the dead leaves than was her mischievous countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she pleased the eye at least did this heartless merry and selfish olivia whom wycherley had so ruthlessly depicted in his plain dealer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the last detail wycherley found her as he phrased it mignonne et piquante and he told her so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lady drogheda continued yes i am a fool of course but then i still remember bessington and the boy that went mad there because of a surfeit of those dreams such as the poets know when they are young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sweet chuck beat not the bones of the buried when he breathed he was a likely lad mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well in any event you were the first gentleman in england to wear a neckcloth of flanders lace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you were the first person of quality to eat cheesecakes in spring garden he not half so mirth fully retorted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we have not entirely failed in life it may be after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made of him a quite irrelevant demand dye fancy esau was contented william <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fancy he was fond of pottage madam and that as i remember he got his pottage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come now a tangible bowl of pottage piping hot is not to be despised in such a hazardous world as ours is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord lord how musty all that brave sweet nonsense seems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> le vin est tire et il faut le boire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us put it a thought less dumpishly and render thanks because our pottage smokes upon the table and we are blessed with ex cellent appetites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that in a month we will be back again in the playhouses and hyde park and mulberry garden or nodding to each other in the new exchangeyou with your debts paid and i with my l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord remon came this afternoon said lady drogheda and with averted eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not approve of remon he announced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay madam even a siren ought to spare her kin and show some mercy toward the more stagnantblooded fish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is very wealthy and i am lamentably poor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one must not seek noon at fourteen oclock or clamor for better bread than was ever made from wheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by heavens madam you are in the right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i shall walk no more in figgis wood for its old magic breeds too many daydreams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now then let us discuss theology dear aunt or millinery or metaphysics or the kings new statue at windsor or if you will the last spring garden scandal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or let us count the leaves upon this tree and afterward i will enumerate my reasons for believing yonder crescent moon to be the paring of the angel gabriels left thumbnail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a woman of eloquent silences when there was any need of them and thus the fop and the coquette traversed the remainder of that solemn wood without any further speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> modish people would have esteemed them unwontedly glum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wycherley discovered in a while the absence of his sleevelinks and was properly vexed by the loss of these not unhandsome trinkets the gifts of lady castlemaine in the old days when mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wycherley was the kings successful rival for her favors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but wycherley knew the tide filled teviot bay and wondering fishes were at liberty to muzzle the toys by this and merely shrugged at his mishap midcourse in toilet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wycherley upon mature deliberation wore the green suit with yellow ribbons since there was a ball that night in honor of his nearing marriage and a confluence of gentry to attend it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how did our poor charlotte pass her time during a tedious and tempestuous passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally delicate the fatigue and sickness which she endured rendered her so weak as to be almost entirely confined to her bed yet the kindness and attention of montraville in some measure contributed to alleviate her sufferings and the hope of hearing from her friends soon after her arrival kept up her spirits and cheered many a gloomy hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but during the voyage a great revolution took place not only in the fortune of la rue but in the bosom of belcour whilst in pursuit of his amour with mademoiselle he had attended little to the interesting inobtrusive charms of charlotte but when cloyed by possession and disgusted with the art and dissimulation of one he beheld the simplicity and gentleness of the other the contrast became too striking not to fill him at once with surprise and admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he frequently conversed with charlotte he found her sensible well informed but diffident and unassuming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the languor which the fatigue of her body and perturbation of her mind spread over her delicate features served only in his opinion to render her more lovely he knew that montraville did not design to marry her and he formed a resolution to endeavour to gain her himself whenever montraville should leave her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let not the reader imagine belcours designs were honourable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when once a woman has forgot the respect due to herself by yielding to the solicitations of illicit love they lose all their consequence even in the eyes of the man whose art has betrayed them and for whose sake they have sacrificed every valuable consideration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay every libertine will think he has a right to insult her with his licentious passion and should the unhappy creature shrink from the insolent overture he will sneeringly taunt her with pretence of modesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the day before their arrival at newyork after dinner crayton arose from his seat and placing himself by mademoiselle as we are now nearly arrived at our destined port i think it but my duty to inform you my friends that this lady taking her hand has placed herself under my protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen and severely felt the anguish of her heart and through every shade which cruelty or malice may throw over her can discover the most amiable qualities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it but necessary to mention my esteem for her before our disembarkation as it is my fixed resolution the morning after we land to give her an undoubted title to my favour and protection by honourably uniting my fate to hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would wish every gentleman here therefore to remember that her honour henceforth is mine and continued he looking at belcour should any man presume to speak in the least disrespectfully of her i shall not hesitate to pronounce him a scoundrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belcour cast at him a smile of contempt and bowing profoundly low wished mademoiselle much joy in the proposed union and assuring the colonel that he need not be in the least apprehensive of any one throwing the least odium on the character of his lady shook him by the hand with ridiculous gravity and left the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth was he was glad to be rid of la rue and so he was but freed from her he cared not who fell a victim to her infamous arts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inexperienced charlotte was astonished at what she heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought la rue had like herself only been urged by the force of her attachment to belcour to quit her friends and follow him to the feat of war how wonderful then that she should resolve to marry another man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we knows each others ways and often gives relief when others fail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our charges is but low sirmrs gamp addressed herself to john on this headconsiderin the nater of our painful dooty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they wos made accordin to our wishes they regarding herself as having now delivered her inauguration address mrs gamp curtseyed all round and signified her wish to be conducted to the scene of her official duties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chambermaid led her through a variety of intricate passages to the top of the house and pointing at length to a solitary door at the end of a gallery informed her that yonder was the chamber where the patient lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that done she hurried off with all the speed she could make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs gamp traversed the gallery in a great heat from having carried her large bundle up so many stairs and tapped at the door which was immediately opened by mrs prig bonneted and shawled and all impatience to be gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs prig was of the gamp build but not so fat and her voice was deeper and more like a mans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it shall be made good tomorrow night said mrs gamp honorable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to go and fetch my things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had begun to make signs of inquiry in reference to the position of the patient and his overhearing themfor there was a screen before the doorwhen mrs prig settled that point easily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said aloud hes quiet but his wits is gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it ant no anythin to tell afore you goes my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked mrs gamp setting her bundle down inside the door and looking affectionately at her partner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pickled salmon mrs prig replied is quite delicious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont have nothink to say to the cold mrs gamp expressed herself much gratified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the physic and them things is on the drawers and mankleshelf said mrs prig cursorily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took his last slime draught at seven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mrs gamp thanked her for these hints and giving her a friendly good night held the door open until she had disappeared at the other end of the gallery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having thus performed the hospitable duty of seeing her safely off she shut it locked it on the inside took up her bundle walked round the screen and entered on her occupation of the sick chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little dull but not so bad as might be mrs gamp remarked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im glad to see a parapidge in case of fire and lots of roofs and it will be seen from these remarks that mrs gamp was looking out of window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had exhausted the prospect she tried the easychair which she indignantly declared was harder than a brickbadge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next she pursued her researches among the physicbottles glasses jugs and teacups and when she had entirely satisfied her curiosity on all these subjects of investigation she untied her bonnetstrings and strolled up to the bedside to take a look at the patient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a young mandark and not illlookingwith long black hair that seemed the blacker for the whiteness of the bedclothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes were partly open and he never ceased to roll his head from side to side upon the pillow keeping his body almost quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not utter words but every now and then gave vent to an expression of impatience or fatigue sometimes of surprise and still his restless headoh weary weary hour!went to and fro without a moments intermission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs gamp solaced herself with a pinch of snuff and stood looking at him with her head inclined a little sideways as a connoisseur might gaze upon a doubtful work of art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees a horrible remembrance of one branch of her calling took possession of the woman and stooping down she pinned his wandering arms against his sides to see how he would look if laid out as a dead man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her fingers itched to compose his limbs in that last marble attitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said mrs gamp walking away from the bed hed make a lovely she now proceeded to unpack her bundle lighted a candle with the aid of a firebox on the drawers filled a small kettle as a preliminary to refreshing herself with a cup of tea in the course of the night laid what she called a little bit of fire for the same philanthropic purpose and also set forth a small teaboard that nothing might be wanting for her comfortable enjoyment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these preparations occupied so long that when they were brought to a conclusion it was high time to think about supper so she rang the bell and ordered it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think young woman said mrs gamp to the assistant chambermaid in a tone expressive of weakness that i could pick a little bit of pickled salmon with a nice little sprig of fennel and a sprinkling of white pepper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i takes new bread my dear with just a little pat of fresh butter and a mossel of cheese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in case there should be such a thing as a cowcumber in the ouse will you be so kind as bring it for im rather partial to em and they does a world of good in a sick room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they draws the brighton old tipper here i takes that ale at night my love it bein considered wakeful by the doctors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and whatever you do young woman dont bring more than a shillingsworth of gin and waterwarm when i rings the bell a second time for that is always my allowance and i never takes a having preferred these moderate requests mrs gamp observed that she would stand at the door until the order was executed to the end that the patient might not be disturbed by her opening it a second a tray was brought with everything upon it even to the cucumber and mrs gamp accordingly sat down to eat and drink in high good humour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the extent to which she availed herself of the vinegar and supped up that refreshing fluid with the blade of her knife can scarcely be expressed in narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sighed mrs gamp as she meditated over the warm shillings worth what a blessed thing it isliving in a waleto be contented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a blessed thing it is to make sick people happy in their beds and never mind ones self as long as one can do a service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe a finer cowcumber was ever growd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure she moralised in the same vein until her glass was empty and then admistered the patients medicine by the simple process of clutching his windpipe to make him gasp and immediately pouring it down his throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now hes comfortable as he can be im sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must with this view she went about the construction of an extemporaneous bed in the easychair with the addition of the next easy one for her feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having formed the best couch that the circumstances admitted of she took out of her bundle a yellow nightcap of prodigious size in shape resembling a cabbage which article of dress she fixed and tied on with the utmost care previously divesting herself of a row of bald old curls that could scarcely be called false they were so very innocent of anything approaching to deception <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the same repository she brought forth a nightjacket in which she also attired herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally she produced a watchmans coat which she tied round her neck by the sleeves so that she become two people and looked behind as if she were in the act of being embraced by one of the old patrol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all these arrangements made she lighted the rushlight coiled herself up on her couch and went to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ghostly and dark the room became and full of lowering shadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the distant noises in the streets were gradually hushed the house was quiet as a sepulchre the dead of might was coffined in the silent city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh haggard mind groping darkly through the past incapable of detaching itself from the miserable present dragging its heavy chain of care through imaginary feasts and revels and scenes of awful pomp seeking but a moments rest among the longforgotten haunts of childhood and the resorts of yesterday and dimly finding fear and horror everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what were the wanderings of cain to these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still without a moments interval the burning head tossed to and fro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still from time to time fatigue impatience suffering and surprise found utterance upon that rack and plainly too though never once in words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length in the solemn hour of midnight he began to talk waiting awfully for answers sometimes as though invisible companions were about his bed and so replying to their speech and questioning again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs gamp awoke and sat up in her bed presenting on the wall the shadow of a gigantic night constable struggling with a prisoner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont make there was no alteration in the face or in the incessant motion of the head but he talked on wildly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said mrs gamp coming out of the chair with an impatient shiver i thought i was asleepin too pleasant to last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at the mark where the sparkling water indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill have a sparkling he burst into a laugh which being prolonged fell off into a dismal wail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> checking himself with fierce inconstancy he began to countfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one two buckle my shoe said mrs gamp who was now on her knees lighting the fire three four shut the doori wish youd shut your mouth young manfive six picking up sticks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if id got a few handy i should have the kettle boiling all the awaiting this desirable consummation she sat down so close to the fender which was a high one that her nose rested upon it and for some time she drowsily amused herself by sliding that feature backwards and forwards along the brass top as far as she could without changing her position to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she maintained all the while a running commentary upon the wanderings of the man in bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that makes five hundred and twentyone men all dressed alike and with the same distortion on their faces that have passed in at the window and out at the door he cried anxiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see em said mrs gamp all the whole kit of em numbered youll take your next draught when ive made the kettle bile retorted mrs gamp composedly and youll be touched then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll five hundred and twentyeight five hundred and twentynine five whats the matter now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre coming four abreast each man with his arm entwined in the next mans and his hand upon his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats that upon the spiders praps said mrs gamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you have em carry black crape in their insides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs gamp the fire beginning by this time to impart a grateful warmth mrs gamp became silent gradually rubbed her nose more and more slowly along the top of the fender and fell into a heavy doze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was the sound was so distinct and real and so full of agonised entreaty that mrs gamp jumped up in terror and ran to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she expected to find the passage filled with people come to tell her that the house in the city had taken fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the place was empty not a soul was there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she passed to her seat again she glanced at the patient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs gamp was so warm now that she threw off the watchmans coat and fanned herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to make the wery bottles ring she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what could i the supposition was probable enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate a pinch of snuff and the song of the steaming kettle quite restored the tone of mrs gamps nerves which were none of the weakest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she brewed her tea made some buttered toast and sat down at the teaboard with her face to the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when once again in a tone more terrible than that which had mrs gamp dropped the cup she was in the act of raising to her lips and turned round with a start that made the little teaboard leap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was bright morning the next time mrs gamp looked out of the window and the sun was rising cheerfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lighter and lighter grew the sky and noisier the streets and high into the summer air uprose the smoke of newly kindled fires until the busy day was broad awake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs prig relieved punctually having passed a good night at her other patients <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr westlock came at the same time but he was not admitted the disorder being infectious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all he could do under the circumstances and he did it well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the doctor we must keep him quiet keep the room cool give him his draughts regularly and see that hes carefully and as long as mrs prig and me waits upon him sir no fear of that said mrs gamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose observed mrs prig when they had curtseyed the doctor nothin at all my dear said mrs gamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes rather wearin in his talk from making up a lot of names elseways you neednt mind oh i shant mind him mrs prig returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have somethin else i pays my debts tonight you know my dear and comes afore my time said mrs gamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but betsy prigspeaking with great feeling and laying her hand upon her armtry the cowcumbers god the laws of sympathy between beards and birds and the secret source of that attraction which frequently impels a shaver of the one to be a dealer in the other are questions for the subtle reasoning of scientific bodies not the less so because their investigation would seem calculated to lead to no particular result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is enough to know that the artist who had the honour of entertaining mrs gamp as his firstfloor lodger united the two pursuits of barbering and birdfancying and that it was not an original idea of his but one in which he had dispersed about the bystreets and suburbs of the town a host of rivals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the name of the householder was paul sweedlepipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was commonly called poll sweedlepipe and was not uncommonly believed to have been so christened among his friends and neighbours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the exception of the staircase and his lodgers private apartment poll sweedlepipes house was one great birds nest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gamecocks resided in the kitchen pheasants wasted the brightness of their golden plumage on the garret bantams roosted in the cellar owls had possession of the bedroom and specimens of all the smaller fry of birds chirrupped and twittered in the shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there in hutches of all shapes and kinds made from old packingcases boxes drawers and teachests they increased in a prodigious degree and contributed their share towards that complicated whiff which quite impartially and without distinction of persons saluted every nose that was put into sweedlepipes easy shavingshop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many noses found their way there for all that especially on sunday morning before churchtime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even archbishops shave or must be shaved on a sunday and beards will grow after twelve oclock on saturday night though it be upon the chins of base mechanics who not being able to engage their valets by the quarter hire them by the job and pay themoh the wickedness of copper coin!in dirty pence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poll sweedlepipe the sinner shaved all comers at a penny each and cut the hair of any customer for twopence and being a lone unmarried man and having some connection in the bird line poll got on tolerably well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a little elderly man with a clammy cold right hand from which even rabbits and birds could not remove the smell of shaving soap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poll had something of the bird in his nature not of the hawk or eagle but of the sparrow that builds in chimneystacks and inclines to human company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not quarrelsome though like the sparrow but peaceful like the dove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his walk he strutted and in this respect he bore a faint resemblance to the pigeon as well as in a certain prosiness of speech which might in its monotony be likened to the cooing of that bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very inquisitive and when he stood at his shopdoor in the eveningtide watching the neighbours with his head on one side and his eye cocked knowingly there was a dash of the raven in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet there was no more wickedness in poll than in a robin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> happily too when any of his ornithological properties were on the verge of going too far they were quenched dissolved melted down and neutralised in the barber just as his bald headotherwise as the head of a shaved magpie lost itself in a wig of curly black ringlets parted on one side and cut away almost to the crown to indicate immense capacity of intellect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poll had a very small shrill treble voice which might have led the wags of kingsgate street to insist the more upon his feminine designation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a tender heart too for when he had a good commission to provide three or four score sparrows for a shooting match he would observe in a compassionate tone how singular it was that sparrows should have been made expressly for such purposes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the question whether men were made to shoot them never entered into polls philosophy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poll wore in his sporting character a velveteen coat a great deal of blue stocking ankle boots a neckerchief of some bright colour and a very tall hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pursuing his more quiet occupation of barber he generally subsided into an apron not overclean a flannel jacket and corduroy kneeshorts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in this latter costume but with his apron girded round his waist as a token of his having shut up shop for the night that he closed the door one evening some weeks after the occurrences detailed in the last chapter and stood upon the steps in kingsgate street listening until the little cracked bell within should leave off ringing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for until it did this was mr sweedlepipes reflectionthe place never seemed quiet enough to be left to itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the greediest little bell to ring said poll that ever was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rolled his apron up a little tighter as he said these words and hastened down the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as he was turning into holborn he ran against a young gentleman in a livery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this youth was bold though small and with several lively expressions of displeasure turned upon him instantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think your eyes was made foreh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the young gentleman pronounced the two last words in a very loud tone and with frightful emphasis as though they contained within themselves the essence of the direst aggravation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had scarcely done so when his anger yielded to surprise and he cried no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a credit to his father ant he polly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this delicate little piece of banter he halted on the pavement and went round and round in circles for the better exhibition of his figure rather to the inconvenience of the passengers generally who were not in an equal state of spirits with himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returned his young friend who had by this time stuck his hands into the pockets of his white cord breeches and was swaggering along at the barbers side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dye know a pair of top beautiful cried mr sweedlepipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dye know a slapup sort of button when you see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont look at mine if you aint a judge because these beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a grassgreen frockcoat i should hope so replied the youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blow the cockade though for except that it dont turn round its like the wentilator that used to be in the kitchen winder at todgerss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you aint seen the if she aint she will be retorted bailey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you living at this end of the town or were you coming to see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was that the bisness that i havent got no bisness in holborn returned bailey with some displeasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all my bisness lays at the west end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got the right sort of governor now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant see his face for his whiskers and cant see his whiskers for the dye upon em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wouldnt like a ride in a cab would you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why it wouldnt be safe to offer it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd faint away only to see to convey a slight idea of the effect of this approach mr bailey counterfeited in his own person the action of a hightrotting horse and threw up his head so high in backing against a pump that he shook his hat off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why hes own uncle to capricorn said bailey and brother to cauliflower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes been through the winders of two chaney shops since weve had him and was sold for killin his missis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll never want to buy any more red polls now observed poll looking on his young friend with an air of melancholy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll never want to buy any more red polls now to hang up over i should think not replied bailey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt have nothin to say to any bird below a peacock and hed be wulgar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he answered the question again because mr bailey asked it again mr bailey asked it again because accompanied with a straddling action of the white cords a bend of the knees and a striking forth of the topbootsit was an easy horsefleshy turfy sort of thing to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> added mr bailey with the same graceful rakishness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was quite the manabouttown of the conversation while the easyshaver was the child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i am going to fetch my lodger home said paul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little barber hastened to explain that she was neither a young woman nor a handsome woman but a nurse who had been acting as a kind of housekeeper to a gentleman for some weeks past and left her place that night in consequence of being superseded by another and a more legitimate housekeeperto wit the gentlemans bride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes newly married and he brings his young wife home tonight said the barber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so im going to fetch my lodger awaymr chuzzlewits close behind the post officeand carry her box for jonas chuzzlewits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said mr bailey with a wink and she aint bad looking mind you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i often mr bailey spoke as if he already had a leg and threequarters in the grave and this had happened twenty or thirty years ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul sweedlepipe the meek was so perfectly confounded by his precocious selfpossession and his patronizing manner as well as by his boots cockade and livery that a mist swam before his eyes and he sawnot the bailey of acknowledged juvenility from todgerss commercial boarding house who had made his acquaintance within a twelvemonth by purchasing at sundry times small birds at twopence eachbut a highlycondensed embodiment of all the sporting grooms in london an abstract of all the stableknowledge of the time a something at a highpressure that must have had existence many years and was fraught with terrible experiences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and truly though in the cloudy atmosphere of todgerss mr baileys genius had ever shone out brightly in this particular respect it now eclipsed both time and space cheated beholders of their senses and worked on their belief in defiance of all natural laws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked along the tangible and real stones of holborn hill an undersized boy and yet he winked the winks and thought the thoughts and did the deeds and said the sayings of an ancient man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an old principle within him and a young surface without <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he became an inexplicable creature a breeched and booted sphinx <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no course open to the barber but to go distracted himself or to take bailey for granted and he wisely chose the latter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr bailey was good enough to continue to bear him company and to entertain him as they went with easy conversation on various sporting topics especially on the comparative merits as a general principle of horses with white stockings and horses without <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in regard to the style of tail to be preferred mr bailey had opinions of his own which he explained but begged they might by no means influence his friends as here he knew he had the misfortune to differ from some excellent authorities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he treated mr sweedlepipe to a dram compounded agreeably to his own directions which he informed him had been invented by a member of the jockey club and as they were by this time near the barbers destination he observed that as he had an hour to spare and knew the parties he would if quite agreeable be introduced to mrs gamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul knocked at jonas chuzzlewits and on the door being opened by that lady made the two distinguished persons known to one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a happy feature in mrs gamps twofold profession that it gave her an interest in everything that was young as well as in everything that was old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its very good im sure of you to come she said to her landlord as well as bring so nice a friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im afraid that i must trouble you so far as to step in for the young couple theyre late aint they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired her landlord when she had conducted them downstairs into the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir considern the wings of love they are said mrs gamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr bailey inquired whether the wings of love had ever won a plate or could be backed to do anything remarkable and being informed that it was not a horse but merely a poetical or figurative expression evinced considerable disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs gamp was so very much astonished by his affable manners and great ease that she was about to propound to her landlord in a whisper the staggering inquiry whether he was a man or a boy when mr sweedlepipe anticipating her design made a timely diversion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres nothin he dont know thats my opinion observed mrs mr bailey received this as a compliment and said adjusting his as you knows mrs chuzzlewit you knows praps what her chrisen name is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all the it dont begin with a c at all retorted mrs gamp shaking her whew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried mr bailey slapping a little cloud of pipeclay out of as these words were mysterious mrs gamp called upon him to explain which mr bailey proceeded to do that lady listening greedily to everything he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was yet in the fullness of his narrative when the sound of wheels and a double knock at the street door announced the arrival of the newly married couple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> begging him to reserve what more he had to say for her hearing on the way home mrs gamp took up the candle and hurried away to receive and welcome the young mistress of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wishing you appiness and joy with all my art said mrs gamp dropping a curtsey as they entered the hall and you too sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your lady looks a little tired with the journey mr chuzzlewit a she has bothered enough about it grumbled mr jonas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now show a this way maam if you please said mrs gamp going upstairs before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> things has been made as comfortable as they could be but theres many things youll have to alter your own self when you gets time to look about you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you dont added mrs gamp internally you dont look much like a merry one i must it was true she did not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the death that had gone before the bridal seemed to have left its shade upon the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air was heavy and oppressive the rooms were dark a deep gloom filled up every chink and corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the hearthstone like a creature of ill omen sat the aged clerk with his eyes fixed on some withered branches in the stove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so there you are mr chuff said jonas carelessly as he dusted still in the land of the living sir retorted mrs gamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mr chuffey may thank you for it as many and many a time ive told mr jonas was not in the best of humours for he merely said as he im agoing immediate sir returned the nurse unless theres nothink i can do for you maam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aint there said mrs gamp with a look of great sweetness and rummaging all the time in her pocket with a leer of mingled sweetness and slyness with one eye on the future one on the bride and an arch expression in her face partly spiritual partly spirituous and wholly professional and peculiar to her art mrs gamp rummaged in her pocket again and took from it a printed card whereon was an inscription copied from her signboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you be so good my darling dovey of a dear young married lady mrs gamp observed in a low voice as put that somewheres where you can keep it in your mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im well beknown to many ladies and its my card <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gamp is my name and gamp my nater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> livin quite handy i will make so bold as call in now and then and and with innumerable leers winks coughs nods smiles and curtseys all leading to the establishment of a mysterious and confidential understanding between herself and the bride mrs gamp invoking a blessing upon the house leered winked coughed nodded smiled and curtseyed herself out of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i will say and i would if i was led a martha to the stakes for it mrs gamp remarked below stairs in a whisper that she dont ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they said no more in the house for mrs gamp put on her bonnet mr sweedlepipe took up her box and mr bailey accompanied them towards kingsgate street recounting to mrs gamp as they went along the origin and progress of his acquaintance with mrs chuzzlewit and her sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a pleasant instance of this youths precocity that he fancied mrs gamp had conceived a tenderness for him and was much tickled by her misplaced attachment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the left lung was collapsed and the exit point of the ball had been found in the muscles of the back to the left of the spinal column <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was improbable that such a wound had been self inflicted and its oblique downward course pointed to the fact that the shot had been fired from above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in other words as the murdered man had been found dead at the foot of a staircase it was probable that the shot had been fired by some one higher up on the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bullet a thirtyeight caliber had been found in the dead mans clothing and was shown to the jury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jarvis was called next but his testimony amounted to little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been summoned by telephone to sunnyside had come over at once with the steward and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had been admitted by the housekeeper and had found the body lying at the foot of the staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had made a search for a weapon but there was none around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the outer entry door in the east wing had been unfastened and was open about an inch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been growing more and more nervous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john bailey the room was filled with suppressed excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jamieson went forward and spoke a few words to the coroner who nodded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> innes the coroner said will you tell under what circumstances you saw mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw him first at the country club halsey said quietly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stopped there with my automobile for gasolene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i saw him there he was coming out of the cardroom talking to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bailey to leave the club with me and come to sunnyside over sunday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bailey away from the clubhouse because you were afraid there would be blows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that time had you any suspicion that the traders bank had been wrecked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bailey and i talked in the billiardroom until twothirty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arnold armstrong came there while you were talking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rapped at the east door and i admitted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you tell us the nature of his errand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he brought a telegram that had come to the club for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was not his apparent friendliness a change from his former attitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we talked for a few minutes discussing a plan mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i went to the stables where i kept my car and got it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ogden fitzhugh had the courage to turn and eye gertrude through her lorgnon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took the car along the lower road not to disturb the household <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bailey came down across the lawn through the hedge and got into the car on the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i read of his death monday evening for the first time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bailey did not see him on his way across the lawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had seen him he would have spoken of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrudes replies were fully as concise as halseys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fitzhugh subjected her to a close inspection commencing with her hat and ending with her shoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i flatter myself she found nothing wrong with either her gown or her manner but poor gertrudes testimony was the reverse of comforting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been summoned she said by her brother after mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had waited in the billiardroom with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she had locked the door at the foot of the staircase and taking a lamp had accompanied mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bailey to the main entrance of the house and had watched him cross the lawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of going at once to her room she had gone back to the billiardroom for something which had been left there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had groped around found the article she was looking for and was on the point of returning to her room when she had heard some one fumbling at the lock at the east outer door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had thought it was probably her brother and had been about to go to the door when she heard it open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost immediately there was a shot and she had run panicstricken through the drawingroom and had roused the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no voices and i heard nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was just the opening of the door the shot and the sound of somebody falling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then while you went through the drawingroom and upstairs to alarm the household the criminal whoever it was could have escaped by the east door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i flatter myself that the coroner got little enough out of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jamieson smiling to himself and the coroner gave me up after a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i admitted i had found the body said i had not known who it was until mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jarvis told me and ended by looking up at barbara fitzhugh and saying that in renting the house i had not expected to be involved in any family scandal <end> <end>

<start> <start> unknown to her father miss wilson could permit these two slaves to enjoy more privileges than any of the other servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young mistress taught clotelle and the latter imparted her instructions to her lover until both could read so as to be well understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jerome felt his superiority and always declared that no master should ever flog him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aware of his high spirit and determination clotelle was in constant fear lest some difficulty might arise between her lover and his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wilson being somewhat out of temper and irritated at what he was pleased to call jeromes insolence ordered him to follow him to the barn to be flogged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young slave obeyed his master but those who saw him at the moment felt that he would not submit to be whipped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sir replied jerome as his master told him to take off his coat i will serve you master wilson i will labor for you day and night if you demand it but i will not be whipped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was too much for a white man to stand from a negro and the preacher seized his slave by the throat intending to choke him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jerome knocked him down and then escaped through the backyard to the street and from thence to the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> recovering somewhat from the effect of his fall the parson regained his feet and started in pursuit of the fugitive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finding however that the slave was beyond his reach he at once resolved to put the dogs on his track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tabor the negrocatcher was sent for and in less than an hour eight or ten men including the parson were in the woods with hounds trying the trails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these dogs will attack a negro at their masters bidding and cling to him as the bulldog will cling to a beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many are the speculations as to whether the negro will be secured alive or dead when these dogs once get on his track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever there is to be a negro hunt there is no lack of participants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many go to enjoy the fun which it is said they derive from these scenes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the company had been in the woods but a short time ere they go on the track of two fugitives once of whom was jerome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slaves immediately bent their steps toward the swamp with the hope that the dogs when put upon their scent would be unable to follow them through the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slaves then took a straight course for the baton rouge and bayou sara road about four miles distant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nearer and nearer the whimpering pack pressed their delusion begins to dispel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all at once the truth flashes upon the minds of the fugitives like a glare of lighttis tabor with his dogs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scent becomes warmer and warmer and what was at first an irregular cry now deepens into one ceaseless roar as the relentless pack presses on after its human prey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they at last reach the river and in the negroes plunge followed by the catchdog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jerome is caught and is once more in the hands of his master while the other poor fellow finds a watery grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they return and the preacher sends his slave to jail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain did georgiana try to console clotelle when the latter heard through one of the other slaves that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wilson had started with the dogs in pursuit of jerome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor girl well knew that he would be caught and that severe punishment if not death would be the result of his capture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was therefore with a heart filled with the deepest grief that the slavegirl heard the footsteps of her master on his return from the chase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dogged and stern manner of the preacher forbade even his daughter inquiring as to the success of his pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> georgiana secretly hoped that the fugitive had not bee caught she wished it for the sake of the slave and more especially for her maidservant whom she regarded more as a companion than a menial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the news of the capture of jerome soon spread through the parsons household and found its way to the ears of the weeping and heartstricken clotelle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reverend gentleman had not been home more than an hour ere some of his parishioners called to know if they should not take the negro from the prison and execute lynch law upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no negro should be permitted to live after striking a white man let us take him and hang him at once remarked an elderlylooking man whose gray hairs thinly covered the crown of his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think the deacon is right said another of the company if our slaves are allowed to set the will of their masters at defiance there will be no getting along with them an insurrection will be the next thing we hear of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no said the preacher i am willing to let the law take its course as it provides for the punishment of a slave with death if he strikes his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had better let the court decide the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray rest a little mademoiselle he entreated there is no hurry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she shook her head and replied it is better to go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should never have courage to begin again if i paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thereupon she continued i had never gone farther than versailles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this journey was at first as delightful as a glimpse into fairyland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our carriage was one of those costly whims which some millionaires indulge in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it consisted of a central saloona perfect chefdoeuvre of taste and luxurywith two compartments at either end furnished with comfortable sleeping accommodation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all this the count seemed never weary of repeating was mine mine alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leaning back on the velvet cushions i gazed at the changing landscape as the train rushed madly on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de chalusse named all the towns and villages we passed brunoy melun fontainebleau villeneuve sens laroche <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and each time the train stopped the servants came to ask if we wished for anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we reached lyons in the middle of the night we found a delicious supper awaiting us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was served as soon as we alighted and in due time we were warned that the train was ready to start and then we resumed our journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can imagine perhaps how marvellous all this seemed to a poor little apprentice whose only ambition a week before was to earn five francs a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the count made me retire to one of the compartments where i soon fell asleep abandoning my efforts to distinguish what was dreamlike in my situation from reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however when i woke up i became terribly anxious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked myself what was awaiting me at the end of this long journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de chalusses manner continued kind and even affectionate but he had regained his accustomed reserve and self control and i realized that it would be useless on my part to question him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last after a thirty hours journey by rail we again entered the counts berline drawn by posthorses and eventually m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de chalusse said to me here is canneswe are at in this town which is one of the most charming that overlook the blue waters of the mediterranean the count owned a palace embowered among lovely orangetrees only a few steps from the sea and in full view of the myrtle and laurel groves which deck the isles of sainte marguerite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion so as to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury that surrounded me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was indeed extremely awkward and my excessive timidity was increased by my pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not know what to say or what to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not know how to use my hands nor how to walk nor how to carry myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything embarrassed and frightened me and i was conscious of my awkwardness without being able to remedy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw my blunders and knew that i spoke a different language to that which was spoken around me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet the memory of cannes will ever be dear to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for there i first met the only friend i have now left in this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not exchange a word with him but by the quickened throbbings of my heart when our eyes met i felt that he would exert a powerful influence over my life and events have since proved that i was not deceived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that time however he was a stranger to me and nothing on earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only by chance i learned that he lived in paris that his name was pascal and that he had come south as a companion to a sick friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by a single word the count could have insured the happiness of my life and his own but he did not speak it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the kindest and most indulgent of guardians and i was often affected to tears by his tenderness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but although my slightest wish was law he did not grant me his confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the secretthe mystery that stood between uswas like a wall of ice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still i was gradually becoming accustomed to my new life and my mind was regaining its equilibrium when one evening the count returned home more agitated and excited if possible than on the day of my departure from the asylum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he summoned his valet and in a tone that admitted no reply he exclaimed i wish to leave cannes at once i must start in less than an hourso procure some posthorses instantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in answer to my inquiring glance he said it must be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each moment increases i was very young inexperienced and totally ignorant of life but my sufferings my loneliness and the prospect of being compelled to rely upon myself had imparted to my mind that precocious maturity which is so often observed among the children of the poor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knowing from the very first that there was some mystery connected with the counts life i had studied him with a childs patient sagacitya sagacity which is all the more dangerous as it is unsuspectedand i had come to the conclusion that a constant dread rendered his life a burden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could it be for himself that he trembled this great nobleman who was so powerful by reason of his exalted rank his connections and his wealth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had not taken me long to discover that he was concealing me or at least that he endeavored by all means in his power to prevent my presence in his house from being known beyond a very limited circle of friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our hurried departure from cannes confirmed me in my impression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might have been truly called a flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we left that same evening at eleven oclock in a pouring rain with the first horses that could be procured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our only attendant was the counts valetnot casimir the man who insulted me a little while ago but another man an old and valued servant who has since died unfortunately and who possessed his masters entire confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other servants were dismissed with a princely gratuity and told to disperse two days after our departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we did not return to paris but journeyed toward the italian frontier and on arriving at nice in the dead of night we drove directly to the quay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the postilions unharnessed the horses and we remained in the carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the valet however hastened off and more than two hours elapsed before he returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he declared that he had found it very difficult to procure what he wished for but that at last by a prodigal outlay of money he had succeeded in overcoming all obstacles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de chalusse desired was a vessel ready for sea and the bark which the valet had chartered now came up to the quay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our carriage was put on board we went below and before daybreak we were under way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three days later we were in genoa registered under a false name in a second class hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while we were on the open sea the count had seemed to be less agitated but now he was far from calm and the precautions he took proved that he still feared pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a malefactor flying from justice could not have taken greater pains to mislead the detectives on his track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and facts proved conclusively that i was the sole cause of the counts apprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one occasion i even heard him discussing with his valet the feasibility of clothing me in masculine attire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was only the difficulty of obtaining a suitable costume that prevented him from carrying this project into execution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to mention however that the servant did not share his masters anxiety for three or four times i overheard him saying the count is too good to worry himself so much about such bad stock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt certain that she has even followed us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is what i racked my brain to discover but without success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must confess monsieur that being of a practical nature and not in the least degree romantic i arrived at the conclusion that the peril chiefly existed in the counts imagination or that he greatly exaggerated it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still he suffered none the less on that account as was shown by the fact that the following month was spent in hurried journeys from one italian city to another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the end of may before m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de chalusse would consent to return to france and then we went direct to lyons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had spent a couple of days there when the count informed me that prudence required us to separate for a timethat our safety demanded this sacrifice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and without giving me time to say a word he began to explain the advantages that would accrue from such an arrangement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was extremely ignorant and he wished me to profit by our temporary separation to raise my knowledge to a level with my new social position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had accordingly made arrangements for me to enter the convent of saintemarthe an educational establishment which is as celebrated in the department of the rhone as the convent des oiseaux is in paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added that it would not be prudent for him to visit me and he made me solemnly promise that i would never mention his name to any of my schoolmates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was to send any letters i might write to an address which he would give me and he would sign his answers with a fictitious name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he also told me that the lady superior of saintemarthe knew his secret and that i could confide in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was so restless and so miserably unhappy on the day when he acquainted me with these plans that i really believed him insane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless i replied that i would obey him and to tell the truth i was not ill pleased at the thought of the change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de chalusse was a monotonous and cheerless one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was almost dying of ennui for i had been accustomed to work bustle and confusion with the greloux and i felt delighted at the prospect of finding myself among companions of my own age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de chalusse had forgotten one circumstance which made my two years sojourn at saintemarthe a lingering and cruel agony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first i was kindly treated by my schoolmates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a new pupil is always welcome for her arrival relieves the monotony of conventlife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was not long before my companions wished to know my name and i had none other than marguerite to give them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were astonished and wished to know who my parents were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not tell an untruth and i was obliged to confess that i knew nothing at all respecting my father or my mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that the bastardfor such was the name they gave mewas soon condemned to isolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one would associate with me during playtime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one would sit beside me in the schoolroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the piano lesson the girl who played after me pretended to wipe the keyboard carefully before commencing her exercises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i struggled bravely against this unjust ostracism but all in vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was so unlike these other girls in character and disposition and i had moreover been guilty of a great imprudence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been silly enough to show my companions the costly jewels which m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de chalusse had given me but which i never wore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and on two occasions i had proved to them that i had more money at my disposal than all the other pupils together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had been poor they would perhaps have treated me with affected sympathy but as i was rich i became an enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was war and one of those merciless wars which sometimes rage so furiously in convents despite their seeming quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should surprise you monsieur if i told you what refined torture these daughters of noblemen invented to gratify their petty spite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might have complained to the superior but i scorned to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i buried my sorrow deep in my heart as i had done years before and i firmly resolved never to show ought but a smiling placid face so as to prove to my enemies that they were powerless to disturb my peace of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> study became my refuge and consolation and i plunged into work with the energy of despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should probably still live at saintemarthe now had it not been for a trivial circumstance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day i had a quarrel with my most determined enemy a girl named anais de rochecote <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a thousand times right and i would not yield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the superior dared not tell me i was wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anais was furious and wrote i dont know what falsehoods to her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de rochecote thereupon interested the mothers of five or six other pupils in her daughters quarrel and one evening these ladies came in a body and nobly and courageously demanded that the bastard should be expelled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was impossible outrageous monstrous they declared that their daughters should be compelled to associate with a girl like mea nameless girl who humiliated the other girls with her illgotten wealth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the superior tried to take my part but these ladies declared they would take their daughters from the convent if i were not sent away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no help for it i was sacrificed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de chalusse hastened to lyons and two days later i left saintemarthe with jeers and opprobrious epithets ringing in my ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once before that very morning the magistrate had witnessed a display of the virile energy with which misfortune and suffering had endowed this proud but naturally timid girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was none the less surprised at the sudden explosion of hatred which he now beheld for it was hatred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the way in which mademoiselle marguerites voice had quivered as she pronounced the name of anais de rochecote proved unmistakably that hers was one of those haughty natures that never forget an insult <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gordons devotion is quite capable of taking a new formof inventing a new kindness every day in the year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blanche looked at him an instant with less than her usual consciousness of her momentary pose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my husband is very kind she said gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had hardly spoken the words when gordon came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped a moment on seeing bernard glanced at his wife blushed flushed and with a loud frank exclamation of pleasure grasped his friend by both hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so long since he had seen bernard that he seemed a good deal moved he stood there smiling clasping his hands looking him in the eyes unable for some moments to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bernard on his side was greatly pleased it was delightful to him to look into gordons honest face again and to return his manly grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he looked well he looked happy to see that was more delightful yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during these few instants while they exchanged a silent pledge of renewed friendship bernards elastic perception embraced several things besides the consciousness of his own pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw that gordon looked well and happy but that he looked older too and more serious more marked by life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked as if something had happened to himas in fact something had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bernard saw a latent spark in his friends eye that seemed to question his own for an impression of blanche to question it eagerly and yet to deprecate judgment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw toowith the fact made more vivid by gordons standing there beside her in his manly sincerity and throwing it into contrastthat blanche was the same little posturing coquette of a blanche whom at baden he would have treated it as a broad joke that gordon wright should dream of marrying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw in a word that it was what it had first struck him as being an incongruous union <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this was a good deal for bernard to see in the course of half a minute especially through the rather opaque medium of a feeling of irreflective joy and his impressions at this moment have a value only in so far as they were destined to be confirmed by larger opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have come a little sooner than we expected said gordon but you are all the more welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one should be notified when one wishes to make a good impression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah my dear lady said bernard you made your impression as far as i am concerneda long time ago and i doubt whether it would have gained anything today by your having prepared an effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were standing before the fireplace on the great hearthrug and blanche while she listened to this speech was feeling with uplifted arm for a curl that had strayed from her chignon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she prepares her effects very quickly said gordon laughing gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blanche kept her hand behind her head which was bent slightly forward her bare arm emerged from her hanging sleeve and with her eyes glancing upward from under her lowered brows she smiled at her two spectators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her husband laid his hand on bernards arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried and he spoke with a sort of tender delight in being sure at least of this point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told her so half an hour before you came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blanche was manifestly not in the least discomposed by this frank discussion of her charms for the air of distinguished esteem adopted by both of her companions diminished the crudity of their remarks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she gave a little pout of irritated modesty it was more becoming than anything she had done yetand declared that if they wished to talk her over they were very welcome but she should prefer their waiting till she got out of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she left them reminding bernard that he was to send for his luggage and remain and promising to give immediate orders for the preparation of his apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bernard opened the door for her to pass out she gave him a charming nod as he stood there and he turned back to gordon with the reflection of her smile in his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gordon was watching him gordon was dying to know what he thought of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a curious mania of gordons this wanting to know what one thought of the women he loved but bernard just now felt abundantly able to humor it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was so pleased at seeing him tightly married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she s a delightful creature bernard said with cordial vagueness shaking hands with his friend again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gordon glanced at him a moment and then coloring a little looked straight out of the window whereupon bernard remembered that these were just the terms in which at baden after his companions absence he had attempted to qualify angela vivian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gordon was conscioushe was conscious of the oddity of his situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it surprised you he said in a moment still looking out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you know said bernard everything surprises me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am of a very conjectural habit of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all sorts of ideas come into my head and yet when the simplest things happen i am always rather startled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i live in a reverie and i am perpetually waked up by people doing things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gordon transferred his eyes from the window to bernards face to his whole person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gordon looked at him from head to foot smiling and shaking his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have travelled in unknown lands you have had i suppose all sorts of adventures but you are the same man i used to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have the same way of representingof misrepresenting yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well if i am not changed said bernard i can ill afford to lose so valuable an art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking you altogether i am glad you are the same gordon answered simply but you must come into my part of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he was conscioushe was very conscious so bernard reflected during the two or three first days of his visit to his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gordon knew it must seem strange to so irreverent a critic that a man who had once aspired to the hand of so intelligent a girlputting other things asideas angela vivian should as the ghost in hamlet says have declined upon a young lady who in force of understanding was so very much miss vivians inferior and this knowledge kept him ill at his ease and gave him a certain pitiable awkwardness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bernards sense of the anomaly grew rapidly less acute he made various observations which helped it to seem natural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blanche was wonderfully pretty she was very graceful innocent amusing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since gordon had determined to marry a little goose he had chosen the animal with extreme discernment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had quite the plumage of a swan and it sailed along the stream of life with an extraordinary lightness of motion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked himself indeed at times whether blanche were really so silly as she seemed he doubted whether any woman could be so silly as blanche seemed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a suspicion at times that for ends of her own she was playing a partthe suspicion arising from the fact that as usually happens in such cases she overplayed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her empty chatter her futility her childish coquetry and frivolitysuch light wares could hardly be the whole substance of any womans being there was something beneath them which blanche was keeping out of sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes we went out a fishing in the lagoon and sometimes went ahunting in the woods or ascended to the mountain top by way of variety although peterkin always asserted that we went for the purpose of hailing any ship that might chance to heave in sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am certain that none of us wished to be delivered from our captivity for we were extremely happy and peterkin used to say that as we were very young we should not feel the loss of a year or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peterkin as i have said before was thirteen years of age jack eighteen and i fifteen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but jack was very tall strong and manly for his age the climate was so beautiful that it seemed to be a perpetual summer and as many of the fruittrees continued to bear fruit and blossom all the year round we never wanted for a plentiful supply of food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hogs too seemed rather to increase than diminish although peterkin was very frequent in his attacks on them with his spear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if at any time we failed in finding a drove we had only to pay a visit to the plumtree before mentioned where we always we employed ourselves very busily during this time in making various garments of cocoanut cloth as those with which we had landed were beginning to be very ragged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peterkin also succeeded in making excellent shoes out of the skin of the old hog in the following manner he first cut a piece of the hide of an oblong form a few inches longer than his foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this he soaked in water and while it was wet he sewed up one end of it so as to form a rough imitation of that part of the heel of a shoe where the seam is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this done he bored a row of holes all round the edge of the piece of skin through which a tough line was passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into the sewedup part of this shoe he thrust his heel then drawing the string tight the edges rose up and overlapped his foot all round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true there were a great many illlooking puckers in these shoes but we found them very serviceable notwithstanding and jack came at last to prefer them to his long boots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we ago made various other useful articles which added to our comfort and once or twice spoke of building us a house but we had so great an affection for the bower and withal found it so serviceable that we determined not to leave it nor to attempt the building of a house which in such a climate might turn out to be rather we often examined the pistol that we had found in the house on the other side of the island and peterkin wished much that we had powder and shot as it would render pigkilling much easier but after all we had become so expert in the use of our sling and bow diving in the water garden also continued to afford us as much pleasure as ever and peterkin began to be a little more expert in the water from constant practice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for jack and i we began to feel as if water were our native element and revelled in it with so much confidence and comfort that peterkin said he feared we would turn into fish some day and swim off and leave him adding that he had been for a long time observing that jack was becoming more and more like a shark every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon jack remarked that if he peterkin were changed into a fish he would certainly turn into nothing better or bigger than a shrimp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor peterkin did not envy us our delightful excursions under water except indeed when jack would dive down to the bottom of the water garden sit down on a rock and look up and make faces at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peterkin did feel envious then and often said he would give anything to be able to do that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was much amused when peterkin said this for if he could only have seen his own face when he happened to take a short dive he would have seen that jacks was far surpassed by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great difference being however that now while we were engaged with these occupations and amusements an event occurred one day which was as unexpected as it was jack and i were sitting as we were often wont to do on the rocks at spouting cliff and peterkin was wringing the water from his garments having recently fallen by accident into the sea a thing he was constantly doing when our attention was suddenly i cant imagine answered he ive noticed them for some time and fancied they were black seagulls but the more i look at them the more i feel convinced they are much larger than gulls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried peterkin shading his eyes with his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our hearts beat with excitement at the very thought of seeing human i think you are about right peterkin but they seem to me to move strangely for boats said jack in a low tone as if he were i noticed that a shade of anxiety crossed jacks countenance as he gazed long and intently at the two objects which were now nearing us fast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether warcanoes or not i cannot tell but this i know that all the natives of the south sea islands are fierce cannibals and they have little respect for strangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must hide if they land here which i earnestly hope they will not do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was greatly alarmed at jacks speech but i confess i thought less of what he said than of the earnest anxious manner in which he said it and it was with very uncomfortable feelings that how unfortunate said i as we gained the shelter of the bushes that we have forgotten our arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it matters not said jack here are clubs enough and to spare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he spoke he laid his hand on a bundle of stout poles of various sizes which peterkins everbusy hands had formed during our frequent visits to the cliff for no other purpose apparently we each selected a stout club according to our several tastes and lay down behind a rock whence we could see the canoes approach without ourselves being seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first we made an occasional remark on their appearance but after they entered the lagoon and drew near the beach we ceased to speak and gazed with intense we now observed that the foremost canoe was being chased by the other and that it contained a few women and children as well as men perhaps forty souls altogether while the canoe which pursued it contained only men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed to be about the same in number but were better armed and had the appearance of being a war party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both crews were paddling with all their might and it seemed as if the pursuers exerted themselves to overtake the natives ere they could land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foremost canoe made for the beach close beneath the rocks behind which we were concealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their short paddles flashed like meteors in the water and sent up a constant shower of spray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foam curled from the prow and the eyes of the rowers glistened in their black faces as they strained every muscle of their naked bodies nor did they relax their efforts till the canoe struck the beach with a violent shock then with a shout of defiance the whole party sprang as if by magic from the canoe to the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three women two of whom carried infants in their arms rushed into the woods and the men crowded to the waters edge with stones in their hands spears levelled and clubs brandished to resist the the distance between the two canoes had been about half a mile and at the great speed they were going this was soon passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the pursuers neared the shore no sign of fear or hesitation was noticeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on they came like a wild charger received but recked not of a shower of stones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the canoe struck and with a yell that seemed to issue from the throats of incarnate fiends the battle that immediately ensued was frightful to behold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the men wielded clubs of enormous size and curious shapes with which they dashed out each others brains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they were almost entirely naked and had to bound stoop leap and run in their terrible handtohand encounters they looked more like demons than human beings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt my heart grow sick at the sight of this bloody battle and would fain have turned away but a species of fascination seemed to hold me down and glue my eyes upon the combatants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i observed that the attacking party was led by a most extraordinary being who from his size and peculiarity i concluded was a chief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hair was frizzed out to an enormous extent so that it resembled a large turban <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was of a light yellow hue which surprised me much for the mans body was as black as coal and i felt convinced that the hair must have been dyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was tattooed from head to foot and his face besides being tattooed was besmeared with red paint and streaked with white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> altogether with his yellow turbanlike hair his herculean black frame his glittering eyes and white teeth he seemed the most terrible monster i ever beheld <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the news reached manfreds ears he bribed the guardians of the lady isabella to deliver her up to him as a bride for his son conrad by which alliance he had proposed to unite the claims of the two houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this motive on conrads death had cooperated to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her himself and the same reflection determined him now to endeavour at obtaining the consent of frederic to this marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a like policy inspired him with the thought of inviting frederics champion into the castle lest he should be informed of isabellas flight which he strictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the knights retinue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herald said manfred as soon as he had digested these reflections return to thy master and tell him ere we liquidate our differences by the sword manfred would hold some converse with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bid him welcome to my castle where by my faith as i am a true knight he shall have courteous reception and full security for himself and followers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we cannot adjust our quarrel by amicable means i swear he shall depart in safety and shall have full satisfaction according to the laws of arms so help me god and his holy trinity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during this interview jeromes mind was agitated by a thousand contrary passions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he trembled for the life of his son and his first thought was to persuade isabella to return to the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet he was scarce less alarmed at the thought of her union with manfred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dreaded hippolitas unbounded submission to the will of her lord and though he did not doubt but he could alarm her piety not to consent to a divorce if he could get access to her yet should manfred discover that the obstruction came from him it might be equally fatal to theodore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was impatient to know whence came the herald who with so little management had questioned the title of manfred yet he did not dare absent himself from the convent lest isabella should leave it and her flight be imputed to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he returned disconsolately to the monastery uncertain on what conduct to resolve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brother is it then true that we have lost our excellent princess hippolita <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the holy man started and cried what meanest thou brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i come this instant from the castle and left her in perfect health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martelli replied the other friar passed by the convent but a quarter of an hour ago on his way from the castle and reported that her highness was dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her happy transit to a better life and willed me to wait thy arrival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they know thy holy attachment to that good lady and are anxious for the affliction it will cause in thee indeed we have all reason to weep she was a mother to our house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this life is but a pilgrimage we must not murmur we shall all follow her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell thee i come from the castle and left the princess well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied the friar i told her the sad news and offered her spiritual comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reminded her of the transitory condition of mortality and advised her to take the veil i quoted the example of the holy princess sanchia of arragon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thy zeal was laudable said jerome impatiently but at present it was unnecessary hippolita is well at least i trust in the lord she is i heard nothing to the contrary yet methinks the princes earnestness well brother but where is the lady isabella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know not said the friar she wept much and said she would retire to her chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jerome left his comrade abruptly and hastened to the princess but she was not in her chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he inquired of the domestics of the convent but could learn no news of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he searched in vain throughout the monastery and the church and despatched messengers round the neighbourhood to get intelligence if she had been seen but to no purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put her hand upon it hurriedly a hand so thin and delicate that when i had seen her hold it up before the fire to shade her face i had compared it in my thoughts to fine porcelain and saying in a quick fierce passionate way i swear you to secrecy about this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steerforth was particularly happy in her sons society and steerforth was on this occasion particularly attentive and respectful to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was very interesting to me to see them together not only on account of their mutual affection but because of the strong personal resemblance between them and the manner in which what was haughty or impetuous in him was softened by age and sex in her to a gracious dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought more than once that it was well no serious cause of division had ever come between them or two such natures i ought rather to express it two such shades of the same nature might have been harder to reconcile than the two extremest opposites in creation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea did not originate in my own discernment i am bound to confess but in a speech of rosa dartles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh but do tell me though somebody because i have been thinking you want to know what rosa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray do i constantly entreat you said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you must really bear with me because i ask for information <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we never it has become a second nature said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steerforth without any displeasure but i remember and so must you i think when your manner was different rosa when it was not so guarded and i am sure you are right she returned and so it is that bad habits grow upon one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can i imperceptibly have changed i wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well thats i wish you would said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will learn you cannot learn frankness rosa said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steerforth quickly for there was always some effect of sarcasm in what rosa dartle said though it was said as this was in the most unconscious that i am sure of she answered with uncommon fervour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steerforth appeared to me to regret having been a little well my dear rosa we have not heard what it is that you want to that i want to be satisfied about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only whether people who are like each its as good a phrase as another said steerforth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you whether people who are like each other in their moral constitution are in greater danger than people not so circumstanced supposing any serious cause of variance to arise i should say yes said steerforth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> supposing then for instance any unlikely thing will do for a supposition that you my dear rosa interposed mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i am glad i have been so foolish as to put the case for it is so very good to know that your duty to each other would prevent it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one other little circumstance connected with miss dartle i must not omit for i had reason to remember it thereafter when all the irremediable past was rendered plain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the whole of this day but especially from this period of it steerforth exerted himself with his utmost skill and that was with his utmost ease to charm this singular creature into a pleasant and pleased companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he should succeed was no matter of surprise to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that she should struggle against the fascinating influence of his delightful art delightful nature i thought it then did not surprise me either for i knew that she was sometimes jaundiced and perverse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw her features and her manner slowly change i saw her look at him with growing admiration i saw her try more and more faintly but always angrily as if she condemned a weakness in herself to resist the captivating power that he possessed and finally i saw her sharp glance soften and her smile become quite gentle and i ceased to be afraid of her as i had really been all day and we all sat about the fire talking and laughing together with as little reserve as if we had been children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether it was because we had sat there so long or because steerforth was resolved not to lose the advantage he had gained i do not know but we did not remain in the diningroom more than five minutes after her departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is playing her harp said steerforth softly at the drawingroom door and nobody but my mother has heard her do that i believe these three years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said it with a curious smile which was gone directly and we went into the room and found her alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont get up said steerforth which she had already done my what do you care for an irish song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is daisy too loves music from his soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sing us an irish song he did not touch her or the chair from which she had risen but sat himself near the harp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood beside it for some little while in a curious way going through the motion of playing it with her right hand but not sounding it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length she sat down and drew it to her with one sudden action and played and sang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what it was in her touch or voice that made that song the most unearthly i have ever heard in my life or can imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something fearful in the reality of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as if it had never been written or set to music but sprung out of passion within her which found imperfect utterance in the low sounds of her voice and crouched again when all was still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was dumb when she leaned beside the harp again playing it but not sounding it with her right hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a minute more and this had roused me from my trance steerforth had left his seat and gone to her and had put his arm laughingly about her and had said come rosa for the future we will love each other very much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she had struck him and had thrown him off with the fury of a wild cat and had burst out of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has been an angel mother returned steerforth for a little while and has run into the opposite extreme since by way of you should be careful not to irritate her james <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her temper has rosa did not come back and no other mention was made of her until i went with steerforth into his room to say good night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he laughed about her and asked me if i had ever seen such a fierce little piece of incomprehensibility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i expressed as much of my astonishment as was then capable of expression and asked if he could guess what it was that she had taken so much amiss so suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you she took everything herself included to a grindstone and sharpened it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is an edgetool and requires good night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall be gone before he was unwilling to let me go and stood holding me out with a hand on each of my shoulders as he had done in my own room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> daisy he said with a smile for though thats not the name your godfathers and godmothers gave you its the name i like best to call you by and i wish i wish i wish you could give it to why so i can if i choose said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> daisy if anything should ever separate us you must think of me at my best old boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think of me you have no best to me steerforth said i and no worst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you so much compunction for having ever wronged him even by a shapeless thought did i feel within me that the confession of having done so was rising to my lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for the reluctance i had to betray the confidence of agnes but for my uncertainty how to approach the subject with no risk of doing so it would have reached them before he said god bless you daisy and good night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in my doubt it did not reach them and we shook hands and we parted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was up with the dull dawn and having dressed as quietly as i could looked into his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was fast asleep lying easily with his head upon his arm as i had often seen him lie at school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time came in its season and that was very soon when i almost wondered that nothing troubled his repose as i looked at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he slept let me think of him so again as i had often seen him sleep at school and thus in this silent hour i left him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to touch that passive hand in love and friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter i got down to yarmouth in the evening and went to the inn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that peggottys spare room my room was likely to have occupation enough in a little while if that great visitor before whose presence all the living must give place were not already in the house so i betook myself to the inn and dined there and engaged my bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was ten oclock when i went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many of the shops were shut and the town was dull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i came to omer and jorams i found the shutters up but the shop door standing open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i could obtain a perspective view of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer inside smoking his pipe by the parlour door i entered and asked him how he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer how do you find what not in your own eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer had made room for me and placed a chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he now sat down again very much out of breath gasping at his pipe as if it contained a supply of that necessary without which he must perish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry to have heard bad news of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer looked at me with a steady countenance and shook his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very question i should have put to you sir returned mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its one of the drawbacks of our line of business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a partys ill we cant ask how the the difficulty had not occurred to me though i had had my apprehensions too when i went in of hearing the old tune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on its being mentioned i recognized it however and said as much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless you it would be a shock that the generality of parties mightnt recover to say omer and jorams compliments and how do you find yourself this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer and i nodded at each other and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer recruited his wind by the aid of his pipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its one of the things that cut the trade off from attentions they could often wish to show said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i have known barkis a year to move to as he went by i have known him i felt it was rather hard on mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not more selfinterested i hope than another man said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wind may fail me at any moment and it aint likely that to my own knowledge id be selfinterested under such circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say it aint likely in a man who knows his wind will go when it does go as if a pair of bellows was cut open and that man a grandfather said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it aint that i complain of my line of business said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some good and some bad goes no doubt to all callings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i wish is that parties was brought up mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer with a very complacent and amiable face took several accordingly were obleeged in ascertaining how barkis goes on to limit ourselves to emly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knows what our real objects are and she dont have any more alarms or suspicions about us than if we was so many lambs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> minnie and joram have just stepped down to the house in fact shes there after hours helping her aunt a bit to ask her how he is tonight and if you was to please to wait till they come back theyd give you full particlers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i smoke on srub and water myself said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer taking up his glass because its considered softening to the passages by which this troublesome breath of mine gets into action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer huskily it aint the passages thats out of order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me breath enough said i to my daughter minnie and ill find he really had no breath to spare and it was very alarming to see him laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he was again in a condition to be talked to i thanked him for the proffered refreshment which i declined as i had just had dinner and observing that i would wait since he was so good as to invite me until his daughter and his soninlaw came back i inquired how little emily was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer removing his pipe that he might rub his chin i tell you truly i shall be glad when her marriage has why so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it aint that shes not as pretty as ever for shes prettier i do assure you she is prettier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it aint that she dont work as well as ever for she does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was worth any six and she is worth any six <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer after rubbing his chin again and smoking a little what i mean in a general way by the expression a long pull and a strong pull and a pull altogether my hearties hurrah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omers face and manner went for so much that i could conscientiously nod my head as divining his meaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my quickness of apprehension seemed to please him and he went on now i consider this is principally on account of her being in an unsettled state you see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have talked it over a good deal her uncle and myself and her sweetheart and myself after business and i consider it is principally on account of her being unsettled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must always recollect of emly said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer shaking his head gently that shes a most extraordinary affectionate little thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the proverb says you cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rather think you may if you begin early in life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has made a home out of that old i am sure she has <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to see the clinging of that pretty little thing to her uncle said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer to see the way she holds on to him tighter and tighter and closer and closer every day is to see a sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you know theres a struggle going on when thats the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i listened attentively to the good old fellow and acquiesced with all my heart in what he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said now dont consider emly nailed down in point of time at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her services have been more valuable than was supposed her learning has been quicker than was supposed omer and joram can run their pen through what remains and shes free when you wish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she likes to make any little arrangement afterwards in the way of doing any little thing for us at home very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer touching me with his pipe it aint likely that a man so short of breath as myself and a grandfather too would go and strain points with a little bit of a blueeyed blossom like not at all i am certain said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir her cousin of course you do said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her cousin being as it appears in good work and well to do thanked me in a very manly sort of manner for this conducting himself altogether i must say in a way that gives me a high opinion of him and went and took as comfortable a little house as you or i could wish to clap eyes on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that little house is now furnished right through as neat and complete as a dolls parlour and but for barkiss illness having taken this bad turn poor fellow they would have been man and wife i dare say by this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it is theres a why that you know he returned rubbing his double chin again cant naturally be expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prospect of the change and separation and all that is as one may say close to her and far away from her both at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barkiss death neednt put it off much but his lingering might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyway its an uncertain state of i see said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer emlys still a little down and a little fluttered perhaps upon the whole shes more so than she was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every day she seems to get fonder and fonder of her uncle and more loth to part from all of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a kind word from me brings the tears into her eyes and if you was to see her with my daughter minnies little girl youd never forget it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless my heart having so favourable an opportunity it occurred to me to ask mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer before our conversation should be interrupted by the return of his daughter and her husband whether he knew anything of martha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rejoined shaking his head and looking very much dejected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sad story sir however you come to know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never thought there was harm in the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt wish to mention it before my daughter minnie for shed take me up mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer hearing his daughters footstep before i heard it touched me with his pipe and shut up one eye as a caution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and her husband came in immediately afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barkis was as bad as bad could be that he was quite unconscious and that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chillip had mournfully said in the kitchen on going away just now that the college of physicians the college of surgeons and apothecaries hall if they were all called in together couldnt help him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chillip said and the hall could only poison him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty was there i determined to go to the house at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joram and directed my steps thither with a solemn feeling which made mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my low tap at the door was answered by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not so much surprised to see me as i had expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remarked this in peggotty too when she came down and i have seen it since and i think in the expectation of that dread surprise all other changes and surprises dwindle into nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty and passed into the kitchen while he softly closed the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little emily was sitting by the fire with her hands before her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we spoke in whispers listening between whiles for any sound in the room above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not thought of it on the occasion of my last visit but how strange it was to me now to miss mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is very kind of you masr davy said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres masr there was a trembling upon her that i can see now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coldness of her hand when i touched it i can feel yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its only sign of animation was to shrink from mine and then she glided from the chair and creeping to the other side of her uncle bowed herself silently and trembling still upon his breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty smoothing her rich hair with his great hard hand that it cant abear the sorrer of this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its natral in young folk masr davy when theyre new to she clung the closer to him but neither lifted up her face nor spoke a word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty and heres ham come fur to take you home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go along with tother loving the sound of her voice had not reached me but he bent his head as let you stay with your uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why you doent mean to ask me that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when your husband thatll be so soon is here fur to take you home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now a person wouldnt think it fur to see this little thing alongside a roughweather chap like me said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty looking round at both of us with infinite pride but the sea aint more salt in it than she has emlys in the right in that masr davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as emly wishes of it and as shes hurried and frightened no no said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you doent ought a married man like you or whats as good to take and hull away a days work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you doent ought to watch and work both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you aint afeerd of emly not being took good care on i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ham yielded to this persuasion and took his hat to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i never saw him approach her but i felt that nature had given him the soul of a gentleman she seemed to cling closer to her uncle even to the avoidance of her chosen husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shut the door after him that it might cause no disturbance of the quiet that prevailed and when i turned back i found mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now im a going upstairs to tell your aunt as masr davys here and thatll cheer her up a bit he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit ye down by the fire the while my dear and warm those mortal cold hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you doent need to be so fearsome and take on so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if her uncle was turned out of house and home and forced to lay down in a dyke masr davy said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty with no less pride than before its my belief shed go along with him now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but therell be afterwards when i went upstairs as i passed the door of my little chamber which was dark i had an indistinct impression of her being within it cast down upon the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but whether it was really she or whether it was a confusion of the shadows in the room i dont know now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had leisure to think before the kitchen fire of pretty little emilys dread of death which added to what mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer had told me i took to be the cause of her being so unlike herself and i had leisure before peggotty came down even to think more leniently of the weakness of it as i sat counting the ticking of the clock and deepening my sense of the solemn hush around me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty took me in her arms and blessed and thanked me over and over again for being such a comfort to her that was what she said in her distress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then entreated me to come upstairs sobbing that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barkis had always liked me and admired me that he had often talked of me before he fell into a stupor and that she believed in case of his coming to himself again he would brighten up at sight of me if he could brighten up at any earthly thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the probability of his ever doing so appeared to me when i saw him to be very small <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was lying with his head and shoulders out of bed in an uncomfortable attitude half resting on the box which had cost him so much pain and trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i learned that when he was past creeping out of bed to open it and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the divining rod i had seen him use he had required to have it placed on the chair at the bedside where he had ever since embraced it night and day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time and the world were slipping from beneath him but the box was there and the last words he had uttered were barkis my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said peggotty almost cheerfully bending over him while her brother and i stood at the beds foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres my dear boy my dear boy master davy who brought us together barkis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wont you speak to he was as mute and senseless as the box from which his form derived the only expression it had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a going out with the tide said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my eyes were dim and so were mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggottys but i repeated in a people cant die along the coast said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty except when the tides pretty nigh out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they cant be born unless its pretty nigh in not properly born till flood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its ebb at halfarter three slack water half an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he lives till it turns hell hold his own till past the we remained there watching him a long time hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what mysterious influence my presence had upon him in that state of his senses i shall not pretend to say but when he at last began to wander feebly it is certain he was muttering about driving me to school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty touched me and whispered with much awe and reverence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was on the point of asking him if he knew me when he tried to stretch out his arm and said to me distinctly with a pleasant and it being low water he went out with the tide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter it was not difficult for me on peggottys solicitation to resolve to stay where i was until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey to blunderstone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had long ago bought out of her own savings a little piece of ground in our old churchyard near the grave of her sweet girl as she always called my mother and there they were to rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in keeping peggotty company and doing all i could for her little enough at the utmost i was as grateful i rejoice to think as even now i could wish myself to have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am afraid i had a supreme satisfaction of a personal and professional nature in taking charge of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be looked for in the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after some search it was found in the box at the bottom of a horses nosebag wherein besides hay there was discovered an old gold watch with chain and seals which mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barkis had worn on his weddingday and which had never been seen before or since a silver tobaccostopper in the form of a leg an imitation lemon full of minute cups and saucers which i have some idea mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barkis must have purchased to present to me when i was a child and afterwards found himself unable to part with eightyseven guineas and a half in guineas and halfguineas two hundred and ten pounds in perfectly clean bank notes certain receipts for bank of england stock an old horseshoe a bad shilling a piece of camphor and an oystershell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the circumstance of the latter article having been much polished and displaying prismatic colours on the inside i conclude that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barkis had some general ideas about pearls which never resolved themselves into anything definite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barkis had carried this box on all his journeys every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it might the better escape notice he had invented a fiction that it belonged to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blackboy and was to be left with barkis till called for a fable he had elaborately written on the lid in characters now scarcely legible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had hoarded all these years i found to good purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of this he bequeathed the interest of one thousand to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty for his life on his decease the principal to be equally divided between peggotty little emily and me or the survivor or survivors of us share and share alike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the rest he died possessed of he bequeathed to peggotty whom he left residuary legatee and sole executrix of that his last will and testament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt myself quite a proctor when i read this document aloud with all possible ceremony and set forth its provisions any number of times to those whom they concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to think there was more in the commons than i had supposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i examined the will with the deepest attention pronounced it perfectly formal in all respects made a pencilmark or so in the margin and thought it rather extraordinary that i knew so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this abstruse pursuit in making an account for peggotty of all the property into which she had come in arranging all the affairs in an orderly manner and in being her referee and adviser on every point to our joint delight i passed the week before the funeral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not see little emily in that interval but they told me she was to be quietly married in a fortnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not attend the funeral in character if i may venture to say so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean i was not dressed up in a black coat and a streamer to frighten the birds but i walked over to blunderstone early in the morning and was in the churchyard when it came attended only by peggotty and her brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mad gentleman looked on out of my little window mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chillips baby wagged its heavy head and rolled its goggle eyes at the clergyman over its nurses shoulder mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> omer breathed short in the background no one else was there and it was very quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we walked about the churchyard for an hour after all was over and pulled some young leaves from the tree above my mothers grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cloud is lowering on the distant town towards which i retraced my solitary steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot bear to think of what did come upon that memorable night of what must come again if i go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is no worse because i write of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be no better if i stopped my most unwilling hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing can undo it nothing can make it otherwise than as it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my old nurse was to go to london with me next day on the business of the will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little emily was passing that day at mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were all to meet in the old boathouse that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ham would bring emily at the usual hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brother and sister would return as they had come and be expecting us when the day closed in at the fireside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i parted from them at the wicketgate where visionary strap had rested with roderick randoms knapsack in the days of yore and instead of going straight back walked a little distance on the road to lowestoft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i turned and walked back towards yarmouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stayed to dine at a decent alehouse some mile or two from the ferry i have mentioned before and thus the day wore away and it was evening when i reached it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rain was falling heavily by that time and it was a wild night but there was a moon behind the clouds and it was not dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggottys house and of the light within it shining through the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little floundering across the sand which was heavy brought me to the door and i went in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty had smoked his evening pipe and there were preparations for some supper by and by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fire was bright the ashes were thrown up the locker was ready for little emily in her old place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in her own old place sat peggotty once more looking but for her dress as if she had never left it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had fallen back already on the society of the workbox with st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauls upon the lid the yardmeasure in the cottage and the bit of waxcandle and there they all were just as if they had never been disturbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gummidge appeared to be fretting a little in her old corner and consequently looked quite natural too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peggotty said i giving him my outer coat to hang so tis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it aint o no use saying welcome to you but thank you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after tea we thawed down into commonlife subjects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were thankful to lady glenmire for having proposed some more bread and butter and this mutual want made us better acquainted with her than we should ever have been with talking about the court though miss pole did say she had hoped to know how the dear queen was from some one who had seen her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the friendship begun over bread and butter extended on to cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lady glenmire played preference to admiration and was a complete authority as to ombre and quadrille <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even miss pole quite forgot to say my lady and your ladyship and said basto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maam you have spadille i believe just as quietly as if we had never held the great cranford parliament on the subject of the proper mode of addressing a peeress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a proof of how thoroughly we had forgotten that we were in the presence of one who might have sat down to tea with a coronet instead of a cap on her head mrs forrester related a curious little fact to lady glenmire an anecdote known to the circle of her intimate friends but of which even mrs jamieson was not aware <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it related to some fine old lace the sole relic of better days which lady glenmire was admiring on mrs forresters collar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said that lady such lace cannot be got now for either love or money made by the nuns abroad they tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say that they cant make it now even there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but perhaps they can now theyve passed the catholic emancipation bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the meantime i treasure up my lace very much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i darent even trust the washing of it to my maid the little charity schoolgirl i have named before but who sounded well as my maid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course your ladyship knows that such lace must never be starched or ironed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some people wash it in sugar and water and some in coffee to make it the right yellow colour but i myself have a very good receipt for washing it in milk which stiffens it enough and gives it a very good creamy colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well maam i had tacked it together and the beauty of this fine lace is that when it is wet it goes into a very little space and put it to soak in milk when unfortunately i left the room on my return i found pussy on the table looking very like a thief but gulping very uncomfortably as if she was halfchocked with something she wanted to swallow and could not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first i pitied her and said poor pussy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> till all at once i looked and saw the cup of milk empty cleaned out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i and i believe i was provoked enough to give her a slap which did no good but only helped the lace down just as one slaps a choking child on the back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could have cried i was so vexed but i determined i would not give the lace up without a struggle for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hoped the lace might disagree with her at any rate but it would have been too much for job if he had seen as i did that cat come in quite placid and purring not a quarter of an hour after and almost expecting to be stroked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i if you have any conscience you ought not to expect that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then a thought struck me and i rang the bell for my maid and sent her to mr hoggins with my compliments and would he be kind enough to lend me one of his topboots for an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not think there was anything odd in the message but jenny said the young men in the surgery laughed as if they would be ill at my wanting a topboot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it came jenny and i put pussy in with her forefeet straight down so that they were fastened and could not scratch and we gave her a teaspoonful of currentjelly in which your ladyship must excuse me i had mixed some tartar emetic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall never forget how anxious i was for the next half hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took pussy to my own room and spread a clean towel on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could have kissed her when she returned the lace to sight very much as it had gone down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jenny had boiling water ready and we soaked it and soaked it and spread it on a lavender bush in the sun before i could touch it again even to put it in milk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now your ladyship would never guess that it had been in pussys inside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found out in the course of the evening that lady glenmire was going to pay mrs jamieson a long visit as she had given up her apartments in edinburgh and had no ties to take her back there in a hurry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the whole we were rather glad to hear this for she had made a pleasant impression upon us and it was also very comfortable to find from things which dropped out in the course of conversation that in addition to many other genteel qualities she was far removed from the vulgarity of wealth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked mrs jamieson as our respective servants were announced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a pretty regular question from mrs jamieson who had her own carriage in the coach house and always went out in a sedanchair to the very shortest distances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answers were nearly as much a matter of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is so pleasant and still at night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a refreshment after the excitement of a party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not very replied miss matty rather confused at the moment to remember which was astronomy and which was astrology but the answer was true under either circumstance for she read and was slightly alarmed at francis moores astrological predictions and as to astronomy in a private and confidential conversation she had told me she never could believe that the earth was moving constantly and that she would not believe it if she could it made her feel so tired and dizzy whenever she thought about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in our pattens we picked our way home with extra care that night so refined and delicate were our perceptions after drinking tea with my lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon after the events of which i gave an account in my last paper i was summoned home by my fathers illness and for a time i forgot in anxiety about him to wonder how my dear friends at cranford were getting on or how lady glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness of the long visit which she was still paying to her sisterinlaw mrs jamieson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when my father grew a little stronger i accompanied him to the seaside so that altogether i seemed banished from cranford and was deprived of the opportunity of hearing any chance intelligence of the dear little town for the greater part of that year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what to say miss said liddy beginning to cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i say no you dont believe me and if i say yes you rage at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say you dont believe it say you dont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe him to be so had as they make out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my poor life and heart how weak i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she moaned in a relaxed desultory way heedless of liddys presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how i wish i had never seen him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall never forgive god for making me a woman and dearly am i beginning to pay for the honour of owning a pretty face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mind this lydia smallbury if you repeat anywhere a single word of what i have said to you inside this closed door ill never trust you or love you or have you with me a moment longer not a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to repeat anything said liddy with womanly dignity of a diminutive order but i dont wish to stay with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you please ill go at the end of the harvest or this week or today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see that i deserve to be put upon and stormed at for nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said bathsheba dropping from haughtiness to entreaty with capricious inconsequence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must not notice my being in a taking just now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not as a servant you are a companion to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear dear i dont know what i am doing since this miserable ache o <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my heart has weighted and worn upon me so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i shall get further and further into troubles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder sometimes if i am doomed to die in the union <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont notice anything nor will i leave you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sobbed liddy impulsively putting up her lips to bathshebas and kissing her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then bathsheba kissed liddy and all was smooth again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you have made tears come into my eyes she said a smile shining through the moisture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> try to think him a good man wont you dear liddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a sort of steady man in a wild way you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats better than to be as some are wild in a steady way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and promise me to keep my secret do liddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and do not let them know that i have been crying about him because it will be dreadful for me and no good to him poor thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deaths head himself shant wring it from me mistress if ive a mind to keep anything and ill always be your friend replied liddy emphatically at the same time bringing a few more tears into her own eyes not from any particular necessity but from an artistic sense of making herself in keeping with the remainder of the picture which seems to influence women at such times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think god likes us to be good friends dont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dear miss you wont harry me and storm at me will you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because you seem to swell so tall as a lion then and it frightens me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know i fancy you would be a match for any man when you are in one o your takings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said bathsheba slightly laughing though somewhat seriously alarmed by this amazonian picture of herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope i am not a bold sort of maid mannish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no not mannish but so almighty womanish that tis getting on that way sometimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss she said after having drawn her breath very sadly in and sent it very sadly out i wish i had half your failing that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis a great protection to a poor maid in these illegitmate days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next evening bathsheba with the idea of getting out of the way of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boldwood in the event of his returning to answer her note in person proceeded to fulfil an engagement made with liddy some few hours earlier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bathshebas companion as a gage of their reconciliation had been granted a weeks holiday to visit her sister who was married to a thriving hurdler and cattlecribmaker living in a delightful labyrinth of hazel copse not far beyond yalbury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the arrangement was that miss everdene should honour them by coming there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious contrivances which this man of the woods had introduced into his wares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leaving her instructions with gabriel and maryann that they were to see everything carefully locked up for the night she went out of the house just at the close of a timely thundershower which had refined the air and daintily bathed the coat of the land though all beneath was dry as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freshness was exhaled in an essence from the varied contours of bank and hollow as if the earth breathed maiden breath and the pleased birds were hymning to the scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before her among the clouds there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of fierce light which showed themselves in the neighbourhood of a hidden sun lingering on to the farthest northwest corner of the heavens that this midsummer season allowed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had walked nearly two miles of her journey watching how the day was retreating and thinking how the time of deeds was quietly melting into the time of thought to give place in its turn to the time of prayer and sleep when she beheld advancing over yalbury hill the very man she sought so anxiously to elude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boldwood was stepping on not with that quiet tread of reserved strength which was his customary gait in which he always seemed to be balancing two thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boldwood had for the first time been awakened to womans privileges in tergiversation even when it involves another persons possible blight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that bathsheba was a firm and positive girl far less inconsequent than her fellows had been the very lung of his hope for he had held that these qualities would lead her to adhere to a straight course for consistencys sake and accept him though her fancy might not flood him with the iridescent hues of uncritical love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the argument now came back as sorry gleams from a broken mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the discovery was no less a scourge than a surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came on looking upon the ground and did not see bathsheba till they were less than a stones throw apart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked up at the sound of her pitpat and his changed appearance sufficiently denoted to her the depth and strength of the feelings paralyzed by her letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she faltered a guilty warmth pulsing in her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who have the power of reproaching in silence may find it a means more effective than words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are accents in the eye which are not on the tongue and more tales come from pale lips than can enter an ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter moods that they avoid the pathway of sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing she turned a little aside he said what are you afraid of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it is most strange because of its contrast with my feeling for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she regained selfpossession fixed her eyes calmly and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know what that feeling is continued boldwood deliberately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no dismissal by a hasty letter affects that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you did not feel so strongly about me she murmured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is generous of you and more than i deserve but i must not hear it now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think i have to say then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not to marry you and thats enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to hear nothing not i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bathsheba was unable to direct her will into any definite groove for freeing herself from this fearfully and was moving on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boldwood walked up to her heavily and dully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gods sake yes i am come to that low lowest stage to ask a woman for pity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she could hardly get a clear voice for what came instinctively to her lips there is little honour to the woman in that speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only whispered for something unutterably mournful no less than distressing in this spectacle of a man showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a passion enervated the feminine instinct for punctilios <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am beyond myself about this and am mad he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am no stoic at all to he supplicating here but i do supplicate to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you knew what is in me of devotion to you but it is impossible that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in bare human mercy to a lonely man dont throw me off now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont throw you off indeed how can i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in her noonclear sense that she had never loved him she forgot for a moment her thoughtless angle on that day in february <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was a time when you turned to me before i thought of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont reproach you for even now i feel that the ignorant and cold darkness that i should have lived in if you had not attracted me by that letter valentine you call it would have been worse than my knowledge of you though it has brought this misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i say there was a time when i knew nothing of you and cared nothing for you and yet you drew me on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you say you gave me no encouragement i cannot but contradict you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what you call encouragement was the childish game of an idle minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have bitterly repented of it ay bitterly and in tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont accuse you of it i deplore it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took for earnest what you insist was jest and now this that i pray to be jest you say is awful wretched earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish your feeling was more like mine or my feeling more like yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh could i but have foreseen the torture that trifling trick was going to lead me into how i should have cursed you but only having been able to see it since i cannot do that for i love you too well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is weak idle drivelling to go on like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bathsheba you are the first woman of any shade or nature that i have ever looked at to love and it is the having been so near claiming you for my own that makes this denial so hard to bear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont speak now to move your heart and make you grieve because of my pain it is no use that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must bear it my pain would get no less by paining you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i do pity you deeply o so deeply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do no such thing do no such thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your dear love bathsheba is such a vast thing beside your pity that the loss of your pity as well as your love is no great addition to my sorrow nor does the gain of your pity make it sensibly less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o sweet how dearly you spoke to me behind the spearbed at the washingpool and in the barn at the shearing and that dearest last time in the evening at your home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where are your pleasant words all gone your earnest hope to be able to love me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where is your firm conviction that you would get to care for me very much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she checked emotion looked him quietly and clearly in the face and said in her low firm voice mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you have had me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest highest compliment a man can pay a woman telling her he loves her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was bound to show some feeling if l would not be a graceless shrew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet each of those pleasures was just for the day the day just for the pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how was i to know that what is a pastime to all other men was death to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have reason do and think more kindly of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing is sure you were all but mine and now you are not nearly mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything is changed and that by you alone remember <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were nothing to me once and i was contented you are now nothing to me again and how different the second nothing is from the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would to god you had never taken me up since it was only to throw me down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bathsheba in spite of her mettle began to feel un mistakable signs that she was inherently the weaker vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she strove miserably against this feminity which would insist upon supplying unbidden emotions in stronger and stronger current <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had tried to elude agitation by fixing her mind on the trees sky any trivial object before her eyes whilst his reproaches fell but ingenuity could not save her now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not take you up surely i did not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dont be in this mood with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can endure being told i am in the wrong if you will only tell it me gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o sir will you not kindly forgive me and look at it cheerfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can a man fooled to utter heartburning find a reason for being merry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i have lost how can i be as if i had won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had i known what a fearfully bitter sweet this was to be how would i have avoided you and never seen you and been deaf of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you all this but what do you care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she returned silent and weak denials to his charges and swayed her head desperately as if to thrust away the words as they came showering about her ears from the lips of the trembling man in the climax of life with his bronzed roman face and fine frame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dearest dearest i am wavering even now between the two opposites of recklessly renouncing you and labouring humbly for you again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forget that you have said no and let it be as it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say bathsheba that you only wrote that refusal to me in fun come say it to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be untrue and painful to both of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont possess half the warmth of nature you believe me to have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an unprotected childhood in a cold world has beaten gentleness out of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he immediately said with more resentment that may be true somewhat but ah miss everdene it wont do as a reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not the cold woman you would have me believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt because you have no feeling in you that you dont love me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you naturally would have me think so you would hide from me that you have a burning heart like mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have love enough but it is turned into a new channel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the swift music of her heart became hubbub now and she throbbed to extremity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the name fell from his lips the next moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did troy not leave my treasure alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i had no thought of injuring him why did he force himself upon your notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before he worried you your inclination was to have me when next i should have come to you your answer would have been yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you deny it i ask can you deny it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she delayed the reply but was to honest to with hold it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well then i said this shall be mine to arrange <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind is in the east my road lies westward keep your boat i hire it let us work up the forth all day and land me at two oclock tomorrow at the westmost well can have reached <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried ye would try for inverary after a <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i was a kind o sorry for ye a day yesterday he added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye see i was never entirely sure till then which way of it ye really wantit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was a spur to a lame horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a word in your ear andie said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this plan of mine has another advantage yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can leave these hielandman behind us on the rock and one of your boats from the castleton can bring them off tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yon neil has a queer eye when he regards you maybe if i was once out of the gate there might be knives again these redshanks are unco grudgeful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if there should come to be any question here is your excuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our lives were in danger by these savages being answerable for my safety you chose the part to bring me from their neighbourhood and detain me the rest of the time on board your boat and do you know andie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says i with a smile i think it was very wisely chosen the truth is i have nae goo for neil says andie nor he for me im thinking and i would like ill to come to my hands wi the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tam anster will make a better hand of it with the cattle onyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this man anster came from fife where the gaelic is still spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says andie tamll can deal with them the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mair i think of it the less i see we would be required <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eh shaws yere a langheided chield when ye like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forby that im awing ye my life he added with more solemnity and offered me his hand upon the bargain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon with scarce more words we stepped suddenly on board the boat cast off and set the lug <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gregara were then busy upon breakfast for the cookery was their usual part but one of them stepping to the battlements our flight was observed before we were twenty fathoms from the rock and the three of them ran about the ruins and the landingshelf for all the world like ants about a broken nest hailing and crying on us to return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were still in both the lee and the shadow of the rock which last lay broad upon the waters but presently came forth in almost the same moment into the wind and sunshine the sail filled the boat heeled to the gunwale and we swept immediately beyond sound of the mens voices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to what terrors they endured upon the rock where they were now deserted without the countenance of any civilised person or so much as the protection of a bible no limit can be set nor had they any brandy left to be their consolation for even in the haste and secrecy of our departure andie had managed to remove it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was our first care to set anster ashore in a cove by the glenteithy rocks so that the deliverance of our maroons might be duly seen to the next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the breeze which was then so spirited swiftly declined but never wholly failed us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all day we kept moving though often not much more and it was after dark ere we were up with the queensferry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to keep the letter of andies engagement or what was left of it i must remain on board but i thought no harm to communicate with the shore in writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on prestongranges cover where the government seal must have a good deal surprised my correspondent i writ by the boats lantern a few necessary words aboard and andie carried them to rankeillor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in about an hour he came again with a purse of money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing saddled for me by two tomorrow at clackmannan pool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this done and the boat riding by her stone anchor we lay down to sleep under the sail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in the pool the next day long ere two and there was nothing left for me but to sit and wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would have been glad of any passable excuse to lay it down but none being to be found my uneasiness was no less great than if i had been running to some desired pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by shortly after one the horse was at the waterside and i could see a man walking it to and fro till i should land which vastly swelled my impatience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> andie ran the moment of my liberation very fine showing himself a man of his bare word but scarce serving his employers with a heaped measure and by about fifty seconds after two i was in the saddle and on the full stretch for stirling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a little more than an hour i had passed that town and was already mounting alan water side when the weather broke in a small tempest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rain blinded me the wind had nearly beat me from the saddle and the first darkness of the night surprised me in a wilderness still some way east of balwhidder not very sure of my direction and mounted on a horse that began already to be weary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the press of my hurry and to be spared the delay and annoyance of a guide i had followed so far as it was possible for any horseman the line of my journey with alan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i did with open eyes foreseeing a great risk in it which the tempest had now brought to a reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last that i knew of where i was i think it must have been about uam var the hour perhaps six at night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must still think it great good fortune that i got about eleven to my destination the house of duncan dhu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where i had wandered in the interval perhaps the horse could tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know we were twice down and once over the saddle and for a moment carried away in a roaring burn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steed and rider were bemired up to the eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from duncan i had news of the trial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was followed in all these highland regions with religious interest news of it spread from inverary as swift as men could travel and i was rejoiced to learn that up to a late hour that saturday it was not yet concluded and all men began to suppose it must spread over the monday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under the spur of this intelligence i would not sit to eat but duncan having agreed to be my guide took the road again on foot with the piece in my hand and munching as i went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> duncan brought with him a flask of usquebaugh and a handlantern which last enlightened us just so long as we could find houses where to rekindle it for the thing leaked outrageously and blew out with every gust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more part of the night we walked blindfold among sheets of rain and day found us aimless on the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hard by we struck a hut on a burnside where we got bite and a direction and a little before the end of the sermon came to the kirk doors of inverary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me but i was still bogged as high as to the knees i streamed water i was so weary i could hardly limp and my face was like a ghosts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood certainly more in need of a change of raiment and a bed to lie on than of all the benefits in christianity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all which being persuaded the chief point for me was to make myself immediately public i set the door of the church with the dirty duncan at my tails and finding a vacant place sat down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thirteently my brethren and in parenthesis the law itself must be regarded as a means of grace the minister was saying in the voice of one delighting to pursue an argument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sermon was in english on account of the assize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judges were present with their armed attendants the halberts glittered in a corner by the door and the seats were thronged beyond custom with the array of lawyers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the text was in romans th and th the minister a skilled hand and the whole of that able churchful from argyle and my lords elchies and kilkerran down to the halbertmen that came in their attendance was sunk with gathered brows in a profound critical attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the minister himself and a sprinkling of those about the door observed our entrance at the moment and immediately forgot the same the rest either did not hear or would not hear or would not be heard and i sat amongst my friends and enemies unremarked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first that i singled out was prestongrange <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat well forward like an eager horseman in the saddle his lips moving with relish his eyes glued on the minister the doctrine was clearly to his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charles stewart on the other hand was half asleep and looked harassed and pale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for simon fraser he appeared like a blot and almost a scandal in the midst of that attentive congregation digging his hands in his pockets shifting his legs clearing his throat and rolling up his bald eyebrows and shooting out his eyes to right and left now with a yawn now with a secret smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times too he would take the bible in front of him run it through seem to read a bit run it through again and stop and yawn prodigiously the whole as if for exercise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat a second stupefied then tore a halfleaf out of the bible scrawled upon it with a pencil and passed it with a whispered word to his next neighbour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the note came to prestongrange who gave me but the one look thence it voyaged to the hands of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> erskine thence again to argyle where he sat between the other two lords of session and his grace turned and fixed me with an arrogant eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last of those interested in my presence was charlie stewart and he too began to pencil and hand about dispatches none of which i was able to trace to their destination in the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the passage of these notes had aroused notice all who were in the secret or supposed themselves to be so were whispering information the rest questions and the minister himself seemed quite discountenanced by the flutter in the church and sudden stir and whispering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his voice changed he plainly faltered nor did he again recover the easy conviction and full tones of his delivery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be a puzzle to him till his dying day why a sermon that had gone with triumph through four parts should this miscarry in the fifth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for me i continued to sit there very wet and weary and a good deal anxious as to what should happen next but greatly exulting in my success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last word of the blessing was scarce out of the ministers mouth before stewart had me by the arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were the first to be forth of the church and he made such extraordinary expedition that we were safe within the four walls of a house before the street had begun to be thronged with the homegoing congregation <end> <end>

<start> <start> after a little further conference jasper agreed to do what wa rodney was considerably surprised one evening to receive a cal from jasper in his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was alone as mike had bee detailed about a week ago for night duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rodney had bought a writing desk which stood in the corner and had put up three pictures which good evening jasper he said <end> <end>

<start> <start> you look quite comfortable here continued jasper in we try to be comfortable though our room is not luxurious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont seem to very particular said jasper shruggin i am very particular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet you room with an irish telegraph boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a nice boy of good habit and a devoted friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well you have a right to consult your own taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he has a good house but i am no so independent as if i had a room outide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how are things going on at the store <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for two reasons i am occupied during the day and i dont wan to go where i am considered a thief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is hard to get along o seven dollars a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still you have a nice home and i suppose you have most of you salary to yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but there isnt much margin in seven dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncl expects me to buy my own clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were lucky to get out o the store <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old goodnow ought to give me ten dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont let him hear you speak of him as old goodnow jasper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres another repeated brass and if i could get a break and four blood horses to cut into the marks when the crowd is at its the distant squeak was heard again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ran violently down the stairs out into the street and so past the window without any hat towards the quarter whence the sound proceededbent no doubt upon securing the strangers services directly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i only knew who his friends were muttered sampson filling his pocket with papers if theyd just get up a pretty little commission de lunatico at the grays inn coffee house and give me the job id be content to have the lodgings empty for one with which words and knocking his hat over his eyes as if for the purpose of shutting out even a glimpse of the dreadful visitation mr brass rushed from the house and hurried away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as mr swiveller was decidedly favourable to these performances upon the ground that looking at a punch or indeed looking at anything out of window was better than working and as he had been for this reason at some pains to awaken in his fellow clerk a sense of their beauties and manifold deserts both he and miss sally rose as with one accord and took up their positions at the window upon the sill whereof as in a post of honour sundry young ladies and gentlemen who were employed in the dry nurture of babies and who made a point of being present with their young charges on such occasions had already established themselves as comfortably as the circumstances would allow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the glass being dim mr swiveller agreeably to a friendly custom which he had established between them hitched off the brown headdress from miss sallys head and dusted it carefully therewith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time he had handed it back and its beautiful wearer had put it on again which she did with perfect composure and indifference the lodger returned with the show and showmen at his heels and a strong addition to the body of spectators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the exhibitor disappeared with all speed behind the drapery and his partner stationing himself by the side of the theatre surveyed the audience with a remarkable expression of melancholy which became more remarkable still when he breathed a hornpipe tune into that sweet musical instrument which is popularly termed a mouthorgan without at all changing the mournful expression of the upper part of his face though his mouth and chin were of necessity in lively spasms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the drama proceeded to its close and held the spectators enchained in the customary manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sensation which kindles in large assemblies when they are relieved from a state of breathless suspense and are again free to speak and move was yet rife when the lodger as usual summoned the men up stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both of you he called from the window for only the actual exhibitora little fat manprepared to obey the summons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what should i dont you see the gentlemans got a bottle and glass up there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and couldnt you have said so at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you going to with this remonstrance the melancholy man who was no other than mr thomas codlin pushed past his friend and brother in the craft mr harris otherwise short or trotters and hurried before him to the single gentlemans apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now my men said the single gentleman you have done very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell that little man behind to shut the shut the door cant you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said mr codlin turning gruffly to his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might have knowed that the gentleman wanted the door mr short obeyed observing under his breath that his friend seemed unusually cranky and expressing a hope that there was no dairy in the neighbourhood or his temper would certainly spoil its contents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gentleman pointed to a couple of chairs and intimated by an emphatic nod of his head that he expected them to be seated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> messrs codlin and short after looking at each other with considerable doubt and indecision at length sat downeach on the extreme edge of the chair pointed out to himand held their hats very tight while the single gentleman filled a couple of glasses from a bottle on the table beside him and presented them in due form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre pretty well browned by the sun both of you said their mr short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr codlin added a corroborative nod and a short groan as if he still felt the weight of the temple on his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to fairs markets races and so forth i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes sir returned short pretty nigh all over the west of i have talked to men of your craft from north east and south returned their host in rather a hasty manner but i never lighted its our reglar summer circuit is the west master said short thats where it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we takes the east of london in the spring and winter and the west of england in the summer time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> manys the hard days walking in rain and mud and with never a penny earned much obleeged to you sir i think i will said mr codlin suddenly thrusting in his own and turning shorts aside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im the sufferer sir in all the travelling and in all the staying at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in town or country wet or dry hot or cold tom codlin suffers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tom codlin isnt to complain for all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> short may complain but if codlin grumbles by so much as a word oh dear down with him down with him directly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt his place codlin ant without his usefulness observed short with an arch look but he dont always keep his eyes open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he falls asleep will you never leave off aggravating a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its very like i was asleep when fiveandtenpence was collected in one round isnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was attending to my business and couldnt have my eyes in twenty places at once like a peacock no more than you could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i ant a match for an old man and a young child you ant neither so dont throw that out against me for the cap fits your head quite as correct as it fits mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may as well drop the subject tom said short <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt then you shouldnt have brought it up returned mr codlin and i ask the gentlemans pardon on your account as a giddy chap that likes to hear himself talk and dont much care what he talks their entertainer had sat perfectly quiet in the beginning of this dispute looking first at one man and then at the other as if he were lying in wait for an opportunity of putting some further question or reverting to that from which the discourse had strayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but from the point where mr codlin was charged with sleepiness he had shown an increasing interest in the discussion which now attained a very high pitch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are the two men i want he said the two men i have been looking for and searching after <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where are that old man and that sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said short hesitating and looking towards his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man and his grandchild who travelled with youwhere are they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be worth your while to speak out i assure you much better worth your while than you believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they left you you say at those races as i understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have been traced to that place and there lost sight of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you no clue can you suggest did i always say thomas cried short turning with a look of amazement to his friend that there was sure to be an inquiry you said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did i always say that that ere blessed child was the most interesting i ever see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did i always say i loved her and doated on her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pretty creetur i think i hear her now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> codlins my friend she says with a tear of gratitude a trickling down her little eye codlins my friend she says not short <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shorts very well she says ive no quarrel with short he means kind i dare say but codlin she says has the repeating these words with great emotion mr codlin rubbed the bridge of his nose with his coatsleeve and shaking his head mournfully from side to side left the single gentleman to infer that from the moment when he lost sight of his dear young charge his peace of mind and happiness had fled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the single gentleman pacing up and down the room have i found these men at last only to discover that they can give me no information or assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have been better to have lived on in hope from day to day and never to stay a minute said short <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man of the name of jerryyou oh dont talk to me of jerrys replied mr codlin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can i care a pinch of snuff for jerrys when i think of that ere darling child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> codlins my friend she says dear good kind codlin as is always a devising pleasures for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont object to short she says but i cotton to codlin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once said that gentleman reflectively she called me father codlin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i a man of the name of jerry sir said short turning from his selfish colleague to their new acquaintance wot keeps a company of dancing dogs told me in a accidental sort of way that he had seen the old gentleman in connexion with a travelling waxwork unbeknown to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as theyd given us the slip and nothing had come of it and this was down in the country that hed been seen i took no measures about it and asked no questionsbut i can if is this man in town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speak no he isnt but he will be tomorrow for he lodges in our house replied mr short rapidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then bring him here said the single gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i can find these people through your means it is but a prelude to twenty more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> return to me tomorrow and keep your own counsel on this subjectthough i need hardly tell you that for youll do so for your own sakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now give me your the address was given the two men departed the crowd went with them and the single gentleman for two mortal hours walked in uncommon agitation up and down his room over the wondering heads of mr swiveller and miss sally brass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kitfor it happens at this juncture not only that we have breathing time to follow his fortunes but that the necessities of these adventures so adapt themselves to our ease and inclination as to call upon us imperatively to pursue the track we most desire to takekit while the matters treated of in the last fifteen chapters were yet in progress was as the reader may suppose gradually familiarising himself more and more with mr and mrs garland mr abel the pony and barbara and gradually coming to consider them one and all as his particular private friends and abel cottage finchley as his own proper home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> staythe words are written and may go but if they convey any notion that kit in the plentiful board and comfortable lodging of his new abode began to think slightingly of the poor fare and furniture of his old dwelling they do their office badly and commit injustice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who so mindful of those he left at homealbeit they were but a mother and two young babiesas kit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what boastful father in the fulness of his heart ever related such wonders of his infant prodigy as kit never wearied of telling barbara in the evening time concerning little jacob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was there ever such a mother as kits mother on her sons showing or was there ever such comfort in poverty as in the poverty of kits family if any correct judgment might be arrived at from his own glowing account <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and let me linger in this place for an instant to remark that if ever household affections and loves are graceful things they are graceful in the poor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ties that bind the wealthy and the proud to home may be forged on earth but those which link the poor man to his humble hearth are of the truer metal and bear the stamp of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man of high descent may love the halls and lands of his inheritance as part of himself as trophies of his birth and power his associations with them are associations of pride and wealth and triumph the poor mans attachment to the tenements he holds which strangers have held before and may tomorrow occupy again has a worthier root struck deep into a purer soil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his household gods are of flesh and blood with no alloy of silver gold or precious stone he has no property but in the affections of his own heart and when they endear bare floors and walls despite of rags and toil and scanty fare that man has his love of home from god and his rude hut becomes a solemn place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if those who rule the destinies of nations would but remember thisif they would but think how hard it is for the very poor to have engendered in their hearts that love of home from which all domestic virtues spring when they live in dense and squalid masses where social decency is lost or rather never foundif they would but turn aside from the wide thoroughfares and great houses and strive to improve the wretched dwellings in byeways where only poverty may walkmany low roofs would point more truly to the sky than the loftiest steeple that now rears proudly up from the midst of guilt and crime and horrible disease to mock them by its contrast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in hollow voices from workhouse hospital and jail this truth is preached from day to day and has been proclaimed for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is no light matterno outcry from the working vulgar no mere question of the peoples health and comforts that may be whistled down on wednesday nights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in love of home the love of country has its rise and who are the truer patriots or the better in time of needthose who venerate the land owning its wood and stream and earth and all that they produce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or those who love their country boasting not a foot of ground in all its wide domain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kit knew nothing about such questions but he knew that his old home was a very poor place and that his new one was very unlike it and yet he was constantly looking back with grateful satisfaction and affectionate anxiety and often indited square folded letters to his mother enclosing a shilling or eighteenpence or such other small remittance which mr abels liberality enabled him to make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes being in the neighbourhood he had leisure to call upon her and then great was the joy and pride of kits mother and extremely noisy the satisfaction of little jacob and the baby and cordial the congratulations of the whole court who listened with admiring ears to the accounts of abel cottage and could never be told too much of its wonders and magnificence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although kit was in the very highest favour with the old lady and gentleman and mr abel and barbara it is certain that no member of the family evinced such a remarkable partiality for him as the selfwilled pony who from being the most obstinate and opinionated pony on the face of the earth was in his hands the meekest and most tractable of animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true that in exact proportion as he became manageable by kit he became utterly ungovernable by anybody else as if he had determined to keep him in the family at all risks and hazards and that even under the guidance of his favourite he would sometimes perform a great variety of strange freaks and capers to the extreme discomposure of the old ladys nerves but as kit always represented that this was only his fun or a way he had of showing his attachment to his employers mrs garland gradually suffered herself to be persuaded into the belief in which she at last became so strongly confirmed that if in one of these ebullitions he had overturned the chaise she would have been quite satisfied that he did it with the very best intentions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides becoming in a short time a perfect marvel in all stable matters kit soon made himself a very tolerable gardener a handy fellow within doors and an indispensable attendant on mr abel who every day gave him some new proof of his confidence and approbation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr witherden the notary too regarded him with a friendly eye and even mr chuckster would sometimes condescend to give him a slight nod or to honour him with that peculiar form of recognition which is called taking a sight or to favour him with some other salute combining pleasantry with patronage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one morning kit drove mr abel to the notarys office as he sometimes did and having set him down at the house was about to drive off to a livery stable hard by when this same mr chuckster emerged from the office door and cried woaaaaaa!dwelling upon the note a long time for the purpose of striking terror into the ponys heart and asserting the supremacy of man over the inferior animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pull up snobby cried mr chuckster addressing himself to kit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ask no questions snobby returned mr chuckster but go and see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must be very gentle with him if you please said kit or youll find him troublesome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd better not keep on pulling his to this remonstrance mr chuckster deigned no other answer than addressing kit with a lofty and distant air as young feller and requesting him to cut and come again with all speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young feller complying mr chuckster put his hands in his pockets and tried to look as if he were not minding the pony but happened to be lounging there by accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kit scraped his shoes very carefully for he had not yet lost his reverence for the bundles of papers and the tin boxes and tapped at the officedoor which was quickly opened by the notary himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked an elderly gentleman but of a stout bluff figurewho was in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell in with my client mr garland sir at this very door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have reason to think he is a good lad sir and that you may believe what he says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me introduce mr abel garland sirhis young master my articled pupil sir and most particular friendmy most particular friend sir repeated the notary drawing out his silk handkerchief and flourishing it about his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yours sir im sure replied mr abel mildly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were wishing my business is no secret or i should rather say it need be no secret here said the stranger observing that mr abel and the notary were preparing to retire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it relates to a dealer in curiosities with whom he lived and in whom i am earnestly and warmly interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been a stranger to this country gentlemen for very many years and if i am deficient in form and no forgiveness is necessary sirnone whatever replied the notary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been making inquiries in the neighbourhood in which his old master lived said the stranger and i learn that he was served by this lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have found out his mothers house and have been directed by her to this place as the nearest in which i should be likely to find him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the cause of my presenting myself here i am very glad of any cause sir said the notary which sir retorted the stranger you speak like a mere man of the world and i think you something better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore pray do not and a plain dealer returned the stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be my long absence and inexperience that lead me to the conclusion but if plain speakers are scarce in this part of the world i fancy plain dealers are still scarcer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if my speaking should offend you sir mr witherden seemed a little disconcerted by the elderly gentlemans mode of conducting the dialogue and as for kit he looked at him in openmouthed astonishment wondering what kind of language he would address to him if he talked in that free and easy way to a notary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with no harshness however though with something of constitutional irritability and haste that he if you think my lad that i am pursuing these inquiries with any other view than that of serving and reclaiming those i am in search of you do me a very great wrong and deceive yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if however he determined to wait a little before reminding miss miller of his claims to her consideration he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these friends was an american lady who had spent several winters at geneva where she had placed her children at school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a very accomplished woman and she lived in the via gregoriana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> winterbourne found her in a little crimson drawing room on a third floor the room was filled with southern sunshine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in announcing madame mila <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this announcement was presently followed by the entrance of little randolph miller who stopped in the middle of the room and stood staring at winterbourne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold and then after a considerable interval mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure you know a great many things exclaimed winterbourne taking him by the hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess but when she heard winterbournes voice she quickly turned her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you i should come you know winterbourne rejoined smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i didnt believe it said miss daisy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am much obliged to you laughed the young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother but this lady evaded his glance and seating herself fixed her eyes upon her son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve got a bigger place than this said randolph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you if i were to bring you you would say something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added jocosely giving winterbourne a thump on the knee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told them soldiers rojas was holdin thornetorturin him to make him tell where mercedes was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told about mercedeshow sweet an beautiful she washow her father had been murdered by rojashow she had been hounded by the bandithow ill an miserable she was waitin for her lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an she begged the cavalrymen to rescue thorne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the way it was told to me i reckon them cavalrymen went up in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fine fiery lot of young bloods i thought achin for a scrap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the officer in charge bein in a ticklish place still held out for higher orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youall know nells tongue is sometimes like a choya thorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id have give somethin to see her work up that soldier outfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nells never so pretty as when shes mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an this last stunt of hers was no girly tantrum as beldin calls it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she musta been ragin with all the hell theres in a woman....cant you fellers see her on blanco sol with her eyes turnin black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ladd mopped his sweaty face with his dusty scarf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was growing excited hurried in his narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right out then nell swore shed go after thorne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if them cavalrymen couldnt ride with a western girl to save a brother americanlet them hang back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one feller under orders tried to stop blanco sol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an that feller invited himself to the hospital <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the cavalrymen went flyin for their hosses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im thinkin as she felt then shed have sent blanco sol straight into rojass camp which id forgot to say was in plain sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it didnt take long for every cavalryman in that camp to get wind of what was comin off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they strung out after nell in a thunderin troop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say i wish you fellers could see the lane that bunch of hosses left in the greasewood an cactus <end> <end>

<start> <start> i never had grief that d hold a candle to this one of bein too late to see nell an sol in their one best race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rojas an his men vamoosed without a shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cavalrymen soon found thorne an hurried with him back on uncle sams land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorne was half naked black an blue all over thin as a rail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked mighty sick when i seen him first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he picked up wonderful an by the time jim came along he was wantin to start for forlorn river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by main strength as much as persuasion we kept the two of them quiet till next evenin at dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well we made as sneaky a start in the dark as jim an me could manage an never hit the trail till we was miles from town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thornes nerve held him up for a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then all at once he tumbled out of his saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got him back an lash held him on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as ladd paused in his story belding began to stutter and finally he exploded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but plainly the wrath he had felt toward the wilful girl was forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon youll all be some surprised when you see casita went on ladd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was rumors of another federal force on the road from case grandes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seen a good many americans from interior mexico an the stories they told would make your hair stand up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all packed guns was fightin mad at greasers an sore on the good old u <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but shore glad to get over the line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some were waitin for trains which dont run reglar no more an others were ready to hit the trails north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laddy what knocks me is rojas holding thorne prisoner trying to make him tell where mercedes had been hidden said belding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the spanish of it replied belding his voice rolling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes been a slave to the proud castilian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i was down in durango i saw something of these peons insane passions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rojas wants this girl only to have her then kill her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its damn strange boys and even with thorne here our troubles have just begun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom you spoke correct said jim ladd in his cool drawl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shore im not sayin what i think added ladd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the look of him was not indicative of a tranquil optimism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorne was put to bed in gales room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very weak yet he would keep mercedess hand and gaze at her with unbelieving eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mercedess failing hold on hope and strength seemed to have been a fantasy she was again vivid magnetic beautiful shot through and through with intense and throbbing life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she induced him to take food and drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then fighting sleep with what little strength he had left at last he succumbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all dick could ascertain his friend never stirred an eyelash nor a finger for twentyseven hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he awoke he was pale weak but the old thorne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hello dick i didnt dream it then he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there you are and my darling with the proud dark eyesshes here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it cant be those clothes and a little bronze on your face....dick youre olderyouve changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre about the seediest hungriestlooking fellow i ever saw....say old man you must have had a tough time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dark and somber fire burned out the happiness in thornes eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dick dont make medont let me think of that fiend rojas!....im here now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be well in a day or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she fell upon her knees beside thornes bed and neither of them appeared to see nell enter with a tray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then gale and nell made a good deal of unnecessary bustle in moving a small table close to the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mercedes had forgotten for the moment that her lover had been a starving man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if thorne remembered it he did not care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they held hands and looked at each other without speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nell i thought i had it bad whispered dick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its beautiful replied nell softly and she tried to coax dick from the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dick however thought he ought to remain at least long enough to tell thorne that a man in his condition could not exist solely upon love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mercedes sprang up blushing with pretty penitent manner and moving white hands eloquent of her condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried thorne as she stepped to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is not mucha malo for youas i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dick isnt she the most beautiful the loveliest the finest george i share your enthusiasm said dick dryly but mercedes isnt the only girl on earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> manifestly this was a startling piece of information and struck thorne in more than one way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george went on dick did you happen to observe the girl who saved your lifewho incidentally just fetched in your breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes brave a wonderful girl and really nicelooking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the young lady who might answer the raving eulogy you just got out of your system....iwell you havent cornered the love market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorne uttered some kind of a sound that his weakened condition would not allow to be a whoop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered at the changed look you wear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why boy youve got a different front....call the lady in and you bet ill look her over right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres plenty of time to dazzle you afterward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorne fell to upon his breakfast and made it vanish with magic speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile dick told him something of a rangers life along the border <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belding and those rangers have made you the real thingthe real western goods....what i want to know is all about the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well laddy swears shes got your girl roped in the corral for looks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill have to talk to laddy....but she must be a wonder or dick gale would never have fallen for her....isnt it great dick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you find me consoled and you are furious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you remind me of a story harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed or some unjust law alteredi forget exactly what it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he succeeded and nothing could exceed his disappointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had absolutely nothing to do almost died of ennui and became a confirmed misanthrope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besides my dear old basil if you really want to console me teach me rather to forget what has happened or to see it from a proper artistic point of view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it not gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember picking up a little vellumcovered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at marlow together the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i love beautiful things that one can touch and handle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old brocades green bronzes lacquerwork carved ivories exquisite surroundings luxury pompthere is much to be got from all these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the artistic temperament that they create or at any rate reveal is still more to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to become the spectator of ones own life as harry says is to escape the suffering of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you are surprised at my talking to you like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not realized how i have developed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a schoolboy when you knew me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have new passions new thoughts new ideas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am different but you must not like me less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am changed but you must always be my friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i am very fond of harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i know that you are better than he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not stronger you are too much afraid of lifebut you are better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how happy we used to be together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont leave me basil and dont quarrel with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lad was infinitely dear to him and his personality had been the great turning point in his art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was so much in him that was good so much in him that was noble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well dorian he said at length with a sad smile i wont speak to you again about this horrible thing after today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only trust your name wont be mentioned in connection with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inquest is to take place this afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorian shook his head and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word inquest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something so crude and vulgar about everything of the kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only my christian name and that i am quite sure she never mentioned to any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who i was and that she invariably told them my name was prince charming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must do me a drawing of sibyl basil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will try and do something dorian if it would please you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must come and sit to me yourself again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can never sit to you again basil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to say you dont like what i did of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why have you pulled the screen in front of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the best thing i have ever done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt the room looked different as i came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my servant has nothing to do with it basil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont imagine i let him arrange my room for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he settles my flowers for me sometimes that is all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light was too strong on the portrait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hallward walked towards the corner of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cry of terror broke from dorian grays lips and he rushed between the painter and the screen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> basil he said looking very pale you must not look at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you try to look at it basil on my word of honour i will never speak to you again as long as i live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont offer any explanation and you are not to ask for any <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but remember if you touch this screen everything is over between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at dorian gray in absolute amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had never seen him like this before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hands were clenched and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i wont look at it if you dont want me to he said rather coldly turning on his heel and going over towards the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but really it seems rather absurd that i shouldnt see my own work especially as i am going to exhibit it in paris in the autumn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that so i must see it some day and why not today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed dorian gray a strange sense of terror creeping over him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was the world going to be shown his secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were people to gape at the mystery of his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somethinghe did not know whathad to be done at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i dont suppose you will object to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> georges petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the rue de seze which will open the first week in october <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the portrait will only be away a month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think you could easily spare it for that time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact you are sure to be out of town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you keep it always behind a screen you cant care much about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorian gray passed his hand over his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it he cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped suddenly and a gleam of light came into his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remembered that lord henry had said to him once half seriously and half in jest if you want to have a strange quarter of an hour get basil to tell you why he wont exhibit your picture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told me why he wouldnt and it was a revelation to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> basil he said coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face we have each of us a secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me know yours and i shall tell you mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorian if i told you you might like me less than you do and you would certainly laugh at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not bear your doing either of those two things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wish me never to look at your picture again i am content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wish the best work i have ever done to be hidden from the world i am satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no basil you must tell me insisted dorian gray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i have a right to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his feeling of terror had passed away and curiosity had taken its place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was determined to find out basil hallwards mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us sit down dorian said the painter looking troubled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you undertake to govern a nation of logicchoppers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> napoleon was afraid to try he persecuted ideologists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you want to keep people from reasoning you must give them something to feel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so let us accept the roman catholic church with all its consequences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if we would have france go to mass ought we not to begin by going ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> religion you see armand is a bond uniting all the conservative principles which enable the rich to live in tranquillity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> religion and the rights of property are intimately connected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is certainly a finer thing to lead a nation by ideas of morality than by fear of the scaffold as in the time of the terrorthe one method by which your odious revolution could enforce obedience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the priest and the kingthat means you and me and the princess my neighbour and in a word the interests of all honest people personified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there my friend just be so good as to belong to your party you that might be its sylla if you had the slightest ambition that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know nothing about politics myself i argue from my own feelings but still i know enough to guess that society would be overturned if people were always calling its foundations in question if that is how your court and your government think i am sorry for you broke in montriveau <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the restoration madam ought to say like catherine de medici when she heard that the battle of dreux was lost very well now we will go to the meetinghouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the royal power of those days you won in fact while you lost in right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> political protestantism has gained an ascendancy over peoples minds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you have no mind to issue your edict of nantes or if when it is issued you publish a revocation if you should one day be accused and convicted of repudiating the charter which is simply a pledge given to maintain the interests established under the republic then the revolution will rise again terrible in her strength and strike but a single blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will not be the revolution that will go into exile she is the very soil of france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men die but peoples interests do not die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are france and the crown and rightful sovereigns and the whole world besides to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let them reign or be hurled from the throne little do i care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the duchesse de langeaiss boudoir my friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no more of the duchess no more of langeais i am with my dear antoinette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you do me the pleasure to stay where you are she said laughing and pushing him back gently however <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you have never loved me he retorted and anger flashed in lightning from his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no dear but the no was equivalent to yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a great ass he said kissing her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the terrible queen was a woman once more.antoinette he went on laying his head on her feet you are too chastely tender to speak of our happiness to anyone in this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried rising to her feet with a swift graceful spring you are a great simpleton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and without another word she fled into the drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wondered the general little knowing that the touch of his burning forehead had sent a swift electric thrill through her from foot to head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in hot wrath he followed her to the drawingroom only to hear divinely sweet chords <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the man of science or the poet can at once enjoy and comprehend bringing his intelligence to bear upon his enjoyment without loss of delight he is conscious that the alphabet and phraseology of music are but cunning instruments for the composer like the wood and copper wire under the hands of the executant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the poet and the man of science there is a music existing apart underlying the double expression of this language of the spirit and senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> andiamo mio ben can draw tears of joy or pitying laughter at the will of the singer and not unfrequently one here and there in the world some girl unable to live and bear the heavy burden of an unguessed pain some man whose soul vibrates with the throb of passion may take up a musical theme and lo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heaven is opened for them or they find a language for themselves in some sublime melody some song lost to the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the general was listening now to such a song a mysterious music unknown to all other ears as the solitary plaint of some mateless bird dying alone in a virgin forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prelude of a ballad called i believe fleuve du tage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not know that there was such music in a piano he returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said and for the first time she looked at him as a woman looks at the man she loves nor do you know my friend that i love you and that you cause me horrible suffering and that i feel that i must utter my cry of pain without putting it too plainly into words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i did not i should yieldbut you see nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armand i should die of sorrow the next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the general turned abruptly from her and went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but out in the street he brushed away the tears that he would not let fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very true i reflected the sort of letter you mean goes straight into the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do you know the sort i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my interlocutress had blushed and smiled and in a moment she added i dont believe he gets many like them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure theyre beautiful but he burns without reading <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i isnt he then in danger of burning things of importance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would perhaps be so if distinguished men hadnt an infallible nose for nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at me a moment her face was sweet and gay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in answer to which i assured her that if shed trust me with her repository id see that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats very well but it wouldnt make me see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you want very much to see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did you setyour people onto me when i was in the hut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we felt sure of catching you and bringing you out of danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwards we drew away from the scent for your good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i saw said i in the enclosure that was the puma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here prendick said montgomery youre a silly ass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come out of the water and take these revolvers and talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant do anything more than we could do now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will confess that then and indeed always i distrusted and dreaded moreau but montgomery was a man i felt i understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go up the beach said i after thinking and added holding your hands up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant do that said montgomery with an explanatory nod over his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go up to the trees then said i as you please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both turned and faced the six or seven grotesque creatures who stood there in the sunlight solid casting shadows moving and yet so incredibly unreal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> montgomery cracked his whip at them and forthwith they all turned and fled helterskelter into the trees and when montgomery and moreau were at a distance i judged sufficient i waded ashore and picked up and examined the revolvers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to satisfy myself against the subtlest trickery i discharged one at a round lump of lava and had the satisfaction of seeing the stone pulverised and the beach splashed with lead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill take the risk said i at last and with a revolver in each hand i walked up the beach towards them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it is you have wasted the best part of my day with your confounded imagination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with a touch of contempt which humiliated me he and montgomery turned and went on in silence before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the knot of beast men still wondering stood back among the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one started to follow me but retreated again when montgomery cracked his whip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they may once have been animals but i never before saw an animal trying to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now prendick i will explain said doctor moreau so soon as we had eaten and drunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must confess that you are the most dictatorial guest i ever entertained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i warn you that this is the last i shall do to oblige you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next thing you threaten to commit suicide about i shant do even at some personal inconvenience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat in my deck chair a cigar half consumed in his white dexterouslooking fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light of the swinging lamp fell on his white hair he stared through the little window out at the starlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat as far away from him as possible the table between us and the revolvers to hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not care to be with the two of them in such a little room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you admit that the vivisected human being as you called it is after all only the puma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had made me visit that horror in the inner room to assure myself of its inhumanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the puma i said still alive but so cut and mutilated as i pray i may never see living flesh again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all vile never mind that said moreau at least spare me those youthful horrors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now be quiet while i reel off my physiological lecture to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and forthwith beginning in the tone of a man supremely bored but presently warming a little he explained his work to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then there was a touch of sarcasm in his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently i found myself hot with shame at our mutual positions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i have things to do in the land of the white men i must go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after i have gone remember never to let the flies settle on your food before you eat it and do not sleep on the ground when the rains are coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iereri hope you will when the doctor stopped speaking and sat down all the monkeys clapped their hands a long time and said to one another let it be remembered always among our people that he sat and ate with us here under the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for surely he is the greatest of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the grand gorilla who had the strength of seven horses in his hairy arms rolled a great and even to this day in the heart of the jungle that stone still is there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and monkey mothers passing through the forest with their families still point down at it from the branches and whisper to their children sh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there it is lookwhere the good white man sat and ate food with us in the year of the great sickness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when the party was over the doctor and his pets started out to go back to the seashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the monkeys went with him as far as the edge of their country carrying his trunk and bags to see him off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the edge of the river they stopped and said farewell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this took a long time because all those thousands of monkeys wanted to shake john dolittle by the hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwards when the doctor and his pets we must tread softly and talk low as we go through the land of the jolliginki <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the king should hear us he will send his soldiers to catch us again for i am sure he is still very what i am wondering said the doctor is where we are going to get another boat to go home in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well perhaps well find one lying about on the beach that nobody is using <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never lift your foot till you come to the stile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day while they were passing through a very thick part of the forest cheechee went ahead of them to look for cocoanuts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and while he was away the doctor and the rest of the animals who did not know the junglepaths so well got lost in the deep woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wandered around and around but could not find their way down to the seashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cheechee when he could not see them anywhere was terribly upset <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he climbed high trees and looked out from the top branches to try and see the doctors high hat he waved and shouted he called to all the animals by name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was then that florence thought how different this ladys beauty was from what she had supposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had thought it of a proud and lofty kind yet her manner was so subdued and gentle that if she had been of florences own age and character it scarcely could have invited confidence more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> except when a constrained and singular reserve crept over her and then she seemed but florence hardly understood this though she could not choose but notice it and think about it as if she were humbled before florence and ill at ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had said that she was not her mama yet and when florence had called her the mistress of everything there this change in her was quick and startling and now while the eyes of florence rested on her face she sat as though she would have shrunk and hidden from her rather than as one about to love and cherish her in right of such a near connexion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave florence her ready promise about her new room and said she would give directions about it herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then asked some questions concerning poor paul and when they had sat in conversation for some time told florence she had come to take her to her own home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have come to london now my mother and i said edith and you shall stay with us until i am married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish that we should know and you are very kind to me said florence dear mama <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much i let me say now for it may be the best opportunity continued edith looking round to see that they were quite alone and speaking in a lower voice that when i am married and have gone away for some weeks i shall be easier at heart if you will come home here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no matter who invites you to stay elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is better to be alone than what i would say is she added checking herself do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now prepare to come with me dear slowly and thoughtfully did edith wander alone through the mansion of which she was so soon to be the lady and little heed took she of all the elegance and splendour it began to display <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same indomitable haughtiness of soul the same proud scorn expressed in eye and lip the same fierce beauty only tamed by a sense of its own little worth and of the little worth of everything around it went through the grand saloons and halls that had got loose among the shady trees and raged and rent themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mimic roses on the walls and floors were set round with sharp thorns that tore her breast in every scrap of gold so dazzling to the eye she saw some hateful atom of her purchasemoney the broad high mirrors showed her at full length a woman with a noble quality yet dwelling in her nature who was too false to her better self and too debased and lost to save herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she believed that all this was so plain more or less to all eyes that she had no resource or power of selfassertion but in pride and with this pride which tortured her own heart night and day she fought her fate out braved it and defied it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was this the woman whom florence an innocent girl strong only in her earnestness and simple truth could so impress and quell that by her side she was another creature with her tempest of passion hushed and her very pride itself subdued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was this the woman who now sat beside her in a carriage with her arms entwined and who while she courted and entreated her to love and trust her drew her fair head to nestle on her breast and would have laid down life to shield it from wrong or harm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it were well to die indeed at such a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> better and happier far perhaps to die so edith than to live on to the end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the honourable mrs skewton who was thinking of anything rather than of such sentiments for like many genteel persons who have existed at various times she set her face against death altogether and objected to the mention of any such low and levelling upstart had borrowed a house in brook street grosvenor square from a stately relative one of the feenix brood who was out of town and who did not object to lending it in the handsomest manner for nuptial purposes as the loan implied his final release and acquittance from all further loans and gifts to mrs skewton and her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it being necessary for the credit of the family to make a handsome appearance at such a time mrs skewton with the assistance of an accommodating tradesman resident in the parish of marylebone who lent out all sorts of articles to the nobility and gentry from a service of plate to an army of footmen clapped into this house a silverheaded butler who was charged extra on that account as having the appearnce of an ancient family retainer two very tall young men in livery and a select staff of kitchenservants so that a legend arose downstairs that withers the page released at once from his numerous household duties and from the propulsion of the wheeledchair inconsistent with the metropolis had been several times observed to rub his eyes and pinch his limbs as if he misdoubted his having overslept himself at the leamington milkmans and being still in a celestial dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a variety of requisites in plate and china being also conveyed to the same establishment from the same convenient source with several miscellaneous articles including a neat chariot and a pair of bays mrs skewton cushioned herself on the principal sofa in the cleopatra attitude and held her court in fair state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how said mrs skewton on the entrance of her daughter and her charge is my charming florence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must come and kiss me florence was timidly stooping to pick out a place in the white part of mrs skewtons face when that lady presented her ear and relieved her of her difficulty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edith my dear said mrs skewton positively i stand a little more in the light my sweetest florence for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont remember dearest edith said her mother what you were when you were about the same age as our exceedingly precious for positively my dear said mrs skewton i do think that i see a decided resemblance to what you were then in our extremely fascinating young friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it shows said mrs skewton in a lower voice which conveyed her opinion that florence was in a very it does indeed was ediths stern reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her mother eyed her sharply for a moment and feeling herself on my charming florence you must come and kiss me once more if you florence complied of course and again imprinted her lips on mrs skewtons ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you have heard no doubt my darling pet said mrs skewton detaining her hand that your papa whom we all perfectly adore and i knew it would be very soon returned florence but not exactly my darling edith urged her mother gaily is it possible you why should i tell florence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she returned so suddenly and harshly that florence could scarcely believe it was the same voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs skewton then told florence as another and safer diversion that her father was coming to dinner and that he would no doubt be charmingly surprised to see her as he had spoken last night of dressing in the city and had known nothing of ediths design the execution of which according to mrs skewtons expectation would throw him into a perfect ecstasy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> florence was troubled to hear this and her distress became so keen as the dinnerhour approached that if she had known how to frame an entreaty to be suffered to return home without involving her father in her explanation she would have hurried back on foot bareheaded breathless and alone rather than incur the risk of meeting his displeasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the time drew nearer she could hardly breathe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dared not approach a window lest he should see her from the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dared not go upstairs to hide her emotion lest in passing out at the door she should meet him unexpectedly besides which dread she felt as though she never could come back again if she were summoned to his presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this conflict of fears she was sitting by cleopatras couch endeavouring to understand and to reply to the bald discourse of that lady when she heard his foot upon the stair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cleopatra who in her juvenility was always playfully disposed and who in her selfengrossment did not trouble herself about the nature of this agitation pushed florence behind her couch and dropped a shawl over her preparatory to giving mr dombey a rapture of surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so quickly done that in a moment florence heard his awful step in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saluted his intended motherinlaw and his intended bride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strange sound of his voice thrilled through the whole frame of his child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear dombey said cleopatra come here and tell me how your florence is very well said mr dombey advancing towards the couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear dombey returned cleopatra with bewitching vivacity now are you sure you are not deceiving me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what my dearest edith will say to me when i make such a declaration but upon though he had been and had been detected on the spot in the most enormous falsehood that was ever said or done he could hardly have been more disconcerted than he was when mrs skewton plucked the shawl away and florence pale and trembling rose before him like a ghost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not yet recovered his presence of mind when florence had run up to him clasped her hands round his neck kissed his face and hurried out of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked round as if to refer the matter to somebody else but edith had gone after florence instantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now confess my dear dombey said mrs skewton giving him her i never was more surprised said mr dombey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i yes i am exceedingly glad to meet florence here said mr dombey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he appeared to consider gravely about it for a moment and then said more decidedly yes i really am very glad indeed to meet edith perhaps suggested mr dombey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one shouldnt tell these things your sex my dear dombey are so vain and so apt to abuse our weakness but you this was addressed to one of the very tall young men who announced dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but edith my dear dombey she continued in a whisper when she cannot have you near her and as i tell her she cannot expect that always will at least have near her something or somebody belonging to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in this spirit nothing would keep her from riding off today to fetch our darling as she waited for an answer mr dombey answered eminently so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless you my dear dombey for that proof of heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take me downstairs like an angel and let us see what these people intend to cleopatra skipping off her couch with tolerable briskness after the last benediction mr dombey took her arm in his and led her ceremoniously downstairs one of the very tall young men on hire whose organ of veneration was imperfectly developed thrusting his tongue into his cheek for the entertainment of the other very tall young man on hire as the couple turned into the diningroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> florence and edith were already there and sitting side by side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> florence would have risen when her father entered to resign her chair to him but edith openly put her hand upon her arm and mr dombey took an opposite place at the round table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conversation was almost entirely sustained by mrs skewton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> florence hardly dared to raise her eyes lest they should reveal the traces of tears far less dared to speak and edith never uttered one word unless in answer to a question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> verily cleopatra worked hard for the establishment that was so nearly clutched and verily it should have been a rich one to reward her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so your preparations are nearly finished at last my dear dombey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said cleopatra when the dessert was put upon the table and the silverheaded butler had withdrawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the lawyers yes madam replied mr dombey the deed of settlement the professional gentlemen inform me is now ready and as i was mentioning to you edith has only to do us the favour to suggest her edith sat like a handsome statue as cold as silent and as still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dearest love said cleopatra do you hear what mr dombey says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aside to that gentleman how her absence as the time approaches reminds me of the days when that most i have nothing to suggest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it shall be when you please said edith scarcely looking over the table at mr dombey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or would next day said mr dombey suit your engagements i have no engagements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let it be no engagements my dear edith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remonstrated her mother when you are in a most terrible state of flurry all day long and have a they are of your making returned edith turning on her with a slight contraction of her brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and mr dombey can arrange between very true indeed my love and most considerate of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my darling florence you must really come and kiss me once singular coincidence that these gushes of interest in florence hurried cleopatra away from almost every dialogue in which edith had a share however trifling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> florence had certainly never undergone so much embracing and perhaps had never been unconsciously so useful in her life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr dombey was far from quarrelling in his own breast with the manner of his beautiful betrothed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had that good reason for sympathy with haughtiness and coldness which is found in a fellowfeeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it flattered him to think how these deferred to him in ediths case and seemed to have no will apart from his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it flattered him to picture to himself this proud and stately woman doing the honours of his house and chilling his guests after his own manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dignity of dombey and son would be heightened and maintained indeed in such hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so thought mr dombey when he was left alone at the diningtable and mused upon his past and future fortunes finding no uncongeniality in an air of scant and gloomy state that pervaded the room in colour a dark brown with black hatchments of pictures blotching the walls and twentyfour black chairs with almost as many nails in them as so many coffins waiting like mutes upon the threshold of the turkey carpet and two exhausted negroes holding up two withered branches of candelabra on the sideboard and a musty smell prevailing as if the ashes of ten thousand dinners were entombed in the sarcophagus below it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the owner of the house lived much abroad the air of england seldom agreed long with a member of the feenix family and the room had gradually put itself into deeper and still deeper mourning for him until it was become so funereal as to want nothing but a body in it to be quite complete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no bad representation of the body for the nonce in his unbending form if not in his attitude mr dombey looked down into the cold depths of the dead sea of mahogany on which the fruit dishes and decanters lay at anchor as if the subjects of his thoughts were rising towards the surface one by one and plunging down again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edith was there in all her majesty of brow and figure and close to her came florence with her timid head turned to him as it had been for an instant when she left the room and ediths eyes upon her and ediths hand put out protectingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little figure in a low armchair came springing next into the light and looked upon him wonderingly with its bright eyes and its oldyoung face gleaming as in the flickering of an evening fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again came florence close upon it and absorbed his whole attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether as a foredoomed difficulty and disappointment to him whether as a rival who had crossed him in his way and might again whether as his child of whom in his successful wooing he could stoop to think as claiming at such a time to be no more estranged or whether as a hint to him that the mere appearance of caring for his own blood should be maintained in his new relations he best knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indifferently well perhaps at best for marriage company and marriage altars and ambitious scenes still blotted here and there with florence always florence turned up so fast and so confusedly that he rose and went upstairs to escape them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite late at night before candles were brought for at present they made mrs skewtons head ache she complained and in the meantime florence and mrs skewton talked together cleopatra being very anxious to keep her close to herself or florence touched the piano softly for mrs skewtons delight to make no mention of a few occasions in the course of the evening when that affectionate lady was impelled to solicit another kiss and which always happened after edith had said anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not many however for edith sat apart by an open window during the whole time in spite of her mothers fears that she would take cold and remained there until mr dombey took leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was serenely gracious to florence when he did so and florence went to bed in a room within ediths so happy and hopeful that she thought of her late self as if it were some other poor deserted girl who was to be pitied for her sorrow and in her pity sobbed herself to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were drives to milliners dressmakers jewellers lawyers florists pastrycooks and florence was always of the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> florence was to cast off her mourning and to wear a brilliant dress on the occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the milliners intentions on the subject of this dress the milliner was a frenchwoman and greatly resembled mrs skewton were so chaste and elegant that mrs skewton bespoke one like it for herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the milliner said it would become her to admiration and that all the world would take her for the young ladys sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edith looked at nothing and cared for nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her rich dresses came home and were tried on and were loudly commended by mrs skewton and the milliners and were put away without a word from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs skewton made their plans for every day and executed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes edith sat in the carriage when they went to make purchases sometimes when it was absolutely necessary she went into the shops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mrs skewton conducted the whole business whatever it happened to be and edith looked on as uninterested and with as much apparent indifference as if she had no concern in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> florence might perhaps have thought she was haughty and listless but that she was never so to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so florence quenched her wonder in her gratitude whenever it broke out and soon subdued it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last night of the week the night before the marriage was come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the dark room for mrs skewtons head was no better yet though she expected to recover permanently tomorrow were that lady edith and mr dombey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edith was at her open window looking out into the street mr dombey and cleopatra were talking softly on the sofa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was growing late and florence being fatigued had gone to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear dombey said cleopatra you will leave me florence mr dombey said he would with pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to have her about me here while you are both at paris and to think at her age i am assisting in the formation of her mind my dear dombey said cleopatra will be a perfect balm to me in the edith turned her head suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her listless manner was exchanged in a moment to one of burning interest and unseen in the darkness she attended closely to their conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr dombey would be delighted to leave florence in such admirable guardianship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear dombey returned cleopatra a thousand thanks for your good opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feared you were going with malice aforethought as the dreadful lawyers say those horrid proses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to condemn me to why do me so great an injustice my dear madam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because my charming florence tells me so positively she must go home tomorrow returned cleopatra that i began to be afraid my i assure you madam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said mr dombey i have laid no commands on my dear dombey replied cleopatra what a courtier you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though ill not say so either for courtiers have no heart and yours pervades your farming life and character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and are you really going so oh indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was late and mr dombey feared he must <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is this a fact or is it all a dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can i believe my dearest dombey that you are coming back tomorrow morning mr dombey who was accustomed to take things literally reminded mrs skewton that they were to meet first at the church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pang said mrs skewton of consigning a child even to you my dear dombey is one of the most excruciating imaginable and combined with a naturally delicate constitution and the extreme stupidity of the pastrycook who has undertaken the breakfast is almost too much for my poor strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i shall rally my dear dombey in the morning do not fear for me or be uneasy on my account <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edith who had turned her head again towards the window and whose interest in their conversation had ceased rose up in her place but made no advance towards him and said nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr dombey with a lofty gallantry adapted to his dignity and the occasion betook his creaking boots towards her put her hand to his lips said tomorrow morning i shall have the happiness of claiming this hand as mrs dombeys and bowed himself solemnly out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs skewton rang for candles as soon as the housedoor had closed upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the candles appeared her maid with the juvenile dress that was to delude the world tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dress had savage retribution in it as such dresses ever have and made her infinitely older and more hideous than her greasy flannel gown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mrs skewton tried it on with mincing satisfaction smirked at her cadaverous self in the glass as she thought of its killing effect upon the major and suffering her maid to take it off again and to prepare her for repose tumbled into ruins like a house of painted cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this time edith remained at the dark window looking out into the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she and her mother were at last left alone she moved from it for the first time that evening and came opposite to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the yawning shaking peevish figure of the mother with her eyes raised to confront the proud erect form of the daughter whose glance of fire was bent downward upon her had a conscious air upon it that no levity or temper could conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no child would be half so listen to me mother returned edith passing these words by with a scorn that would not descend to trifle with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must remain must remain alone here edith until you return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or in that name upon which i shall call tomorrow to witness what i do so falsely and so shamefully i swear i will refuse the hand of this man in the church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i do not may i fall dead upon the the mother answered with a look of quick alarm in no degree diminished by the look she met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is enough said edith steadily that we are what we are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will have no youth and truth dragged down to my level <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will have no guileless nature undermined corrupted and perverted to amuse the leisure of a world of mothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> florence must go you are an idiot edith cried her angry mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you expect there can ever be peace for you in that house till she is married ask me or ask yourself if i ever expect peace in that house said her daughter and you know the answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and am i to be told tonight after all my pains and labour and when you are going through me to be rendered independent her mother almost shrieked in her passion while her palsied head shook like a leaf that there is corruption and contagion in me and that i i have put the question to myself said edith ashy pale and pointing to the window more than once when i have been sitting there and something in the faded likeness of my sex has wandered past outside and god knows i have met with my reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh mother mother if you had but left me to my natural heart when i too was a girl a sensible that any show of anger was useless here her mother restrained herself and fell a whimpering and bewailed that she had lived too long and that her only child had cast her off and that duty towards parents was forgotten in these evil days and that she had heard unnatural taunts and cared for life no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if one is to go on living through continual scenes like this she whinedi am sure it would be much better for me to think of some means of putting an end to my existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of your being my between us mother returned edith mournfully the time for mutual reproaches is past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know that you are lacerating me in the cruellest manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know how sensitive i am to unkindness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at such a moment too when i have so much to think of and am naturally anxious to appear to the best advantage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make your mother a fright upon your edith bent the same fixed look upon her as she sobbed and rubbed her eyes and said in the same low steady voice which had neither risen nor fallen since she first addressed her i have said that let her go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is so much to me that rather than communicate or suffer to be communicated to her one grain of the evil that is in my breast mother i would renounce you as i would if you gave me cause renounce him in the church tomorrow replied edith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shall not while i can interpose be tampered with and tainted by the lessons i have learned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is no hard condition on if you had proposed it in a filial manner edith whined her mother perhaps not very likely not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but such extremely cutting they are past and at an end between us now said edith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take your own way mother share as you please in what you have gained spend enjoy make much of it and be as happy as you will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lips are closed upon the past from this hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forgive you your part in without a tremor in her voice or frame and passing onward with a foot that set itself upon the neck of every soft emotion she bade her mother goodnight and repaired to her own room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not to rest for there was no rest in the tumult of her agitation when alone to and fro and to and fro and to and fro again five hundred times among the splendid preparations for her adornment on the morrow with her dark hair shaken down her dark eyes flashing with a raging light her broad white bosom red with the cruel grasp of the relentless hand with which she spurned it from her pacing up and down with an averted head as if she would avoid the sight of her own fair person and divorce herself from its companionship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus in the dead time of the night before her bridal edith granger wrestled with her unquiet spirit tearless friendless silent proud and uncomplaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length it happened that she touched the open door which led into the room where florence lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a light was burning there and showed her florence in her bloom of innocence and beauty fast asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edith held her breath and felt herself drawn on towards her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drawn nearer nearer nearer yet at last drawn so near that stooping down she pressed her lips to the gentle hand that lay outside the bed and put it softly to her neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its touch was like the prophets rod of old upon the rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her tears sprung forth beneath it as she sunk upon her knees and laid her aching head and streaming hair upon the pillow by its side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus edith granger passed the night before her bridal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus the sun found her on her bridal morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter dawn with its passionless blank face steals shivering to the church beneath which lies the dust of little paul and his mother and looks in at the windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> night crouches yet upon the pavement and broods sombre and heavy in nooks and corners of the building <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the steepleclock perched up above the houses emerging from beneath another of the countless ripples in the tide of time that regularly roll and break on the eternal shore is greyly visible like a stone beacon recording how the sea flows on but within doors dawn at first can only peep at night and see that it is there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hovering feebly round the church and looking in dawn moans and weeps for its short reign and its tears trickle on the windowglass and the trees against the churchwall bow their heads and wring their many hands in sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> night growing pale before it gradually fades out of the church but lingers in the vaults below and sits upon the coffins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now comes bright day burnishing the steepleclock and reddening the spire and drying up the tears of dawn and stifling its complaining and the dawn following the night and chasing it from its last refuge shrinks into the vaults itself and hides with a frightened face among the dead until night returns refreshed to drive it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now the mice who have been busier with the prayerbooks than their proper owners and with the hassocks more worn by their little teeth than by human knees hide their bright eyes in their holes and gather close together in affright at the resounding clashing of the churchdoor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the beadle that man of power comes early this morning with the sexton and mrs miff the wheezy little pewopener a mighty dry old lady sparely dressed with not an inch of fulness anywhere about her is also here and has been waiting at the churchgate halfanhour as her place is for the beadle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a vinegary face has mrs miff and a mortified bonnet and eke a thirsty soul for sixpences and shillings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beckoning to stray people to come into pews has given mrs miff an air of mystery and there is reservation in the eye of mrs miff as always knowing of a softer seat but having her suspicions of the fee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no such fact as mr miff nor has there been these twenty years and mrs miff would rather not allude to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held some bad opinions it would seem about free seats and though mrs miff hopes he may be gone upwards she couldnt positively undertake to say so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> busy is mrs miff this morning at the churchdoor beating and dusting the altarcloth the carpet and the cushions and much has mrs miff to say about the wedding they are going to have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs miff is told that the new furniture and alterations in the house cost full five thousand pound if they cost a penny and mrs miff has heard upon the best authority that the lady hasnt got a sixpence wherewithal to bless herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs miff remembers like wise as if it had happened yesterday the first wifes funeral and then the christening and then the other funeral and mrs miff says bythebye shell soapandwater that ere tablet presently against the company arrive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr sownds the beadle who is sitting in the sun upon the church steps all this time and seldom does anything else except in cold weather sitting by the fire approves of mrs miffs discourse and asks if mrs miff has heard it said that the lady is uncommon handsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the information mrs miff has received being of this nature mr sownds the beadle who though orthodox and corpulent is still an admirer of female beauty observes with unction yes he hears she is a spanker an expression that seems somewhat forcible to mrs miff or would from any lips but those of mr sownds the beadle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in mr dombeys house at this same time there is great stir and bustle more especially among the women not one of whom has had a wink of sleep since four oclock and all of whom were fully dressed before six <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr towlinson is an object of greater consideration than usual to the housemaid and the cook says at breakfast time that one wedding makes many which the housemaid cant believe and dont think true at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr towlinson reserves his sentiments on this question being rendered something gloomy by the engagement of a foreigner with whiskers mr towlinson is whiskerless himself who has been hired to accompany the happy pair to paris and who is busy packing the new chariot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in respect of this personage mr towlinson admits presently that he never knew of any good that ever come of foreigners and being charged by the ladies with prejudice says look at bonaparte who was at the head of em and see what he was always up to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pastrycook is hard at work in the funereal room in brook street and the very tall young men are busy looking on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the very tall young men already smells of sherry and his eyes have a tendency to become fixed in his head and to stare at objects without seeing them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very tall young man is conscious of this failing in himself and informs his comrade that its his exciseman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very tall young man would say excitement but his speech is hazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men who play the bells have got scent of the marriage and the marrowbones and cleavers too and a brass band too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first are practising in a back settlement near battlebridge the second put themselves in communication through their chief with mr towlinson to whom they offer terms to be bought off and the third in the person of an artful trombone lurks and dodges round the corner waiting for some traitor tradesman to reveal the place and hour of breakfast for a bribe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> expectation and excitement extend further yet and take a wider range <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from balls pond mr perch brings mrs perch to spend the day with mr dombeys servants and accompany them surreptitiously to see the wedding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in mr tootss lodgings mr toots attires himself as if he were at least the bridegroom determined to behold the spectacle in splendour from a secret corner of the gallery and thither to convey the chicken for it is mr tootss desperate intent to point out florence to the chicken then and there and openly to say now chicken i will not deceive you any longer the friend i have sometimes mentioned to you is myself miss dombey is the object of my passion what are your opinions chicken in this state of things and what on the spot do you advise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the somuchtobeastonished chicken in the meanwhile dips his beak into a tankard of strong beer in mr tootss kitchen and pecks up two pounds of beefsteaks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i make assorted flutters for flags and bunting and a superior grade of rustles for ladies silk gowns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought so said the wizard with a sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes indeed come into my shop please and the braided man turned and led the way into a smaller cave where he evidently lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here on a broad shelf were several cardboard boxes of various sizes each tied with cotton cord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this said the man taking up a box and handling it gently contains twelve dozen rustlesenough to last any lady a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you open the box the rustles will escape whether you are wearing a silk dress or not said the man seriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this he continued are many assorted flutters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day when there is no wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you sir turning to the wizard ought to have this assortment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once you have tried my goods i am sure you will never be without them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no money with me said the wizard evasively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not want money returned the braided man for i could not spend it in this deserted place if i had it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i would like very much a blue hairribbon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will notice my braids are tied with yellow pink brown red green white and black but i have no blue ribbons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried dorothy who was sorry for the poor man so she ran back to the buggy and took from her suitcase a pretty blue ribbon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did her good to see how the braided mans eyes sparkled when he received this treasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have made me very very happy my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed and then he insisted on the wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girl accepting the box of rustles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may need them some time he said and there is really no use in my manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did you leave the surface of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a sad story but if you will try to restrain your tears i will tell you about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on earth i was a manufacturer of imported holes for american swiss cheese and i will acknowledge that i supplied a superior article which was in great demand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also i made pores for porous plasters and highgrade holes for doughnuts and buttons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally i invented a new adjustable posthole which i thought would make my fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i manufactured a large quantity of these postholes and having no room in which to store them i set them all end to end and put the top one in the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that made an extraordinary long hole as you may imagine and reached far down into the earth and as i leaned over it to try to see to the bottom i lost my balance and tumbled in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unfortunately the hole led directly into the vast space you see outside this mountain but i managed to catch a point of rock that projected from this cavern and so saved myself from tumbling headlong into the black waves beneath where the tongues of flame that dart out would certainly have consumed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here then i made my home and although it is a lonely place i amuse myself making rustles and flutters and so get along very nicely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the braided man had completed this strange tale dorothy nearly laughed because it was all so absurd but the wizard tapped his forehead significantly to indicate that he thought the poor man was crazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they politely bade him good day and went back to the outer cavern to resume their journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landing where there was a rift in the mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on peering out all they could see was rolling banks of clouds so thick that they obscured all else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the travellers were obliged to rest and while they were sitting on the rocky floor the wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the nine tiny piglets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his delight they were now plainly visible which proved that they had passed beyond the influence of the magical valley of voe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes sighed eureka and i also can see you again and the sight makes me dreadfully hungry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wizard may i eat just one of the fat little piglets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd never miss one of them im sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed a piglet and after weve been such good friends too and played with one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thomas one might call it says somewhere that christs great achievement was that he made himself as much loved after his death as he had been during his lifetime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and certainly if his place is among the poets he is the leader of all the lovers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw that love was the first secret of the world for which the wise men had been looking and that it was only through love that one could approach either the heart of the leper or the feet of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and above all christ is the most supreme of individualists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> humility like the artistic acceptance of all experiences is merely a mode of manifestation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is mans soul that christ is always looking for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he calls it gods kingdom and finds it in every one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he compares it to little things to a tiny seed to a handful of leaven to a pearl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is because one realises ones soul only by getting rid of all alien passions all acquired culture and all external possessions be they good or evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bore up against everything with some stubbornness of will and much rebellion of nature till i had absolutely nothing left in the world but one thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had lost my name my position my happiness my freedom my wealth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly they were taken away from me by the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a blow so appalling that i did not know what to do so i flung myself on my knees and bowed my head and wept and said the body of a child is as the body of the lord i am not worthy of either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw then that the only thing for me was to accept everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since then curious as it will no doubt sound i have been happier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was of course my soul in its ultimate essence that i had reached <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already the bride was stepping daintily down the gangway her ladies following primly one by one a few minutes more and we should all be aboard the hawsers would splash in the water the sails would fill and strain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the deck i should see the little walled town recede and sink and grow dim while every plunge of our bows brought us nearer to the happy islandit was an island we were bound for i knew well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already i could see the islandpeople waving hands on the crowded quay whence the little houses ran up the hill to the castle crowning all with its towers and battlements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more we should ride together a merry procession clattering up the steep street and through the grim gateway and then we should have arrived then we should all dine together then we should have reached home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bitter it is to stumble out of an opalescent dream into the cold daylight cruel to lose in a second a seavoyage an island and a castle that was to be practically your own but cruellest and bitterest of all to know in addition to your loss that the fingers of an angry aunt have you tight by the scruff of your neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my beautiful book was gone tooravished from my grasp by the dressy lady who joined in the outburst of denunciation as heartily as if she had been a relativeand naught was left me but to blubber dismally awakened of a sudden to the harshness of real things and the unnumbered hostilities of the actual world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cared little for their reproaches their abuse but i sorrowed heartily for my lost ship my vanished island my uneaten dinner and for the knowledge that if i wanted any angels to play with i must henceforth put up with the anaemic nightgowned nonentities that hovered over the bed of the sundayschool child in the pages of the sabbath improver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was led ignominiously out of the house in a pulpy watery state while the butler handled his swing doors with a stony impassive countenance intended for the deception of the very elect though it did not deceive me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew well enough that next time he was off duty and strolled around our way we should meet in our kitchen as man to man and i would punch him and ask him riddles and he would teach me tricks with corks and bits of string <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so his unsympathetic manner did not add to my depression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i maintained a diplomatic blubber long after we had been packed into our ponycarriage and the lodgegate had clicked behind us because it served as a sort of armourplating against heckling and argument and abuse and i was thinking hard and wanted to be let alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the thoughts that i was thinking were two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first i thought ive got ahead of charlotte this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and next i thought when ive grown up big and have money of my own and a fullsized walkingstick i will set out early one morning and never stop till i get to that little walled town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there ought to be no real difficulty in the task <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it only meant asking here and asking there and people were very obliging and i could describe every stick and stone of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the island which i had never even seen that was not so easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet i felt confident that somehow at some time sooner or later i was destined to arrive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened one day that some ladies came to call who were not at all the sort i was used to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they suffered from a grievance so far as i could gather and the burden of their plaint was manmen in general and man in particular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though the words were but spoken i could clearly discern the capital m in their of course i was not present officially so to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> durdles has lighted his lantern by drawing from the cold hard wall a spark of that mysterious fire which lurks in everything and guided by this speck they clamber up among the cobwebs and the dust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice or thrice they emerge into level lowarched galleries whence they can look down into the moonlit nave and where durdles waving his lantern waves the dim angels heads upon the corbels of the roof seeming to watch their progress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anon they turn into narrower and steeper staircases and the nightair begins to blow upon them and the chirp of some startled jackdaw or frightened rook precedes the heavy beating of wings in a confined space and the beating down of dust and straws upon their heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last leaving their light behind a stair for it blows fresh up here they look down on cloisterham fair to see in the moonlight its ruined habitations and sanctuaries of the dead at the towers base its moss softened redtiled roofs and redbrick houses of the living clustered beyond its river winding down from the mist on the horizon as though that were its source and already heaving with a restless knowledge of its approach towards the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jasper always moving softly with no visible reason contemplates the scene and especially that stillest part of it which the cathedral overshadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he contemplates durdles quite as curiously and durdles is by times conscious of his watchful eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only by times because durdles is growing drowsy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as aeronauts lighten the load they carry when they wish to rise similarly durdles has lightened the wicker bottle in coming up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snatches of sleep surprise him on his legs and stop him in his talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mild fit of calenture seizes him in which he deems that the ground so far below is on a level with the tower and would as lief walk off the tower into the air as not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such is his state when they begin to come down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as aeronauts make themselves heavier when they wish to descend similarly durdles charges himself with more liquid from the wicker bottle that he may come down the better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the iron gate attained and locked but not before durdles has tumbled twice and cut an eyebrow open once they descend into the crypt again with the intent of issuing forth as they entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while returning among those lanes of light durdles becomes so very uncertain both of foot and speech that he half drops half throws himself down by one of the heavy pillars scarcely less heavy than itself and indistinctly appeals to his companion for forty winks of a second each <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will have it so or must have it so replies jasper ill durdles is asleep at once and in his sleep he dreams a dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not much of a dream considering the vast extent of the domains of dreamland and their wonderful productions it is only remarkable for being unusually restless and unusually real <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dreams of lying there asleep and yet counting his companions footsteps as he walks to and fro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dreams that the footsteps die away into distance of time and of space and that something touches him and that something falls from his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then something clinks and gropes about and he dreams that he is alone for so long a time that the lanes of light take new directions as the moon advances in her course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from succeeding unconsciousness he passes into a dream of slow uneasiness from cold and painfully awakes to a perception of the lanes of light really changed much as he had dreamed and jasper walking among them beating his hands and feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know that they strike four quarters and then the great bell strikes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cries durdles scrambling up why didnt you try to wake i did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might as well have tried to wake the dead your own as durdles recalls that touching something in his dream he looks down on the pavement and sees the key of the crypt door lying close to where he himself lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says picking it up and recalling that part of his dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he gathers himself up again into an upright position or into a position as nearly upright as he ever maintains he is again conscious of being watched by his companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray dont let me get my bundle right mister jarsper and im with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he ties it afresh he is once more conscious that he is very narrowly observed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you suspect me of mister jarsper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asks with drunken ive no suspicions of you my good mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> durdles but i have suspicions that my bottle was filled with something stiffer than either of us supposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i also have suspicions jasper adds taking it from the pavement and turning it bottom upwards that durdles condescends to laugh at this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> continuing to chuckle when his laugh is over as though remonstrant with himself on his drinking powers he rolls to the door and unlocks it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they both pass out and durdles relocks it and pockets his key <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a thousand thanks for a curious and interesting night says i should think so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you was to offer durdles the affront to show him his way home he wouldnt go home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> durdles wouldnt go home till morning durdles wouldnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each is turning his own way when a sharp whistle rends the widdy widdy wen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ket ches im out ar ter ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then e dont go then i shy instantly afterwards a rapid fire of stones rattles at the cathedral wall and the hideous small boy is beheld opposite dancing in the moonlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cries jasper in a fury so quickly roused and so violent that he seems an older devil himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall shed the blood of that impish wretch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> regardless of the fire though it hits him more than once he rushes at deputy collars him and tries to bring him across <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but deputy is not to be so easily brought across <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a diabolical insight into the strongest part of his position he is no sooner taken by the throat than he curls up his legs forces his assailant to hang him as it were and gurgles in his throat and screws his body and twists as already undergoing the first agonies of strangulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing for it but to drop him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he instantly gets himself together backs over to durdles and cries to his assailant gnashing the great gap in ill blind yer selp me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i dont have yer eyesight bellows me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time dodging behind durdles and snarling at jasper now from this side of him and now from that prepared if pounced upon to dart away in all manner of curvilinear directions and if run down after all to dont hurt the boy mister jarsper urges durdles shielding him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replies deputy in his one form of polite contradiction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id only jist come out for with the usual rhythm and dance though dodging behind durdles take him home then retorts jasper ferociously though with a strong check upon himself and let my eyes be rid of the sight of deputy with another sharp whistle at once expressing his relief and his commencement of a milder stoning of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> durdles begins stoning that respectable gentleman home as if he were a reluctant ox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thus as everything comes to an end the unaccountable expedition comes to an end for the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss twinkletons establishment was about to undergo a serene hush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what had once and at no remote period been called even by the erudite miss twinkleton herself the half but what was now called as being more elegant and more strictly collegiate the term would expire tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carl looked the picture of astonishment when he read this letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his employer took the letter from his hand and ran his eye over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you wish to ask my advice about the investment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to know how such a letter came to be written to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt you send a letter of inquiry there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sir and i cant understand how these men could have got hold of my name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some one has probably written in your name he said after a pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will leave the letter in my hands i may be able to obtain some information on that point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall be glad if you can mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont mention to anyone having received such a letter and if anyone broaches the subject let me know who it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings quietly put on his hat and walked over to the post office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the postmaster who also kept a general variety store chanced to be alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sweetland though it is doubtful if you can give it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know if any letter has been posted from this office within a few days addressed to pitkins gamp syracuse new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes two letters have been handed in bearing this address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings was surprised for he had never thought of two letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you tell me who handed them in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both were handed in by the same party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that was a boy in your employ <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it possible that carl was deceiving him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no the boy who usually calls for the factory mail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nephew of your bookkeeper i think his name is leonard craig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you happen to remember if any other letter like this was received at the office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he displayed the envelope of carls letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes one was received addressed to the name of the one who deposited the first letters leonard craig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be kind enough not to mention the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings bought a supply of stamps and then left the office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well carl he said when he reentered the house i have discovered who wrote in your name to pitkins gamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what could induce him to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought that i would see the letter and would be prejudiced against you if i discovered that you were investing in what is a species of lottery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have thought you unwise and i should have been reminded of a fellow workman who became so infatuated with lotteries that he stole money from his employer to enable him to continue his purchases of tickets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for this unhappy passion he would have remained honest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is jealous of you i warned you he or some one else might become so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the most curious circumstance is he wrote a second letter in his own name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i advise you to say nothing about the matter unless questioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day carl met leonard in the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the way said leonard you got a letter yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i brought it to the factory with the rest of the mail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seems to be closemouthed leonard said to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has sent for a ticket ill bet a hat and dont want me to find out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could draw the capital prize i would not mind old jennings finding out then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought that letter might be from your home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carl was quietly amused at leonards skillful questions but was determined not to give him any light on the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt mind being rich myself said carl with a smile <end> <end>

<start> <start> because sometimes you arrive where you are going to partly smeared over the trucks and in no condi tion fur to be made welcome to our city as doctor kirby would say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every oncet in a while you read a little piece in a newspaper about a man being found alongside the tracks considerable cut up or laying right acrost them mebby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is held in the morgue a while and no one knows who he is and none of the train crew knows they has run over a man and the engineer says they wasnt none on the track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moren likely that feller has been riding the rods along about the middle of the train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mebby he let himself go to sleep and jest rolled off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mebby his piece of board slipped and he fell when the train jolted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or mebby he jest natcherally made up his mind he rather let loose and get squashed then get any more cinders into his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> riding the blind baggage or the bumpers gives me all the excitement i wants or all the gambling chancet either others can have the rods fur all of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they is some people ack shally says they likes em best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a good place if it is winter time is the feed rack over a cattle car fur the heat and steam from all them steers in there will keep you warm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dont crawl in no lumber car that is only loaded about half full and short lengths and bundles of laths and shingles in her fur they is likely to get to shifting and bumping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> myself not being like these bums that is too proud to work i have often helped the fireman shovel coal and paid fur my ride thataway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but an empty fur gineral purposes will do about as well as anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this feller looney hogan that was with me was a kind of a harmless critter and he didnt know jest where he was going nor why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was mostly scared of things and if you spoke to him quick he shivered first and then grinned idiotic so you wouldnt kick him and when he talked he had a silly little giggle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been made thataway in a reform school where they took him young and tried to work the cussedness outn him by batting him around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they worked it out and purty nigh every thing else along with it i guess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looney had had a pardner whose name was slim he said but a couple of years before slim had fell overboard offn a barge up to duluth and never come up agin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looney knowed slim was drownded all right but he was always travelling around looking at tanks and freight depots and switch shanties fur slims mark to be fresh cut with a knife somewheres so he would know where to foller and ketch up with him agin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knowed he would never find slims mark he said but he kept alooking and he guessed that was the way he got the name of looney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said he was going east from there he guessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was hindered considerable being put off of trains three or four times and hav ing to grab these here slow local freights between towns all the way down through kentuckey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any wheres south of the ohio river and east of the mississippi river trainmen is grouchier to them they thinks is bums than north of it anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in some parts of it if a real bum gets pinched heaven help im fur nothing else wont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night between twelve and one oclock i was put off of a freight train fur the second time in a place in the northern part of tennessee right near the kentuckey line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i set down in a lumber yard near the railroad track and when she started up agin i grabbed onto the iron ladder and swung my self aboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the brakeman was watching fur me and clumb down the ladder and stamped on my fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i dropped off with one finger con siderable mashed and set down in that lumber yard wondering what next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a dark night and so fur as i could see they wasnt much moving in that town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one was way acrost the town square from me and it was the telephone exchange with a man operator reading a book in there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other was the telegraph room in the depot about a hundred yards from me and they was only two fellers in it both smoking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the main business part of the town was built up around the square like lots of oldfashioned towns is and they was jest enough brightness from four five electric lights to show the shape of the square and be reflected from the windows of the closedup stores <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knowed they was likely a watchman somewheres about too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guessed i wouldnt wander around none and run no chances of getting took up by him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i was getting ready to lay down on top of a level pile of boards and go to sleep when i hearn a curious kind of noise a way off like it must be at the edge of town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it sounded like quite a bunch of cattle might shuffling along a dusty road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was so quiet you could hear things plain from a long ways off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it growed a little louder and a little nearer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then it struck a plank bridge somewheres and come acrost it with a clatter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cows and steers dont make that cantering kind of noise as a rule they trot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they was quite a lot of em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they struck the dirt road agin i hearn a shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a dozen all to oncet and away off through the night a woman screamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seen the man in the telephone place fling down his book and grab a pistol from i dont know where <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stepped out into the street and fired three shots into the air as fast as he could pull the trigger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as he done so they was a light flashed out in a build ing way down the railroad track and shots come answering from there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mens voices began to yell out they was the noise of people running along plank sidewalks and windows opening in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with a rush the galloping noise come nearer come closet raced by the place where i was hiding and nigh a hundred men with guns swept right into the middle of that square and pulled their hosses up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seen the feller from the telephone exchange run down the street a little ways as the first rush hit the square and fire his pistol twice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he turned and made fur an alleyway but as he turned they let him have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he throwed up his arms and made one long stagger right acrost the bar of light that streamed out of the windows and he fell into the shadder out of sight jest like a scorched moth drops dead into the dark ness from a torch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of the middle of that bunch of riders come a big voice yelling numbers instead of mens names <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then different crowds lit out in all directions some on foot while others held their hossesfur they seemed to have a plan laid ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hap pened so quick and with such a whirl it was all unreal to meshots and shouts and windows breaking as they blazed away at the store fronts all around the squareand orders and cusswords ringing out between the noise of shootingand those electric lights shining on them as they tossed and trampled and showing up masked faces here and thereand pounding hoofs and hosses scream like humans with excitementand spurts of flame squirted sudden out of the ring of darkness round about the open placeand a bulldog shut up in a store somewheres howling himself hoarse and white puffs of powder smoke like ghosts that went adrifting by the lightsit was all unreal to me as if i had a fever and was dreaming it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that square was like a great big stage in front of me and i laid in the darkness on my lumber pile and watched things like a shownot much scared because it was so derned unreal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from way down along the railroad track they come a sort of blunted roar like blasting big stumps outand then another and another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> purty soon down that way a slim flame licked up the side of a big building there and crooked its tongue over the top <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a second big building right beside it ketched afire and they both showed up in their own light big and angry and handsome and the light showed up the men in front of em too guarding em i guess fur fear the town would get its nerve and make a fight to put em out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i get big im going to run away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he just doesnt know what fun it is to play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see dear when he was a boy like you he had to work oh ever and ever so much more than you doyes he did she nodded solemnly at bills incredulous stare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and his mother never talked with him or held him close as i do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aunt nellie has told me all about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he just worked and worked and workedthey all did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats all there was in their lifejust work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why when he was your age his father was at war and papa and grandmother wade had to do everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did a mans share at fourteen and by the time he was fifteen he ran this whole farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> work has gotten to be a habit with him and its made him different from a great many people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he thinks that is why hes gone ahead and so hes trying to raise you the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he really didnt care about you billy it wouldnt bother him what you did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the silence that fell they could hear old molly bellowing with pathetic monotony for her calf that had been taken from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesterday she had been so proud so happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had had such a hard time bringing it into the world too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin had been obliged to tie a rope to its protruding legs and pull with all his strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it didnt seem fair to think that the trustingeyed little fellow had been snatched from her so soon as if her pain had been an entirely negligible incident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already after six short weeks he was hanging drawn and quartered in one of fallons meatmarkets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all farms are cruel agreed his mother quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people must have milk and they must have veal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at nine though his fingers would become cramped and his wrists would pain him bill had three cows to account for twice a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at five in the morning he would be shaken by martin and told to hurry up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be dark when he stepped out into the chill air and he would draw back with a shiver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somewhere on these six hundred acres was the herd and it was his chore to find it and bring it in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would go struggling through the pasture unable to see twentyfive feet ahead of him the cold dew or snow soaking through his overalls his shoes becoming wet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often he would go a mile north only to have to wander to another end of the farm before he located them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other times when he was lucky they would be waiting within a hundred yards of the barn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how precious the warm bed was and how his growing body craved a few more hours of sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a trick of pulling the sheet up over his head as if thus he could shut out the world but always his father was there to rout him out from this nest and set him none too gently on his feet always there was a herd to be brought in and udders to be emptied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made no difference to martin that the daily walk to and from the district school was long and left no spare time it made no difference that the long hours at his lessons left the boy longing for playalways there was the herd twice a day cows and cows without end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at twelve bill was plowing behind four heavy horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could run a mower and clean a pasture of weeds in a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could cultivate and handle the manure spreader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the hot blazing sun he could shock wheat behind martin who sat on the binder and cut the beautiful swaying gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there wasnt a thing he could not do but there was not one that he did with a willing heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his dreams were all of escape from this grinding harsh farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him that it was as ruthless as his father that everything it demanded of him was at best just a little beyond his strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there was a lever to be pulled on the disk very likely it was rusted and refused to give unless he yanked until he was short of breath and his heart beat fast four horses were so unruly and hard to keep in place the gates were all so heavythey were not easy to lift and then drag open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was such a bitter struggle every step of the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so hard to plow as deeply as he was commanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so wearing to make the seed bed smooth enough to measure up to his fathers standard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never was there a person who saw less to love about a farm than this son of martins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he even ceased to take any interest in the little colts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you used to be foolish about them martin taunted cried whenever i broke one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i dont get to liking em i dont care what happens to em bill answered with his fathers own laconicism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this chickenheartedness as he dubbed it disgusted martin who consequently took a satisfaction in compelling the boy to assist him actively whenever there were cattle to be dehorned wire rings to be pushed through bunches of pigs snouts calves to be delivered by force young stuff to be castrated or butchering to be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often the sensitive lads nerves were strained to the breaking point by the inhuman torture he was constantly forced to inflict upon creatures that had learned to trust him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he does not know whether to rejoice or regret that she does not stir or move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and john as quickly as he could closed up the sepulchre again so that it was not apparent that any one had tampered with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they betook themselves as fast as they could to the tower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they had set her in the tower in the rooms which were beneath the level of the ground they took off her grave clothes and cliges who knew nothing of the potion which she had taken which made her dumb and kept her motionless thinks that she is dead and is in despair with anxiety as he heavily sighs and weeps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but soon the time will come for the potion to lose its force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and fenice who hears his grief struggles and strives for strength to comfort him by word or glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her heart almost bursts because of the sorrow which he shows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says how mean thou art to spare and reprieve all things despicable and vileto let them live on and endure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> art thou beside thyself or drunk who hast killed my lady without me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a marvellous thing i see my lady is dead and i still live on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah precious one why does your lover live to see you dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one now could rightly say that you have died in my service and that it is i who have killed and murdered you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sweetheart then i am the death that has smitten you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it is my own life i have lost in you and have preserved your life in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for did not your health and life belong to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i loved nothing excepting you and our double existence was as one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so now i have done what was right in keeping your soul in my body while mine has escaped from your body and one ought to go to seek the company of the other wherever it may be and nothing ought to separate them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this she heaves a gentle sigh and whispers faintly lover mine i am not altogether dead but very near it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it a jest and a mere pretence but now i am indeed to be pitied for death has not treated this as a jest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be a marvel if i escape alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the doctors have seriously wounded me and broken my flesh and disfigured me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet if it was possible for my nurse to come here and if efforts were of any avail she would restore me to health again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not worry dear about that says cliges for this very night i will bring her here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so john departed and looked for her until he found her and told her how he wished her to come along and to let no other cause detain her for fenice and cliges have sent for her to come to a tower where they are awaiting her and that fenice is in a grievous state so that she must come provided with ointments and remedies and to bear in mind that she will not live long if she does not quickly come to bear her aid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thessala runs at once and taking ointments plaster and remedies which she has prepared she meets john again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> secretly they go out from the city until they come straight to the tower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when fenice sees her nurse she feels already cured because of the loving faith and trust she places in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and cliges greets her affectionately and says welcome nurse whom i love and prize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nurse for gods sake what do you think of this young ladys malady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes my lord have no fear but that i shall restore her completely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fortnight will not pass before i make her so well that she was never before so lively and strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while thessala is busy with her remedies john goes to provide the tower with everything that is necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cliges goes to the tower and comes away bravely and openly for he has lodged a moulting falcon there and he says that he goes to visit it thus no one can guess that he goes there for any other reason than for the falcon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he makes long stays there night and day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he orders john to guard the tower so that no one shall enter against his will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fenice now has no further cause to complain for thessala has completely cured her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if cliges were duke of almeria morocco or tudela he would not consider it all worth a hollyberry compared with the joy which he now feels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly love did not debase itself when it joined these two for it seems to them when they embrace and kiss each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that all the world must be better for their joy and happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ask me no more of this for one can have no wish in which the other does not acquiesce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus they have but one desire as if they two themselves were one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fenice was in the tower i believe all that year and full two months of the next until summer came again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the trees bring forth their flowers and leaves and the little birds rejoice singing gaily their litanies it came about that fenice one morning heard the song of the nightingale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cliges was holding her tightly clasped with his arms about her waist and neck and she held him in a like embrace as she said dear fair lover mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a garden would do me good in which i could disport myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for more than fifteen months i have not seen the light of moon or sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if possible i would fain go out yonder into the daylight for here in this tower i am confined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there was a garden near where i could go and amuse myself it would often do me good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then cliges promises her to consult with john about it as soon as he can see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that very moment john came in as he was often wont to do and cliges spoke to him of what fenice desired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john replies all that she asks for is already provided and supplied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this tower is well equipped with what she wishes and requires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then fenice was very glad and asked john to take her there which he said he would very gladly do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then john goes and opens a door constructed in a fashion which i cannot properly describe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one but john could have made it and no one could have asserted that there was any door or window thereso perfectly was it concealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when fenice saw the door open and the sun come streaming in as she had not seen it for many a day her heart beat high with joy she said that now there was nothing lacking since she could leave her dungeontower and that she wished for no other lodgingplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she passed out through the door into the garden with its pleasures and delights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle of the garden stood a grafted tree loaded with blooming flowers and leaves and with a widespreading top <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the branches of it were so trained that they all hung downwards until they almost touched the ground the main trunk however from which they sprang rose straight into the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath the tree the turf is very pleasant and fine and at noon when it is hot the sun will never be high enough for its rays to penetrate there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john had shown his skill in arranging and training the branches thus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there fenice goes to enjoy herself where they set up a bed for her by day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the garden is enclosed about with a high wall connected with the tower so that nothing can enter there without first passing through the tower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fenice now is very happy there is nothing to cause her displeasure and nothing is lacking which she desires when her lover is at liberty to embrace her beneath the blossoms and the leaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the season when people take the sparrow hawk and setter and hunt the lark and brownthrush or stalk the quail and partridge it chanced that a knight of thrace who was young and alert and inclined to knightly sport came one day close by the tower in his search for game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hawk of bertrand forsuch was his name having missed a lark had flown away and bertrand thought how great his loss would be if he should lose his huntingbird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he saw it come down and light in a garden beneath the tower he was glad for he thought he could not lose it now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once he goes and clambers up the wall until he succeeds in getting over it when beneath the tree he sees fenice and cliges lying asleep and naked in close embrace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he what has happened to me now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is not that the empress with him there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her nose her mouth and brow are like those of my lady the empress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never did nature make two creatures of such similitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no feature in this woman here which i have not seen in my lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she were alive i should say that it was certainly she herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then a pear falls down and strikes close by fenices ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she jumps and awakes and seeing bertrand cries out aloud my dear my dear we are lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he escapes you we are caught in a bad trap for he will tell that he has seen us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then bertrand realised that it was the empress beyond any doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sees the necessity of leaving at once for cliges had brought with him his sword into the garden and had laid it down beside the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he jumped up now and grasped his sword while bertrand hastily took his leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as fast as he could he scaled the wall and was almost safely over when cliges coming after him raised his sword and struck him with such violence that he severed his leg below the knee as if it had been a fennel stalk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of this bertrand got away though badly wounded and maimed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside themselves with grief and wrath at the sight of his sorry state his men on the other side picked him up and insistently inquired who it was who had used him thus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont speak to me now he says but help me to mount my horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no mention shall be made of this excepting to the emperor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he who thus has treated me must be and doubtless is in great terror for he is in great danger of his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they set him upon his palfrey and lead him through the city sorely grieved in their fright the while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after them more than twenty thousand others come following them to the court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the people run together each striving to be there first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertrand made his complaint aloud in the hearing of all to the emperor but they took him for an idle chatterer when he said that he had seen the empress all exposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the city is in a ferment of excitement some regard the news they hear as simple nonsense others advise and urge the emperor to visit the tower himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great is the noise and confusion of the people who prepare to accompany him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they find nothing in the tower for fenice and cliges make their escape taking with them thessala who comforts them and declares to them that if perchance they see people coming after them to arrest them they need have no fear that they would never approach to do them harm within the range of a strong crossbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the emperor within the tower has john sought for and brought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he orders him to be bound and tied saying that he will have him hanged or burnt and will have his ashes scattered wide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shall receive his due reward for the shame he has caused the emperor but this reward will not be agreeable because john has hidden in the tower his nephew with his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon my word you tell the truth says john i will not lie but will go still further and declare the truth and if i have done any wrong it is right that i should be seized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i offer this as my excuse that a servant ought to refuse nothing when his lawful lord commands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now every one knows forsooth that i am his and this tower is too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes after him but neither do i belong to myself nor have i anything which is mine except what he pleased to bestow on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you should think to say that my lord is guilty of having done you wrong i am ready to take up his defence without any command from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i feel emboldened to proclaim openly what is on my mind just as i have thought it out for i know full well that i must die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if i die for my lords sake i shall not die an ignoble death for the facts are generally known about that oath and pledge which you gave to your brother that after you cliges should be emperor who now is banished as a wanderer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if god will he shall yet be emperor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence you are open to reproach for you ought not to have taken a wife yet you married her and did cliges a wrong and he has done you no wrong at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i am punished with death by you and if i die wrongfully for his sake and if he is still alive he will avenge my death on you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now go and do the best you can for if i die you shall also die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the emperor trembles with wrath upon hearing the mocking words addressed to him by john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou shalt have so much respite until we find thy lord who has done such wrong to me though i loved him dearly and had no thought of defrauding him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if thou knowest what has become of him tell me at once i order thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were the life to be drawn from my body i would not reveal my lord to you even if i knew his whereabouts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a matter of fact i do not know any more than you where they have gone so help me god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there is no need for your jealousy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not so much fear your wrath that i should not say so that all can hear how you have been deceived even my words are not believed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were deceived and tricked by potion you drank on your wedding night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unless it happened in dream when you were asleep you have never had your pleasure with her but the night made you dream and the dream gave you as much satisfaction as if it had happened in your waking hours that she had held you in her arms that was the sum of your satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her heart was so devoted to cliges that she feigned death for his sake and he had such confidence in me that he explained it all to me and established her in my house which rightfully belongs to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ought not to find fault with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought indeed to be burnt or hanged were i to betray my lord or refuse to do his will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the emperors attention is recalled to the potion which he had been pleased to drink and with which thessala had deceived him then he realised for the first time that he had never had pleasure with his wife unless it had happened in a dream thus it was but an illusory joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he says that if he does not take vengeance for the shame and disgrace inflicted upon him by the traitor who has seduced his wife he will never again be happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says as far as pavia and from here to germany let no castle town or city remain in which search is not made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will hold that man above all others dear who will bring to me captive the two of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now up and down near and far go diligently and search <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they started out with zeal and spent all that day in the search <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the number cliges had some friends who if they found them would have led them to some hidingplace rather than hale them back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that fortnight they exhausted themselves in a fruitless search <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for thessala who is acting as their guide conducts them by her arts and charms in such security that they feel no dread or fear of all the strength of the emperor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seek repose in no town or city yet they have all they wish or desire even more so than is usually the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all they need is procured for them by thessala who searches and scours and purveys for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor is there any who hunts them now for all have returned to their homes again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile cliges is not idle but starts to find his uncle king arthur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he continued his search until he found him and to him he made his claim and protest about his uncle the emperor who in order to disinherit him had disloyally taken a wife which it was not right for him to do for he had sworn to his father that he would never marry in his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the king says that with a fleet he will proceed to constantinople and that he will fill a thousand ships with knights and three thousand more with menatarms until no city or burg town or castle however strong or however high will be able to withstand their assault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then cliges did not forget to thank the king for the aid he offered him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king sends out to seek and summon all the high barons of the land and causes to be requisitioned and equipped ships war vessels boats and barks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has a hundred ships loaded and filled with shields lances bucklers and armour fit for knights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king makes such great preparations for the war that never did caesar or alexander make the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he orders to assemble at his summons all england and all flanders normandy france and brittany and all the men as far as the pyrenees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already they were about to set sail when messengers arrived from greece who delayed the embarkation and kept the king and his people back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the messengers who came was john that trusty man for he would never be a witness or messenger of any news which was not true and which he did not know for a certainty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the messengers were high born men of greece who came in search for cliges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they made inquiry and asked for him until they found him at the kings court when they said to him god save you sire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and constantinople is given to you by all those of your empire because of the right you have to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your uncle but you know it not is dead of the grief he felt because he could not discover you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his grief was such that he lost his mind he would neither drink nor eat but died like a man beside himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all your lords have sent for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greatly they desire and long for you wishing to make you their emperor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some there were that rejoiced at this and others there were who would have gladly seen their guests elsewhere and the fleet make sail for greece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the expedition is given up and the king dismisses his men and the hosts depart to their homes again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and cliges hurriedly makes haste in his desire to return to greece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his preparations made he took his leave of the king and then of all his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and taking fenice with him he goes away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he possessed all the disposition to deceive but wanted the power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having no resources within himself he was com pelled to be the copyist of many and being such he was forever the victim of inconsistency and of con sequence he was an object of contempt and was held as such even by his slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the luxury of having slaves of his own to wait upon him was something new and unprepared for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a slaveholder with out the ability to hold slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found himself in capable of managing his slaves either by force fear or fraud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we seldom called him master we gen erally called him captain auld and were hardly disposed to title him at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making him appear awkward and of consequence fretful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our want of reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wished to have us call him master but lacked the firmness necessary to command us to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife used to insist upon our calling him so but to no purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in august my master attended a methodist campmeeting held in the bayside tal bot county and there experienced religion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i in dulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead him to emancipate his slaves and that if he did not do this it would at any rate make him more kind and humane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was disappointed in both these re spects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it neither made him to be humane to his slaves nor to emancipate them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it had any effect on his character it made him more cruel and hateful in all his ways for i believe him to have been a much worse man after his conversion than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prior to his conversion he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him in his savage barbarity but after his conversion he found religious sanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he very soon distinguished himself among his brethren and was soon made a classleader and exhorter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his activity in revivals was great and he proved himself an instrument in the hands of the church in converting many souls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up for while he starved us he stuffed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have had three or four preachers there at a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the names of those who used to come most frequently while i lived there were mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we believed him to be a good man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we thought him instrumental in get ting mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samuel harrison a very rich slaveholder to emancipate his slaves and by some means got the impression that he was laboring to effect the emanci pation of all the slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he was at our house we were sure to be called in to prayers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the others were there we were sometimes called in and sometimes not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cookman took more notice of us than either of the other ministers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not come among us without betraying his sympathy for us and stupid as we were we had the sagacity to see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while i lived with my master in st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> michaels there was a white young man a mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wilson who proposed to keep a sabbath school for the instruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the new testament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fairbanks both classleaders with many others came upon us with sticks and other missiles drove us off and forbade us to meet again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus ended our little sabbath school in the pious town of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have said my master found religious sanction for his cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as an example i will state one of many facts going to prove the charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen him tie up a lame young woman and whip her with a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders causing the warm red blood to drip and in justification of the bloody deed he would quote this passage of scripturehe that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> master would keep this lacerated young woman tied up in this horrid situation four or five hours at a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that doesnt prove that the play out in front isnt beautiful and affecting and all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it only shows that everything in this world is produced by machineryby organization <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trouble is that youve been let in on the stage behind the scenes so to speak and youre so green if youll pardon methat you want to sit down and cry because the trees are cloth and the moon is a lantern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i say dont be such a goose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see what you mean theron said with an answering smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added more gravely all the same the winch business seems to me now the winch business is my own affair sister soulsby broke in abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you simply voted as you did on the merits of the case as he presented them thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something had occurred to him and he knitted his brows to follow its course of expansion in his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you arranged with winch to make those bogus offers just to lead others on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sister soulsbys large eyes beamed down upon him in reply at first in open merriment then more soberly till their regard was almost pensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us talk of something else she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has nothing to do with you anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got some advice to give you about keeping up this grip youve got on your people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young minister had risen to his feet while she spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put his hands in his pockets and with rounded shoulders began slowly pacing the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a turn or two he came to the desk and leaned against it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i doubt if its worth while going into that he said in the solemn tone of one who feels that an irrevocable thing is being uttered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i shall go awaygive up the ministry he added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sister soulsbys eyes revealed no such shock of consternation as he unconsciously had looked for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they remained quite calm and when she spoke they deepened to fit her speech with what he read to be a gaze of affectionate melancholy one might say pity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nodont let any one else hear you say that she replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my poor young friend its no good to even think it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the real wisdom is to school yourself to move along smoothly and not fret and get the best of whats going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive known others who felt as you doof course there are times when every young man of brains and high notions feels that waybut theres no help for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who tried to get out only broke themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who stayed in and made the best of itwell one of them will be a bishop in another ten years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he snapped out at her over his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id rather earn the meanest living at an honest trade and be free from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it isnt a question of what youd rather do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what trade or business do you suppose you could take up now and get a living out of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this view of his capabilities came upon him with the force and effect of a blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont discover myself he began stumblingly that im so conspicuously inferior to the men i see about me who do make livings and very good ones too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course youre not she replied with easy promptness youre greatly the other way or i shouldnt be taking this trouble with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youre what you are because youre where you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment you try on being somewhere else youre done for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all this world nobody else comes to such unmerciful and universal grief as the unfrocked priest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know a catholic priest he said irrelevantly who doesnt believe an atom inin things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you dont hear him talking about going and earning his living ill bet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or if he does he takes powerful good care not to go all the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they know how to allow for the machinery behind the scenes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its all so different urged the young minister the same things are not expected of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i sat the other night and watched those people you got up around the altarrail groaning and shouting and crying and the others jumping up and down with excitement and sister lovejoydid you see her?coming out of her pew and regularly waltzing in the aisle with her eyes shut like a whirling dervishi positively believe it was all that made me ill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just put a good face on it and make up your mind to get through by treading on as few corns as possible and keeping your own toes well in and youll be surprised how easy itll all come to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that exemplifies just what i was sayingits a part of our machinery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now a church is like everything elseits got to have a boss a head an authority of some sort that people will listen to and mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their church is chuckfull of authorityall the way from the pope down to the priestand accordingly they do as theyre told <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the protestantsyour methodists most of allthey say no we wont have any authority we wont obey any boss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we who are responsible for running the thing and raising the money and so onwe have to put on a spurt every once in a while and work up a general state of excitement and while its going dont you see that that is the authority the motive power whatever you like to call it by which things are done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we do and thats why weve got it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he moved about again his bowed face drawn as with bodily suffering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel as if i could never so much as look at these people here again without disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh now thats where you make your mistake sister soulsby put in placidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these people of yours are not a whit worse than other people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyve got their good streaks and their bad streaks just like the rest of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take them by and large theyre quite on a par with other folks the whole country through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe theres another congregation in the conference wherewhere this sort of thing would have been needed or i might say tolerated insisted theron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps youre right the other assented but that only shows that your people here are different from the others not that theyre worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont seem to realize octavius so far as the methodists are concerned is twenty or thirty years behind the times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that has its advantages and its disadvantages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the church here is tough and coarse and full of grit like a grindstone and it does ministers from other more niminypiminy places all sorts of good to come here once in a while and rub themselves up against it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it scours the rust and mildew off from their piety and they go back singing and shouting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of course its had a different effect with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre razorsteel instead of scythesteel and the grindings been too rough and violent for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these people here really take their primitive methodism seriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to them the profession of entire sanctification is truly a genuine thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well dont you see when people just know that theyre saved it doesnt seem to them to matter so much what they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they feel that ordinary rules may well be bent and twisted in the interest of people so supernaturally good as they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theron paused in his walk to look absently at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that thought he said in a vague slow way seems to be springing up in my path whichever way i turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it oppresses me and yet it fascinates methis idea that the dead men have known more than we know done more than we do that there is nothing new anywhere that never mind the dead men interposed sister soulsby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hate to have you straddling about the room when im trying to talk to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theron obeyed and as he sank into the low seat sister soulsby drew up her chair and put her hand on his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her gaze rested upon his with impressive steadiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now i want to talk seriously to you as a friend she began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mustnt breathe to any living soul the shadow of a hint of this nonsense about leaving the ministry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see how you were feelingi saw the book you were reading the first time i entered this roomand that made me like you only i expected to find you mixing up more worldly gumption with your renan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well perhaps i like you all the better for not having itfor being so delightfully fresh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate that made me sail in and straighten your affairs for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now for gods sake keep them straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just put all notions of anything else out of your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> watch your chief men and women and be friends with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep your eye open for what they think you ought to do and do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have your own ideas as much as you like read what you like say damn under your breath as much as you like but dont let go of your job <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive knocked about too much and ive seen too many promising young fellows cut their own throats for pure moonshine not to have a right to say that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theron could not be insensible to the friendly hand on his shoulder or to the strenuous sincerity of the voice which thus adjured him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he said vaguely smiling up into her earnest eyes if we agree that it is moonshine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she exclaimed with renewed animation patting his shoulder in a brisk automatic way to point the beginnings of her confidences ill tell you something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got a religion of my own and its got just one plank in it and that is that the time to separate the sheep from the goats is on judgment day and that it cant be done a minute before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young minister took in the thought and turned it about in his mind and smiled upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that brings me to what im going to tell you sister soulsby continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she leaned back in her chair and crossed her knees so that one wellshaped and artistically shod foot poised itself close to therons hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes dwelt upon his face with an engaging candor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began life she said as a girl by running away from a stupid home with a man that i knew was married already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that i supported myself for a good many yearsgenerally at first on the stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been a frontranker in amazon ballets and ive been leading lady in comic opera companies out west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive told fortunes in one room of a miningcamp hotel where the biggest game of faro in the territory went on in another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been a professional clairvoyant and ive been a professional medium and ive been within one vote of being indicted by a grand jury and the money that bought that vote was put up by the smartest and most famous traingambler between omaha and frisco a gentleman who died in his boots and took three sheriffs deputies along with him to kingdomcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theron looked earnestly at her and said nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i take it for granted theres a good deal that he has never felt called upon to mention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hasnt what you may call a talkative temperament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there is also a good deal that i do know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes been an actor too and to this day id back him against edwin booth himself to recite clarences dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hes been a medium and then he was a travelling phrenologist and for a long time he was advance agent for a british blondes show and when i first saw him he was lecturing on female diseases and he had his little turn with a grand jury too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact he was what you may call a regular bad old rooster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gentleman of a somewhat foreign and somewhat military air yet closely shaven and wearing a soft hat desired in the politest terms to visit the apartments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had he explained a friend a gentleman in tender health desirous of a sedate and solitary life apart from interruptions and the noises of the common lodginghouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the unusual clause he continued in your announcement particularly struck me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i said is the place for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> concluded the visitor looking keenly in and these observed the other taking a side glance through the open door of the diningroom which they were then passing these are some of your works <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he again and still more sharply peered into the somerset unable to suppress a blush made the more haste to excellent observed the stranger as he looked from one of the back windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friend will take your drawingroom floor he will sleep in the back drawingroom his nurse an excellent irish widow will attend on all his wants and occupy a garret he will pay you the round sum of ten dollars a week and you on your part will engage to receive no other lodger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somerset had scarcely words in which to clothe his gratitude agreed said the other and to spare you trouble my friend will bring some men with him to make the changes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will find him a retiring inmate sir receives but few and rarely leaves the house except at night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since i have been in this house returned somerset i have myself unless it were to fetch beer rarely gone abroad except in the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a man he added must have some amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an hour was then agreed on the gentleman departed and somerset sat down to compute in english money the value of the figure named <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result of this investigation filled him with amazement and disgust but it was now too late nothing remained but to endure and he awaited the arrival of his tenant still trying by various arithmetical expedients to obtain a more favourable quotation for the dollar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the approach of dusk however his impatience drove him once more to the front balcony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night fell mild and airless the lamps shone around the central darkness of the garden and through the tall grove of trees that intervened many warmly illuminated windows on the farther side of the square told their tale of white napery choice wine and genial hospitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stars were already thickening overhead when the young mans eyes alighted on a procession of three fourwheelers coasting round the garden railing and bound for the superfluous mansion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were laden with formidable boxes moved in a military order one following another and by the extreme slowness of their advance inspired somerset by the time he had the door open the cabs had drawn up beside the pavement and from the two first there had alighted the military gentleman of the morning and two very stalwart porters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these proceeded instantly to take possession of the house with their own hands and firmly rejecting somersets assistance they carried in the various crates and boxes with their own hands dismounted and transferred to the back drawingroom the bed in which the tenant was to sleep and it was not until the bustle of arrival had subsided and the arrangements were complete that there descended from the third of the three vehicles a gentleman of great stature and broad shoulders leaning on the shoulder of a woman in a widows dress and himself somerset had but a glimpse of him in passing he was soon shut into the back drawingroom the other men departed silence redescended on the house and had not the nurse appeared a little before halfpast ten and with a strong brogue asked if there were a decent publichouse in the neighbourhood somerset might have still supposed himself to day followed day and still the young man had never come by speech or sight of his mysterious lodger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doors of the drawingroom flat were never open and although somerset could hear him moving to and fro the tall man had never quitted the privacy of his apartments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> visitors indeed arrived sometimes in the dusk sometimes at intempestuous hours of night or morning men for the most part some meanly attired some decently some loud some cringing and yet all in the eyes of somerset displeasing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain air of fear and secrecy was common to them all they were all voluble he thought and ill at ease even the military gentleman proved on a closer inspection to be no gentleman at all and as for the doctor who attended the sick man his manners were not suggestive of a university career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nurse again was scarcely a desirable housefellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since her arrival the fall of whisky in the young mans private bottle was much accelerated and though never communicative she was at times unpleasantly familiar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when asked about the patients health she would dolorously shake her head and yet somehow somerset had early begun to entertain the notion that his complaint was other than bodily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the illlooking birds that gathered to the house the strange noises that sounded from the drawingroom in the dead hours of night the careless attendance and intemperate habits of the nurse the entire absence of correspondence the entire seclusion of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jones himself whose face up to that hour he could not have sworn to in a court of justice all weighed unpleasantly upon the young mans mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sense of something evil irregular and underhand haunted and depressed him and this uneasy sentiment was the more firmly rooted in his mind when in the fulness of time he had an opportunity of observing the features of his tenant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young landlord was awakened about four in the morning by a noise in the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leaping to his feet and opening the door of the library he saw the tall man candle in hand in earnest conversation with the gentleman who had taken the rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the faces of both were strongly illuminated and in that of his tenant somerset could perceive none of the marks of disease but every sign of health energy and resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he was still looking the visitor took his departure and the invalid having carefully fastened the front door that night upon his pillow somerset began to kindle once more into the hot fit of the detective fever and the next morning resumed the practice of his art with careless hand and an abstracted mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day was destined to be fertile in surprises nor had he long been seated at the easel ere the first of these occurred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cab laden with baggage drew up before the door and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> luxmore in person rapidly mounted the steps and began to pound upon the knocker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear fellow she said with the utmost gaiety here i come dropping from the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am delighted to find you faithful and i have no doubt you will be equally pleased to be restored to liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somerset could find no words whether of protest or welcome and the spirited old lady pushed briskly by him and paused on the threshold of the diningroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight that met her eyes was one well calculated to inspire astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queen fixed her gaze upon a plump young maiden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her victim tried to turn away hiding her face in her hands and kneeling behind a woman but the reptile with unblinking eyes stared on with such fixity that i could have sworn her vision penetrated the woman and the girls arms to reach at last the very center of her brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly the reptiles head commenced to move to and fro but the eyes never ceased to bore toward the frightened girl and then the victim responded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned wide fearhaunted eyes toward the mahar queen slowly she rose to her feet and then as though dragged by some unseen power she moved as one in a trance straight toward the reptile her glassy eyes fixed upon those of her captor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the waters edge she came nor did she even pause but stepped into the shallows beside the little island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on she moved toward the mahar who now slowly retreated as though leading her victim on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water rose to the girls knees and still she advanced chained by that clammy eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the water was at her waist now her armpits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her fellows upon the island looked on in horror helpless to avert her doom in which they saw a forecast of their own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mahar sank now till only the long upper bill and eyes were exposed above the surface of the water and the girl had advanced until the end of that repulsive beak was but an inch or two from her face her horrorfilled eyes riveted upon those of the reptile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the water passed above the girls mouth and noseher eyes and forehead all that showedyet still she walked on after the retreating mahar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queens head slowly disappeared beneath the surface and after it went the eyes of her victimonly a slow ripple widened toward the shores to mark where the two vanished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time all was silence within the temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mahars watched the surface of the water for the reappearance of their queen and presently at one end of the tank her head rose slowly into view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was backing toward the surface her eyes fixed before her as they had been when she dragged the helpless girl to her doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then to my utter amazement i saw the forehead and eyes of the maiden come slowly out of the depths following the gaze of the reptile just as when she had disappeared beneath the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on and on came the girl until she stood in water that reached barely to her knees and though she had been beneath the surface sufficient time to have drowned her thrice over there was no indication other than her dripping hair and glistening body that she had been submerged at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again and again the queen led the girl into the depths and out again until the uncanny weirdness of the thing got on my nerves so that i could have leaped into the tank to the childs rescue had i not taken a firm hold of myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once they were below much longer than usual and when they came to the surface i was horrified to see that one of the girls arms was gonegnawed completely off at the shoulderbut the poor thing gave no indication of realizing pain only the horror in her set eyes seemed intensified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next time they appeared the other arm was gone and then the breasts and then a part of the faceit was awful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor creatures on the islands awaiting their fate tried to cover their eyes with their hands to hide the fearful sight but now i saw that they too were under the hypnotic spell of the reptiles so that they could only crouch in terror with their eyes fixed upon the terrible thing that was transpiring before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally the queen was under much longer than ever before and when she rose she came alone and swam sleepily toward her bowlder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment she mounted it seemed to be the signal for the other mahars to enter the tank and then commenced upon a larger scale a repetition of the uncanny performance through which the queen had led her victim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the women and children fell prey to the maharsthey being the weakest and most tenderand when they had satisfied their appetite for human flesh some of them devouring two and three of the slaves there were only a score of fullgrown men left and i thought that for some reason these were to be spared but such was far from the case for as the last mahar crawled to her rock the queens thipdars darted into the air circled the temple once and then hissing like steam engines swooped down upon the remaining slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no hypnotism herejust the plain brutal ferocity of the beast of prey tearing rending and gulping its meat but at that it was less horrible than the uncanny method of the mahars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time the thipdars had disposed of the last of the slaves the mahars were all asleep upon their rocks and a moment later the great pterodactyls swung back to their posts beside the queen and themselves dropped into slumber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought the mahars seldom if ever slept i said to ja <end> <end> 
<start> <start> renwick told me also that it was the first public action that his hand was at to conveen friends and lift their murthered bodies and carried them to the west churchyard of edinburgh not greyfriars this time and buried them there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they came about the city and took down these five heads and that hand and day being come they went quickly up the pleasaunce and when they came to lauristoun yards upon the southside of the city they durst not venture being so light to go and bury their heads with their bodies which they designed it being present death if any of them had been found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexander tweedie a friend being with them who at that time was gardner in these yards concluded to bury them in his yard being in a box wrapped in linen where they lay years except days being executed upon the th of october and found the th day of october that piece of ground lay for some years unlaboured and trenching it the gardner found them which affrighted him the box was consumed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> schaw the owner of these yards caused lift them and lay them upon a table in his summerhouse mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> schaws mother was so kind as to cut out a linencloth and cover them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they lay twelve days there where all had access to see them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexander tweedie the foresaid gardner said when dying there was a treasure hid in his yard but neither gold nor silver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> daniel tweedie his son came along with me to that yard and told me that his father planted a white rosebush above them and farther down the yard a red rosebush which were more fruitful than any other bush in the yard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many came to see the heads out of curiosity yet i rejoiced to see so many concerned grave men and women favouring the dust of our martyrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were six of us concluded to bury them upon the nineteenth day of october and every one of us to acquaint friends of the day and hour being wednesday the day of the week on which most of them were executed and at of the clock at night being the hour that most of them went to their resting graves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we caused make a compleat coffin for them in black with four yards of fine linen the way that our martyrs corps were managed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> accordingly we kept the aforesaid day and hour and doubled the linen and laid the half of it below them their nether jaws being parted from their heads but being young men their teeth remained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then emma for three months after our marriage will you try being just mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean no factory no featherlooms no dictation no business bothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her voice was a rising scale of surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just try it for three months with the privilege of a lifetime if you like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iid like to see you there when i leave emma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id like to have you there when i come home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i sound like a selfish turk but you sound like a regular husband emma mcchesney had interrupted and i love you for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for three whole months im going to be what the yellow novels used to call a dollwife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to meet you at the door every night with a rose in my hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall wear pink things with lace ruffles on em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you know that ive been longing to do just those things for years and years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to blossom out into a beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill hold shades of yellow and green and fleshcolor up to my face to see which brings out the right tints <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to gaze at myself through halfclosed eyes to see which shade produces tawny lights in my hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever since i can remember ive been so busy that it has been a question of getting the best possible garments in the least possible time for the smallest possible sum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive worn blue serge until it feels like a convicts uniform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to blossom out into fawn and green and mauve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall get evening dresses with only bead shoulderstraps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never really seen fifth avenue between eleven and one when the real people come out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my views of it have been at nine am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the officeworkers are going to work and at five thirty when they are going home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will now cease to observe the proletariat and mingle with the predatory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill probably go in for those tiffin things at the plaza <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i do ill never be the same woman again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take fencing lessons if you want to or sanskrit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve been a queen bee for so many years that i think the role of drone will be a pleasant change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me shoulder the business worries for a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for three months i shall do nothing more militant than to pick imaginary threads off your coat lapel and pout when you mention business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of those three months well go into private session compare notes and determine whether the plan shall cease or become permanent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they did so a faint shadow of doubt hovered far far back in the depths of t <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a faint inscrutable smile lurked in the corners of emmas lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it was that emma mcchesney the alert the capable the brisk the businesslike assumed the role of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she who formerly at eleven in the morning might have been seen bent on selling the best possible bill of spring featherlooms to joe greenbaum of keokuk iowa could now be found in a modistes grayandraspberry salon being draped and pinned and fitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she whose dynamic force once charged the entire office and factory with energy and efficiency now distributed a tithe of that priceless vigor here a tithe there a tithe everywhere and thus broke the very backbone of its power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had never been a woman to do things by halves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what she undertook to do she did thoroughly and wholeheartedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this principle she applied to her new mode of life as rigidly as she had to the old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emma was too much a woman not to feel a certain exquisite pleasure in the selecting of delicate and becoming fabrics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a thrill of novelty in being able to spend an hour curled up with a book after lunch to listen to music one afternoon a week to drive through the mistily gray park to walk up the thronged sparkling avenue pausing before its aladdins cave windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> simple enough pleasures and taken quite as a matter of course by thousands of other women who had no workfilled life behind them to use as contrast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a velvet affair with furs and gratifyingly becoming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her shining blond head rose above the soft background of velvet and fur with an effect to distract the least observing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had asked buck turning slowly frankly sure of herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say emma wheres that blue thing you used to wearthe one with the white cuffs and collar and the little blue hat with the whatchamacallems on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in order to camp said he the first thing we need is tents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will some one please lend me a handkerchief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shaggy man offered him one and aunt em another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took them both and laid them carefully upon the grass near to the edge of the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he laid his own handkerchief down too and standing a little back from them he waved his left hand toward the handkerchiefs tents of canvas white as snow let me see how fast you grow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the handkerchiefs became tiny tents and as the travelers looked at them the tents grew bigger and bigger until in a few minutes each one was large enough to contain the entire party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this said the wizard pointing to the first tent is for the accommodation of the ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorothy you and your aunt may step inside and take off your things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every one ran to look inside the tent and they saw two pretty white beds all ready for dorothy and aunt em and a silver roost for billina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rugs were spread upon the grassy floor and some camp chairs and a table completed the furniture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this beats anything i ever saw or heard of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed aunt em and she glanced at the wizard almost fearfully as if he might be dangerous because of his great powers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a trick glinda the sorceress taught me and it is much better magic than i used to practice in omaha or when i first came to oz he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the good glinda found i was to live in the emerald city always she promised to help me because she said the wizard of oz ought really to be a clever wizard and not a humbug <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we have been much together and i am learning so fast that i expect to be able to accomplish some really wonderful things in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but come and see the mens tent said the wizard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they went to the second tent which had shaggy edges because it has been made from the shaggy mans handkerchief and found that completely furnished also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it contained four neat beds for uncle henry omby amby the shaggy man and the wizard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also there was a soft rug for toto to lie upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third tent explained the wizard is our dining room and kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they visited that next and found a table and dishes in the dining tent with plenty of those things necessary to use in cooking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wizard carried out a big kettle and set it swinging on a crossbar before the tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he was doing this omby amby and the shaggy man brought a supply of twigs from the forest and then they built a fire underneath the kettle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now dorothy said the wizard smiling i expect you to cook our supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there is nothing in the kettle she cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt see anything put in and im almost sure it was empty when you brought it out she replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless said the little man winking slyly at uncle henry you will do well to watch our supper my dear and see that it doesnt boil over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the men took some pails and went into the forest to search for a i believe the wizard is fooling us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw the kettle myself and when he hung it over the fire there wasnt a thing in it but air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont worry remarked billina confidently as she nestled in the grass before the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll find something in the kettle when its taken offand it wont be poor innocent chickens either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your hen has very bad manners dorothy said aunt em looking somewhat disdainfully at billina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems too bad she ever learned how to talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there might have been another unpleasant quarrel between aunt em and billina had not the men returned just then with their pails filled with clear sparkling water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wizard told dorothy that she was a good cook and he believed their supper was ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so uncle henry lifted the kettle from the fire and poured its contents into a big platter which the wizard held for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the platter was fairly heaped with a fine stew smoking hot with many kinds of vegetables and dumplings and a rich delicious gravy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wizard triumphantly placed the platter upon the table in the dining tent and then they all sat down in camp chairs to the feast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were several other dishes on the table all carefully covered and when the time came to remove these covers they found bread and butter cakes cheese pickles and fruitsincluding some of the luscious strawberries of oz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one ventured to ask a question as to how these things came there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they contented themselves by eating heartily the good things provided and toto and billina had their full share you may be sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the that may have been magic food my dear and for that reason perhaps it wont be very nourishing but im willing to say it tasted as good as anything i ever et <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she added in a louder voice whos going to do the dishes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ejaculated the good lady holding up her hands in amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for sure enough when she looked at the dishes they had a moment before left upon the table she found them all washed and dried and piled up into neat stacks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> till i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice of forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conjectureaye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at allyour real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a wordmiss fairfax said something about conjecturing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bates of restoring your spectacles healed for the present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last nightlet me live them over again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you did not enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds all the worlds one ever has to givefor another halfhour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte here is something quite new to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here are a new set of irish melodies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that from such a quarter one might expect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not it?he knew miss fairfax could have no music here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her.this amiable upright perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she does wrong she ought to feel it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is not entirely without it i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not see much sign of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is playing robin adair at this momenthis favourite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window descried mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knightley i declare!i must speak to him if possible just to thank him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not open the window here it would give you all cold but i can go into my mothers room you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite delightful to have you all meet so!our little room so honoured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knightleys attention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how d ye do?how dye do?very well i thank you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so obliged to you for the carriage last night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were just in time my mother just ready for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knightley seemed determined to be heard how is your niece miss bates?i want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how is miss fairfax?i hope she caught no cold last night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston gave emma a look of particular meaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so obliged to you!so very much obliged to you for the carriage resumed miss bates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do put up your horse at the crown and come in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said he in a deliberating manner for five minutes perhaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must get on to kingston as fast as i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will be so very happy to see you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will call another day and hear the pianoforte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knightley what a delightful party last night how extremely pleasant.did you ever see such dancing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank churchill i never saw any thing equal to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very delightful indeed i can say nothing less for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think miss fairfax dances very well and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston is the very best countrydance player without exception in england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return but i cannot stay to hear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knightley one moment more something of consequence so shocked!jane and i are both so shocked about the apples <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to think of your sending us all your store apples <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said you had a great many and now you have not one left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should not have done it indeed you should not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i thought he would have staid now and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well returning to the room i have not been able to succeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked me if he could do any thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have heard every thing to be sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can i do any thing for you at kingston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss woodhouse must you be going?you seem but just comeso very obliging of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emma found it really time to be at home the visit had already lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston and her companion taking leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be possible to do without dancing entirely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instances have been known of young people passing many many months successively without being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue either to body or mindbut when a beginning is made when the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly feltit must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again and the last halfhour of an evening which mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> franks was the first idea and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank churchill and miss woodhouse dancedfor doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfaxand even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aids of vanityto assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to holdand then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> coles should be finished therethat the same party should be collected and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five had been repeated many times over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes that will be quite enough for pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but will there be good room for five couple?i really do not think there will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will not do to invite five couple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brothers and must be invited with the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had been asked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a word was put in for a second young cox and at last mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston naming one family of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> might not they use both rooms and dance across the passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston was in distress about the supper and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not bear it for emma!emma is not strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray do not let them talk of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew the importance of it and said every thing in her power to do it away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every door was now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again and with such goodwill on frank churchills part that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be a crowda sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very true he gravely replied it was very bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still he i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no said she you are quite unreasonable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be dreadful to be standing so close <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowdand a crowd in a little room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a crowd in a little roommiss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exquisite quite exquisite!still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be a disappointment to my fatherand altogetheri do not know thati am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little selfwilled and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had she intended ever to marry him it might have been worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference and the character of his temper but for all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have struck a jarring note at the first night of hernani <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was trying to account for its wrongness when soames suddenly and strangely broke silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall not be here i briskly but fatuously added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he droned but the museum will still be just where it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and people will be able to go and read there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he inhaled sharply and a spasm as of actual pain contorted his features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered what train of thought poor soames had been following <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not enlighten me when he said after a long pause you think i havent minded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my people said he addressing those present with kindness and dignity it seems to me fitting that a handsome king should be handsomely attired and an ugly one clothed simply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for years i have been so terrible in feature that i dared not even look at my own image in a mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now thanks to the gracious magic of my guest i have become like other men and hereafter you will find my rule as kind as it was formerly cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tonight in honor of this joyous occasion we shall feast and make merry and it is my royal command that you all do honor and reverence to the illustrious prince marvel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a loud shout of approval greeted this speech and the evening was merry indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> terribus joined freely in the revelry laughing as gaily as the lightesthearted damsel present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was nearly morning before they all retired and as they sought their beds nerle asked the prince in a voice that sounded like an why did you give the king beauty after his treatment of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marvel looked at the reproachful face of his esquire and smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you are older said he you will find that often there are many ways to accomplish a single purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kings ugliness was the bar to our leaving his country for he feared our gossip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the easiest way for us to compass our escape was to take away his reason for detaining us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus i conquered the king in my own way and at the same time gained his gratitude and friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will he allow us to depart in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was late when they rose from their slumbers but having breakfasted the princes first act was to seek the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we wish to leave your kingdom said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> terribus grasped the hand of his guest and pressed it with fervor while tears of gratitude stood in his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should prefer that you remain with me always and be my friend he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you choose to leave me i shall not interfere in any way with your wishes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prince marvel looked at him thoughtfully and then said my time on this island is short <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few months prince marvel will have passed out of the knowledge of men and his name will be forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before then i hope to visit the kingdoms of dawna and auriel and plenta so i must not delay but beg you will permit me to depart at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come with me and i shall show you the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he led the prince and nerle to a high wall of rock and placing his hand upon its rough surface touched a hidden spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly an immense block of stone began to swing backward disclosing a passage large enough for a man on horseback to ride through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the one road that leads out of my kingdom said terribus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others all begin and end at the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that unless you know the secret of this passage you could never escape from spor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the kingdom of auriel which you desire to visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not a straight road for it winds around the land of twi so it will carry you a little out of your way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a small country hidden from the view of all travelers said terribus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one has ever yet found a way to enter the land of twi yet there is a rumor that it is ruled by a mighty personage called the high ki <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and does the rumor state what the high ki of twi is like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no indeed returned the king smiling so it will do you no good to be curious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now farewell and may good luck attend you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet bear in mind the fact that king terribus of spor owes you a mighty debt of gratitude and if you ever need my services you have but to call on me and i shall gladly come to your assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thank you said marvel but there is small chance of my needing help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farewell and may your future life be pleasant and happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps you would like to know my friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked appalled by the detailed finish of the dark plot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lent me my good man not given me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> met me taking the air last evening and being as usual anxious to oblige hadnt you better go to the devil out of my compound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and upon this without other warning he let fly with the banana which missed my head and took the constable just under the left eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rushed at the miserable johnson stammering with fury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but why dwell on the wretched ness the breathlessness the degradation the sense lessness the weariness the ridicule and humiliation andandthe perspiration of these moments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems he had been greatly annoyed at losing his free afternoon on my account <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gar den of his bungalow required his personal atten tion and at the slight blow of the banana the brute in him had broken loose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we left johnson on his back still black in the face but beginning to kick feebly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime the big woman had remained sitting on the ground apparently paralysed with extreme terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for half an hour we jolted inside our rolling box side by side in profound silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the exser geant was busy staunching the blood of a long scratch on his cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what comes of all that tomfool business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you hadnt quarrelled with that tugboat skipper over some girl or other all this wouldnt have happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i shouldnt wonder if the consulgeneral himself doesnt come to hear of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how am i to go before him tomorrow with that thing on my cheeki want to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its you who ought to have got this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that till the gharry stopped and he jumped out without leavetaking he swore to him self steadily horribly muttering great purpose ful trooper oaths to which the worst a sailor can do is like the prattle of a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my part i had just the strength to crawl into schombergs coffee room where i wrote at a little table a note to the mate instructing him to get everything ready for dropping down the river next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a clever sort of skip per and no mistakepoor thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times the obviousness of my innocence would reduce me to despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had done something to bring about the situation i should at least have learned not to do it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i felt guiltless to the point of imbecility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room was empty yet only schomberg prowled round me goggleeyed and with a sort of awed respectful cu riosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to prove to you that we already know all about it i inclose herewith a list and description of all the ships you have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great and good friend was so struck by the hard sense of the letter that he kept his navy at home and saved one thousand million dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this economy enabled him to buy a satisfactory decision when the cause of the quarrel was submitted to arbitration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two footpads sat at their grog in a roadside resort comparing the evenings adventures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood up the chief of police said the first footpad and i got away with what he had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i said the second footpad stood up the united states district attorney and got away with good lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interrupted the other in astonishment and admiration you got away with what that fellow had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no the unfortunate narrator explained with a small part of what i had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the civil war a patriot was passing through the state of maryland with a pass from the president to join grants army and see the fighting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stopping a day at annapolis he visited the shop of a wellknown optician and ordered seven powerful telescopes one for every day in the week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in recognition of this munificent patronage of the states languishing industries the governor commissioned him a colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a negro in a boat gathering driftwood saw a sleeping alligator and thinking it was a log fell to estimating the number of shingles it would make for his new cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having satisfied his mind on that point he stuck his boathook into the beasts back to harvest his good fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon the saurian emerged from his dream and took to the water greatly to the surprise of the man andbrother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never befo seen such a cyclone as dat he exclaimed as soon as he had recovered his breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it done carry away de ruf of my house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a great expenditure of life and treasure a daring explorer had succeeded in reaching the north pole when he was approached by a native galeut who lived there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im very glad to see you but why did you come here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes yes i know the other persisted but of what benefit to man is your discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to what truths does it give access which were inaccessible before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be tom scatted if i know the great man replied frankly you will have to ask the scientist of the expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the scientist of the expedition explained that he had been so engrossed with the care of his instruments and the study of his tables that he had found no time to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder at your impudence speaking to persons of our quality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was right said he they are great chiefs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i was a tadpole i had no tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look up my little ones there is no danger near look up and welcome thistle to our home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the little buds raised their rosy faces danced again upon their stems and nodded kindly at thistle who smiled on them through happy tears and kissed the sweet forgiving rose who loved and trusted him when most forlorn and friendless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if roseleaf is his friend surely we may be yet still i fear he may soon grow weary of this gentleness and be again the wicked fairy he once was and we shall suffer for our kindness to him now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried warmhearted little mignonette surely some good spirit has changed the wicked thistle into this good little elf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see how tenderly he lifts aside the leaves that overshadow pale harebell and listen now how softly he sings as he rocks little eglantine to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has done many friendly things though none save roseleaf has been kind to him and he is very sad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last night when i awoke to draw my curtains closer he sat weeping in the moonlight so bitterly i longed to speak a kindly word to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they all said little mignonette was right and spreading wide their leaves they bade him come and drink their dew and lie among the fragrant petals striving to cheer his sorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thistle told them yes we will help you to find the earth spirits for you are striving to be good and for love of lilybell we will do much for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they called a little brighteyed mole and said downyback we have given you a pleasant home among our roots and you are a grateful little friend so will you guide dear thistle to the earth spirits home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> downyback said yes and thistle thanking the kindly flowers followed his little guide through long dark galleries deeper and deeper into the ground while a glowworm flew before to light the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on they went and after a while reached a path lit up by bright jewels hung upon the walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here downyback and glimmer we can lead you no farther you must now go on alone and the music of the spirits will guide you to their home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they went quickly up the winding path and thistle guided by the sweet music went on alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he soon reached a lovely spot whose golden halls were bright with jewels which sparkled brightly and threw manycolored shadows on the shining garments of the little spirits who danced below to the melody of soft silvery bells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long thistle stood watching the brilliant forms that flashed and sparkled round him but he missed the flowers and the sunlight and rejoiced that he was not an earth spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last they spied him out and gladly welcoming him bade him join in their dance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but thistledown was too sad for that and when he told them all his story they no longer urged but sought to comfort him and one whom they called little sparkle for her crown and robe shone with the brightest diamonds said you will have to work for us ere you can win a gift to show the brownies do you see those golden bells that make such music as we wave them to and fro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we worked long and hard ere they were won and you can win one of those if you will do the task we give you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thistle said no task will be too hard for me to do for dear lilybells sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> halfway down the ladder it all but escaped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cyril just caught it by its spout and as nearly as possible lost his footing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was trembling and pale when at last they reached the bottom of the winding stair and stepped out on to the flags of the churchporch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly the keeper caught cyril and robert each by an arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you bring along the gells sir said he you and andrew can let go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we havent hurt you just come along said the keeper and cyril dared not oppose him with violence because just then the syphon began to slip again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they were all marched into the vicarage study and the vicars wife came rushing in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and please were very late and theyll be anxious at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could you or perhaps theres a hotel near where we could get a carriage the vicar had sunk into a chair overcome by emotion and amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cyril had also sat down and was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees because of that sodawater syphon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how did you come to be locked up in the churchtower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went up said robert slowly and we were tired and we all went to sleep and when we woke up we found the door was locked so i should think you did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frightening everybody out of their wits like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ought to be ashamed of we are said jane gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know at all said robert with perfect truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do please well really said the vicar i suppose wed better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> andrew not alone i dont said andrew to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the vicar went on let this be a lesson to you he went on talking and the children listened miserably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew all about poachers of course so he knew how people look when theyre hiding something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vicar had just got to the part about trying to grow up to be a blessing to your parents and not arst him what hes got there under his jacket and cyril knew that concealment was at an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he stood up and squared his shoulders and tried to look noble like the boys in books that no one can look in the face of and doubt that they come of brave and noble families and will be faithful to the death and he pulled out there was a silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cyril went on there was nothing else for yes we took this out of your larder and some chicken and tongue and bread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were very hungry and we didnt take the custard or jam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we only took bread and meat and water and we couldnt help its being the soda kind just the necessaries of life and we left halfacrown to pay for it and we left a letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and my father will pay a fine or anything you like but dont send us to prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know what you said about not being a disgrace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well dont you go and do it however did you get up to the larder window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell you that said cyril firmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is this the whole truth youve been telling me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no answered jane suddenly its all true but its not the whole truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh do forgive us and take us home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ran to the vicars wife and threw her arms round her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vicars wife put her arms round theyre all right sir i expect its a pal theyre standing by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me said the vicar kindly are you screening someone else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said anthea thinking of the psammead but it wasnt their very well my dears said the vicar then lets say no more i dont know said cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see anthea wrote it in such a hurry and it really didnt seem like stealing then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but afterwards when we found we couldnt get down off the churchtower it seemed just exactly like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the iceman had a fair vocabulary but it lacked pliancy seemed stiff and fastidious compared with the flexible saxon in which hedrick sketched a family tree lacking perhaps some plausibility as having produced even an iceman but curiously interesting zoologically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came home at noon with the flush of this victory new upon his brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt equal to anything and upon coras appearing at lunch with a blithe bright air and a new arrangement of her hair he opened a fresh campaign with illomened bravado <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he inquired in allusion to a symmetrical and becoming undulation upon each side of her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too bad ray vilas cant come any more hed like those i know he would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cora who was talking jauntily to her mother went on without heeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she affected her enunciation at times with a slight lisp spoke preciously and overexquisitely purposely mincing the letter r at the same time assuming a manner of artificial distinction and conscious elegance which never failed to produce in her brother the last stage of exasperation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear mamma you should but have seen her delight when she saw me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was but just returned from bar harbor bawhawbaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had no idea she should find me in town she said cora ran on happily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she came back early on account of the children having to be sent to school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has such adorable childrenbeautiful dimpled babes slush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and her dear son egerton villard hes grown to be such a comely lad and he has the most charming courtly manners he helped his mother out of her carriage with all the air of a man of the world and bowed to me as to a duchess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think he might be a great influence for good if the dear villards would but sometimes let him associate a little with our unfortunate hedrick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> egerton villard is really distingue he has a beautiful head and if he could be induced but to let hedrick follow him about but a little ill beat his beautiful head off for him if he but butts in on me but a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think if i were really an idiot id be even fonder of you than i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a panic he sat waiting he knew not what but cora blandly resumed her interrupted remarks to her mother beginning a description of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> villards dress laura was talking unconcernedly to miss peirce no one appeared to be aware that anything unusual had been said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his breath came back and summoning his presence of mind he found himself able to consider his position with some degree of assurance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps after all coras retort had been merely a coincidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went over and over it in his mind making a pretence meanwhile to be busy with his plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for that one word he could have decided that her remark was a coincidence but really was ominous had a sinister ring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly the pleasant clouds that had obscured his memory of the fatal evening were swept away as by a monstrous hand it all came back to him with sickening clearness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so is it always with the sinner with his sin and its threatened discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again in his miserable mind he sat beside lolita on the fence with the moon shining through her hair and he knewfor he had often read itthat a man could be punished his whole life through for a single moments weakness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man might become rich great honoured and have a large family but his one soft sin would follow him hunt him out and pull him down at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did that relentless comanche cora know this thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he fell back upon his faith in providence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heaven would not let the world be so bad as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet it did sometimes become negligenthe remembered the case of a babygirl cousin who fell into the bathtub and was drowned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> providence had allowed that what assurance had he that it would not go a step farther <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why hedrick said cora turning toward him cheerfully youre not really eating anything youre only pretending to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> school begins so soon you must be strong you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how we shall miss you here at home during your hours of work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with that the burden fell from his shoulders his increasing terrors took wing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if laura had told his ghastly secret to cora the latter would not have had recourse to such weak satire as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cora was not the kind of person to try a popgun on an enemy when she had a thirteeninch gun at her disposal so he reasoned and in the gush of his relief and happiness responded youre a little too cocky lately coralee i wish you were my daughterjust about five minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would you do to me she inquired with a terrible sweetnessdarling little boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blow was square in the face it jarred every bone the world seemed to topple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother rising from her chair choked slightly and hurried to join the nurse who was already on her way upstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cora sent an affectionate laugh across the table to her stunned antagonist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im almost sure you wouldnt not if i asked you to kiss me some more all doubt was gone the last hope fled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a vision of the awful future flamed across his staggered mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doors to the arena were flung open the wild beasts howled for hunger of him the spectators waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear would thou wert near to hear me tell how fair thou art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since thou art gone i mourn all alone oh my lolita she broke off to explain its one of those passionate little spanish serenades hedrick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill sing it for your boyfriends next time they come to play in the yard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they know why you like it so much im sure they will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course you do like ityou roguish little lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darling little boy the oh my lolita come to my heart oh come beloved love let me press thee while i caress thee in one long kiss lolita <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me hedrick sprang to his feet with a yell of agony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laura madison you tattletale he bellowed ill never forgive you as long as i live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill get even with you if it takes a thousand years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like a sporting man who thriving in middle age endeavors to live down his shady past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fanny discovered cottage grove avenue and halsted street and jefferson and south state where she should never have walked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is an ugliness about chicagos ugly streets that for sheer naked brutality is equaled nowhere in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they are ugly as crime is uglyand as fascinating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is like the ugliness of an old hag who has lived a life and who could tell you strange tales if she would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> walking through them you think of fagin of children of the ghetto of tales of mean streets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naples is honeycombed with narrow teeming alleys grimed with the sediment of centuries colored like old stilton and smelling much worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but where is there another cottage grove avenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a street of flatwheeled cars of delicatessen shops and moving picture houses of clanging bells of frowsy women of men who dart around corners with pitchers their coat collars turned up to hide the absence of linen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day fanny found herself at fiftyfirst street and there before her lay washington park with its gracious meadow its italian garden its rose walk its lagoon and drooping willows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the illinois central railroad puffed contemptuous cinders into the great blue lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and almost in the shadow of the city hall nestled bathhouse johns groggery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was a street developing before ones eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to walk on it was like being present at a birth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is one of the few streets in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> new york has two paris a hundred london none vienna one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> berlin before the war knew that no one walked unter den linden but american tourists and german shopkeepers from the provinces with their fat wives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this michigan boulevard unfinished as chicago itself shifting and changing daily still manages to take on a certain form and rugged beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as you turn into it from the crash and thunder of wabash there comes to you a sense of peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the sweep of it and the lake just beyond for michigan avenue is a oneside street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its west side is a sheer mountain wall of office buildings clubs and hotels whose ground floors are fascinating with specialty shops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a milliner tantalizes the passerby with a single hat stuck knowingly on a carved stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an art store shows two etchings and a vase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a jewelers window holds square blobs of emeralds on velvet and perhaps a gold mesh bag sprawling limp and invertebrate or a diamond and platinum la valliere chastely barbaric <end> <end> 
<start> <start> past these windows from randolph to twelfth surges the crowd matinee girls all white fox and giggles and orchids wiseeyed saleswomen from the smart specialty shops dressed in next weeks mode art students hugging their precious flat packages under their arms immigrants in corduroys and shawls just landed at the twelfth street station sightseeing families dazed and weary from kansas tailored and sabled lake shore drive dwellers convention delegates spilling out of the auditorium hotel redfaced hoarse with satin badges pinned on their coats and their hats the wrong kind stuck far back on their heads music students to whom michigan avenue means the fine arts building <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but just across the street the walk is as deserted as though a pestilence lurked there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the art institute rears its smokeblackened face and grant parks greenery struggles bravely against the poisonous breath of the illinois central engines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just below twelfth street block after block shows the solid plate glass of the automobile shops their glittering wares displayed against an absurd background of oriental rugs tiffany lamps potted plants and mahogany <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the windows pose the salesmen no less sleek and glittering than their wares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just below these for a block or two rows of sinister looking houses fallen into decay with slatternly women lolling at their windows and gas jets flaring blue in dim hallways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> below eighteenth still another change where the fat stone mansions of chicagos old families save the marguerite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you know that women buyers for mail order houses do not spend their saturday afternoons and sundays thus prowling about a citys streets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fanny brandeis knew it too in her heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew that the ella monahans of her world spent their holidays in stayless relaxation manicuring mending a bit skimming the sunday papers massaging crowsfeet somewhat futilely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew that women buyers do not as a rule catch their breath with delight at sight of the pock marked old field columbian museum in jackson park softened and beautified by the kindly gray chiffon of the lake mist and tinted by the rouge of the sunset glow so that it is a thing of spectral loveliness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> successful mercantile women seeing the furnace glare of the south chicago steel mills flaring a sullen red against the lowering sky do not draw a disquieting mental picture of men toiling there naked to the waist and glistening with sweat in the devouring heat of the fires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose she said it was the citys appeal to the country dweller but she lied and she knew she was lying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must have known it was the spirit of molly brandeis in her and of molly brandeis mother and of her mothers mothers mother down the centuries to sarah repressed women suffering women troubled patient nomadic women struggling now in her for expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and fanny brandeis went doggedly on buying and selling infants wear and doing it expertly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so likely to be littered with the most appealing bits of apparela pair of tiny crocheted bootees pink and white a sturdy linen smock a silken hood so small that ones doubled fist filled it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fanny had slaved over it hampered by slosson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fenger had given her practically a free hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> results would not come in for many days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the christmas trade would not tell the tale for that was always a time of abnormal business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dull season following the holiday rush would show the real returns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his attitude was not resentful it was pitying and that frightened fanny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wished that he would storm a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she read her department catalogue proof sheets and these reassured her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the new baby book had turned out very well with a colored cover that would appeal to any one who had ever been or seen a baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a letter from theodore meant just one thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while she hesitated the old struggle would rage in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont owe him anything the thing within her would say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what have i done all my life but give and give and give to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let him work with his hands as i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless she had sent him one thousand of the six thousand her mother had bequeathed to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now as she held this last letter in her hands and stared he wants something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i send him some i cant have that new tailor suit or the furs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olga and i are back in munich as you see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think well be here all winter though olga hates it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it isnt vienna but i think theres a chance for a class here of american pupils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> munichs swarming with americanswhole families who come here to live for a year or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i might get together a very decent class backed by auers recommendations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but auer is planning a series of twenty concerts for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ought to be a success if slaving can do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i worked six hours a day all summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to spend the summermost of it that isin holzhausen am ammersee which is a little village or artists colony in the valley an hours ride from here and within sight of the bavarian alps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had kurt steins little villa for almost nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but olga was bored and she wasnt well poor girl so we went to interlaken and it was awful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that brings me to what i want to tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no use saying im glad because im not and neither is olga <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olga has been simply wretched but the doctor says shell feel better from now on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth of it is she needs a lot of things and i cant give them to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you id been working on this concerto of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i think its the real thing if only i could get the leisure and the peace of mind i need to work on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know what it means to be eaten up with ambition and to be handicapped oh dont i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said fanny brandeis between her teeth and crumpled the letter in her strong fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she got up from her chair and began to walk up and down her little office up and down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man often works off his feelings thus a woman rarely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fenger who had not been twice in her office since her coming to the haynescooper plant chose this moment to visit her his hands full of papers his head full of plans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sensed something wrong at once as a highly organized human instrument responds to a similarly constructed one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fenger saw the letter crushed in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had told him about theodore and he had been tremendously interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but you know your salarys going up after christmas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know that haynescooper isnt exactly a philanthropic institution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a salary raise here usually means a battle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us hope hell conduct himself more creditably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he added well what is it this morning mordaunt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mordaunt had expected but he hesitated a second before he began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is higgins he said higgins of edge farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was ill himself last autumn and his children had scarlet fever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant say that he is a very good manager but he has had illluck and of course he is behindhand in many ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is in trouble about his rent now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newick tells him if he doesnt pay it he must leave the place and of course that would be a very serious matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife is ill and he came to me yesterday to beg me to see about it and ask you for time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thinks if you would give him time he could catch up again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all think that said the earl looking rather black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been standing between his grandfather and the visitor listening with all his might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had begun to be interested in higgins at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered how many children there were and if the scarlet fever had hurt them very much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes were wide open and were fixed upon mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mordaunt with intent interest as that gentleman went on with the conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> higgins is a wellmeaning man said the rector making an effort to strengthen his plea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a bad enough tenant replied his lordship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he is always behindhand newick tells me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is in great trouble now said the rector <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is very fond of his wife and children and if the farm is taken from him they may literally starve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can not give them the nourishing things they need <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two of the children were left very low after the fever and the doctor orders for them wine and luxuries that higgins can not afford <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the way with michael he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forgot we had a philanthropist in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the gleam of queer amusement came back into the old mans deepset eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was bridgets husband who had the fever answered fauntleroy and he couldnt pay the rent or buy wine and things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you gave me that money to help him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl drew his brows together into a curious frown which somehow was scarcely grim at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what sort of landed proprietor he will make he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told havisham the boy was to have what he wantedanything he wantedand what he wanted it seems was money to give to beggars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were splendid bricklayers and bootblacks and applewomen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he bent his gaze on the boy for a few seconds in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact was that a new thought was coming to him and though perhaps it was not prompted by the noblest emotions it was not a bad thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fauntleroy went and stood as near to him as possible without encroaching on the gouty foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mordaunt experienced for the moment a curious sensation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being a man of great thoughtfulness and having spent so many years on the estate of dorincourt knowing the tenantry rich and poor the people of the village honest and industrious dishonest and lazy he realized very strongly what power for good or evil would be given in the future to this one small boy standing there his brown eyes wide open his hands deep in his pockets and the thought came to him also that a great deal of power might perhaps through the caprice of a proud selfindulgent old man be given to him now and that if his young nature were not a simple and generous one it might be the worst thing that could happen not only for others but for himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what would you do in such a case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fauntleroy drew a little nearer and laid one hand on his knee with the most confiding air of good comradeship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were very rich he said and not only just a little boy i should let him stay and give him the things for his children but then i am only a boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then after a seconds pause in which his face brightened visibly you can do anything cant you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean you can give any one anything said fauntleroy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is my agent answered the earl and some of my tenants are not overfond of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you going to write him a letter now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall i bring you the pen and ink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can take the game off this table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it plainly had not for an instant occurred to him that newick would be allowed to do his worst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl paused a moment still looking at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply wonder at him said the governor who was very pleased with stepan and spoke kindly of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has now been with us about two months and could be held up as a model of good behaviour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am afraid he is plotting some mischief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a daring man and exceptionally strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the first month in prison stepan suffered from the same agonising vision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the grey wall of his cell he heard the sounds of the prison the noise of the cell below him where a number of convicts were confined together the striking of the prison clock the steps of the sentry in the passage but at the same time he saw her with that kindly face which conquered his heart the very first time he met her in the street with that thin stronglymarked neck and he heard her soft lisping pathetic voice to destroy somebodys soul and worst of all your own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a while her voice would die away and then black faces would appear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would appear whether he had his eyes open or shut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with his closed eyes he saw them more distinctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he opened his eyes they vanished for a moment melting away into the walls and the door but after a while they reappeared and surrounded him from three sides grinning at him and saying over and over make an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stepan shook all over when he heard that and tried to say all the prayers he knew our lady or our father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in saying his prayers he began to recollect his whole life his father his mother the village the dog wolf the old grandfather lying on the stove the bench on which the children used to play then the girls in the village with their songs his horses and how they had been stolen and how the thief was caught and how he killed him with a stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he recollected also the first prison he was in and his leaving it and the fat innkeeper the carters wife and the children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then again she came to his mind and again he was terrified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> throwing his prison overcoat off his shoulders he jumped out of bed and like a wild animal in a cage began pacing up and down his tiny cell hastily turning round when he had reached the damp walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more he tried to pray but it was of no use now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one evening when the wind whistled and howled in the pipes stepan after he had paced up and down his cell for a long time sat down on his bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt he could not struggle any more the black demons had overpowered him and he had to submit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some time he had been looking at the funnel of the oven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he could fix on the knob of its lid a loop made of thin shreds of narrow linen straps it would hold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he would have to manage it very cleverly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he set to work and spent two days in making straps out of the linen bag on which he slept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the guard came into the cell he covered the bed with his overcoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tied the straps with big knots and made them double in order that they might be strong enough to hold his weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during these preparations he was free from tormenting visions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the straps were ready he made a slipknot out of them and put it round his neck stood up in his bed and hanged himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the very moment that his tongue began to protrude the straps got loose and he fell down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor was called in stepan was brought to the infirmary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day he recovered and was removed from the infirmary no more to solitary confinement but to share the common cell with other prisoners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the common cell he lived in the company of twenty men but felt as if he were quite alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not notice the presence of the rest did not speak to anybody and was tormented by the old agony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt it most of all when the men were sleeping and he alone could not get one moment of sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> continually he saw her before his eyes heard her voice and then again the black devils with their horrible eyes came and tortured him in the usual way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he again tried to say his prayers but just as before it did not help him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day when after his prayers she was again before his eyes he began to implore her dear soul to forgive him his sin and release him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards morning when he fell down quite exhausted on his crushed linen bag he fell asleep at once and in his dream she came to him with her thin wrinkled and severed neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with her mild eyes and did not answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she did not say a word and he awoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that time onwards he suffered less and seemed to come to his senses looked around him and began for the first time to talk to the other men in the cell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stepans cell was shared among others by the former yardporter vassily who had been sentenced to deportation for robbery and by chouev sentenced also to deportation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vassily sang songs the whole day long with his fine voice or told his adventures to the other men in the cell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chouev was working at something all day mending his clothes or reading the gospel and the psalter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stepan asked him why he was put into prison and chouev answered that he was being persecuted because of his true christian faith by the priests who were all of them hypocrites and hated those who followed the law of christ <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stepan asked what that true law was and chouev made clear to him that the true law consists in not worshipping gods made with hands but worshipping the spirit and the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told him how he had learnt the truth from the lame tailor at the time when they were dividing the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what will become of those who have done evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scriptures give an answer to that said chouev and read aloud to him matthew xxv <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson most of them indeed were those which i had before understood but i profited by the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as night came on agatha and the arabian retired early <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ardently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning felix went out to his work and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sang and her voice flowed in a rich cadence swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> safie was always gay and happy she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods the sun became warmer the nights clear and balmy and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight fearful of meeting with the same treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than the arabian who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while i improved in speech i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the book from which felix instructed safie was volneys ruins of empires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix in reading it given very minute explanations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had chosen this work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the different nations of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard of the slothful asiatics of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the grecians of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early romansof their subsequent degeneratingof the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared the lowest degradation a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian the strange system of human society was explained to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the words induced me to turn towards myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was besides endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome i was not even of the same nature as man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame my stature far exceeded theirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me i tried to dispel them but sorrow only increased with knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh that i had forever remained in my native wood nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger thirst and heat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain and that was deatha state which i feared yet did not understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers but i was shut out from intercourse with them except through means which i obtained by stealth when i was unseen and unknown and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard of the difference of sexes and the birth and growth of children how the father doted on the smiles of the infant and the lively sallies of the older child how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge of brother sister and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was purely the manner of the curates advances that took my fancy in the mere fact of them there was nothing remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all the men in the house and a good many outside made covert stealthy and indirect steps in the same direction for trix as her friends called her was if not wise at least pretty and witty displaying to the material eye a charming figure and to the mental a delicate heartlessnessboth attributes which challenge a selfrespecting mans best efforts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from heiresses in reason a gentleman need neither shrink nor let himself be driven but when it comes to something like twenty thousand a yearthe reported amount of trixs dothe distrusts his own motives almost as much as the ladys relatives distrust them for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all felt thisstanton rippleby and i and although i will not swear that we spoke no tender words and gave no meaning glances yet we reduced such concessions to natural weakness to a minimum not only when lady queenborough was by but at all times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to say truth we had no desire to see our scalps affixed to miss trixs pretty belt nor to have our hearts broken like that of the young man in the poem before she went to homburg in the autumn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hejack ives by the way was his nameappeared to rush not only upon his fate but in the face of all possibility and of lady queenborough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my cousin and hostess dora polton was very much distressed about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said that he was such a nice young fellow and that it was a great pity to see him preparing such unhappiness for himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay i happen to know that she spoke very seriously to trix pointing out the wickedness of trifling with him whereupon trix who maintained a bowing acquaintance with her conscience avoided him for a whole afternoon and endangered all algy stantons prudent resolutions by taking him out in the canadian canoe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this demonstration in no way perturbed the curate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he observed that as there was nothing better to do we might as well play billiards and proceeded to defeat me in three games of a hundred up no it is quite immaterial whether we played for anything or not after which he told dora that the vicar was taking the evening serviceit happened to be the day when there was one at the parish churcha piece of information only relevant in so far as it suggested that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ives could accept an invitation to dinner if one were proffered him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack ives airily remarking that there was no use in ceremony among friends seized the place next to trix at dinner her mother was just opposite and walked on the terrace after dinner with her in the moonlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the ladies retired he came into the smoking room drank a whisky and soda said that miss queenborough was really a very charming companion and apologized for leaving us early on the ground that his sermon was still unwritten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my good cousin the squire suggested rather grimly that a discourse on the vanity of human wishes might be appropriate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this resolution he carried out on the next day but one that being a sunday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had the pleasure of sitting next to miss trix and i watched her with some interest as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not try to reproduce the sermon which would have seemed by no means a bad one had any of our party been able to ignore the personal application which we read into it for its main burden was no other than thisthat wealth should be used by those who were fortunate enough to possess it here trix looked down and fidgeted with her prayerbook as a means of promoting greater union between themselves and the less richly endowed and notas alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had too often been the caseas though it were a new barrier set up between them and their fellowcreatures here miss trix blushed slightly and had recourse to her smellingbottle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said the curate waxing rhetorical as he addressed an imaginary but bloated capitalist have no more right to your money than i have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is intrusted to you to be shared with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this point i heard lady queenborough sniff and algy stanton snigger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stole a glance at trix and detected a slight waver in the admirable lines of her mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said to her as we walked home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ireland has the greenest grass and trees the finest stones and lakes and theyve jauntingcars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know just exactly what they are but ireland has all there are anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyve a lot of great actors and a few singers and there never was a sweeter poet than one of theirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should hear my father recite dear harp of my country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the angel arose made an elaborate oldtime bow and holding up the banjo recited in clipping feet and meter with rhythmic swing and the cold chain of silence had hung oer thee long she muted the then proudly my own irish harp i unbound thee she threw up her and gave all thy chords to light freedom and song she crashed into the notes of the accompaniment she had been playing for freckles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what you want to be thinking of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not darkness and lonesomeness and sadness but light freedom and song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant begin to think offhand of all the big splendid things an irishman has to be proud of but whatever they are they are all yours and you are a part of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you go over there and do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ireland has had her statesmen warriors actors and poets now you be her voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you stand right out there before the cathedral door and im going to come down the aisle playing that accompaniment and when i stop in front of youyou sing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes were flashing and she was palpitating with earnestness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently before he saw she was there she was coming down the aisle toward him playing compellingly and rifts of light were touching her with golden glory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cathedral was majestically beautiful from arched dome of frescoed gold green and blue in neverending shades and harmonies to the mosaic aisle she trod richly inlaid in choicest colors and gigantic pillars that were gods handiwork fashioned and perfected through ages of sunshine and rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the fair young face and divinely molded form of the angel were his most perfect work of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was smiling encouragingly now and as she came toward him she struck the chords full and strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heart of poor freckles almost burst with dull pain and his great love for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his desire to fulfill her expectations he forgot everything else and when she reached his initial chord he three little leaves of irish green united on one stem love truth and valor do they mean they form a magic gem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the angels eyes widened curiously and her lips parted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was too young to know that in the effort to rouse a man women frequently kindle fires that they neither can quench nor control <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freckles was looking over her head now and singing that song as it never had been sung before for her alone and instead of her helping him as she had intended he was carrying her with him on the waves of his voice away away into another world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he struck into the chorus wideeyed and panting she was swaying toward him and playing with all her might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh say you love you love the shamrock green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the last note freckles voice ceased and he looked at the angel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had given his best and his all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell on his knees and folded his arms across his breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the angel as if magnetized walked straight down the aisle to him and running her fingers into the crisp masses of his red hair tilted his head back and laid her lips on his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said in a voice that wavered from the throbbing of her shaken heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freckles when you go into the world if you can face a big audience and sing like that just once you will be immortal and anything you want will be yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freckles arose muttered something and catching up his old bucket plunged into the swamp blindly on a pretence of bringing water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the angel walked slowly across the study sat on the rustic bench and through narrowed lids intently studied the tip of her shoe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the trail the bird woman wheeled to mclean with a dumbfounded look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think the angel knew she did that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bird woman stared across the gently waving swale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see how i am going to blame her she said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its so exactly what i would have done myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was born a gentleman conceded the bird woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever that kiss meant to him he recognized that it was the loving impulse of a child under stress of strong emotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was fine and manly as any man ever could have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you he said simply and parted the bushes for her to enter freckles room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before she left she sent for her cameras and made studies of each side of it and of the cathedral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was entranced with the delicate beauty of the place while her eyes kept following freckles as if she could not believe that it could be his conception and work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bird woman had brought a lunch and they spread it with freckles dinner on the study floor and sat resting and enjoying themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the angel put her banjo into its case silently gathered her music and no one mentioned the concert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bird woman left mclean and the angel to clear away the lunch and with freckles examined the walls of his room and told him all she knew about his shrubs and flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she analyzed a cardinalflower and showed him what he had wanted to know all summerwhy the bees buzzed ineffectually around it while the hummingbirds found in it an everready feast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of his specimens were so rare that she was unfamiliar with them and with the flower book between them they knelt studying the different varieties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wandered the length of the cathedral aisle with him and it was at her suggestion that he lighted his altar with a row of flaming foxfire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as freckles came to the cabin from his long day at the swamp he saw mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chicken sweeping to the south and wondered where she was going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stepped into the bright cosy little kitchen and as he reached down the washbasin he asked mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so warm a wave swept her heart that a halfflush mantled her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she straightened her shoulders and glanced at her hands tenderly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least the anes ye get from people ye love dinna <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they strike in until they find the center of your heart and make their stoppingplace there and naething can take them from yei doubt if even deathna lad ye can be reet sure kisses dinna wash off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwardwell there would be time to decide when he had his five thousand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sent her a note asking her to meet him in tompkins square on friday evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolved that the scene between her and him should be so far as his part was concerned a masterpiece of that art of which he knew himself to be one of the greatest living exponents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only his own elegant languor had prevented the universal recognition of this and his triumph over the envy of professionals and the venality of critics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a concert night in tompkins square and hilda off from her work for an hour came alone through the crowds to meet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made no effort to control the delight in her eyes and in her voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she loved him not because he was her conquest but because she was his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> feuerstein was so absorbed in his impending act that he barely noted how pretty she was and how utterly in lovewhat was there remarkable in a woman being in love with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the women are all crazy about me was his inward comment whenever a woman chanced to glance at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he took hildas hand he gave her a look of intense yearning melancholy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he glanced gloomily round and sighed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seated themselves on a bench far away from the music and the crowds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not speak but repeated his deep sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has it made you worse to come dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah child you do not know what suffering isyou who have lived only in these simple hilda was trembling with apprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must take my dark shadow from your young life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i love you carl she said gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed hildas heart seemed to stand still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was pale to the lips and he could see even in the darkness her eyes grow and startle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know ican bear anything not that tone he groaned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be he felt her hand become cold and he saw terror in her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what to say or do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he noted with artistic satisfaction that the band was playing passionate lovemusic with sobs and sad ecstasies of farewell embraces in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temptations must come into the world but woe to him by whom she listened and looked at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly she heard the sound of something dripping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked down and saw that blood was flowing from his hand and down his cassock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she remembered the sound she had heard and seizing the little lamp ran out into the porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there on the floor she saw the bloody finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she returned with her face paler than his and was about to speak to him but he silently passed into the back cell and fastened the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dressed hurriedly and silently and when ready sat waiting in her furs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snapped my friend in that tone of authority which he knew so well how to assume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> skirting sculleries kitchens laundries and enginerooms he led us through those mysterious labyrinths which have no existence for the guest above but which contain the machinery that renders these modern khans the aladdins palaces they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a secondfloor landing we met a man in a tweed suit to whom our cicerone presented us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man regarded us haughtily with a suspicious smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre not from scotland yard at any rate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> smith pulled out a card and thrust it into the speakers hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are the hotel detective he said take us without delay to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a marked change took place in the others demeanor on glancing at the card in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me sir he said deferentially but of course i didnt know who i was speaking to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all have instructions to give you every assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes been in his room for some time sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will want to get there without being seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can join the lift on the third floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you noticed anything suspicious about the place tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that accounts for your finding me where you did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but about eleven oclock when the theater people began to come in i had a hazy sort of impression that someone or something slipped past in the crowdsomething that had no business in the hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you thought you saw something entering you must have formed a more or less definite impression regarding it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the funny part of the business answered the man doggedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as i stood at the top of the stairs i could have sworn that there was something crawling up behind a party two ladies and two gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it didnt strike me as being a dog sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyway when the party passed me there was nothing there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mind you whatever it was it hadnt come in by the front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have made inquiries everywhere but without result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> came a muffled voice what do you want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stay right there where you can watch the stairs and the lift he instructed and note everyone and everything that passes this door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but whatever you see or hear do nothing without my orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man moved off and the door was opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> graham guthrie british resident in north bhutan was a big thickset mangrayhaired and florid with widely opened eyes of the true fighting blue a bristling mustache and prominent shaggy brows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nayland smith introduced himself tersely proffering his card and an open letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guthrie he said so no doubt you will realize that the business which brings me and my friend dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petrie here at such an hour is of the first importance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no time for ceremony he explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at halfpast an attempt will be made upon your life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> smith said the other who arrayed in his pajamas was seated on the edge of the bed you alarm me very greatly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may mention that i was advised of your presence in england this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know anything respecting the person called fumanchudr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only what i was told todaythat he is the agent of an advanced political group <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is opposed to his interests that you should return to bhutan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore unless you implicitly obey my instructions you will never leave england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was growing more used to the gloom and i could dimly discern him his face turned towards nayland smith whilst with his hand he clutched the bedrail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a visit as ours i think must have shaken the nerve of any man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> smith he said surely i am safe enough here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place is full of american visitors at present and i have had to be content with a room right at the top so that the only danger i apprehend is that of fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact that you are at the top of the building enhances that danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you recall anything of the mysterious epidemic which broke out in rangoon in the deaths due to the call of siva <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i read of it in the indian papers said guthrie uneasily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from what i recall of the cases said guthrie that seems impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in several instances the victims threw themselves from the windows of locked roomsand the windows were quite inaccessible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exactly replied smith and in the dim light his revolver gleamed dully as he placed it on the small table beside the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> except that your door is unlocked the conditions tonight are identical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it struck the halfhour leaving the stillness complete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that room high above the activity which yet prevailed below high above the supping crowds in the hotel high above the starving crowds on the embankment a curious chill of isolation swept about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again i realized how in the very heart of the great metropolis a man may be as far from aid as in the heart of a desert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was glad that i was not alone in that roommarked with the deathmark of fumanchu and i am certain that graham guthrie welcomed his unexpected company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may have mentioned the fact before but on this occasion it became so peculiarly evident to me that i am constrained to record it here i refer to the sense of impending danger which invariably preceded a visit from fumanchu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even had i not known that an attempt was to be made that night i should have realized it as strung to high tension i waited in the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some invisible herald went ahead of the dreadful chinaman proclaiming his coming to every nerve in ones body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like a breath of astral incense announcing the presence of the priests of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wail low but singularly penetrating falling in minor cadences to a new silence came from somewhere close at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that we were three that the hotel detective was within hail that there was a telephone in the room that the traffic of the embankment moved almost beneath us but i knew and am not ashamed to confess that king fear had icy fingers about my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paced up and down smiling to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he drew up before her tossing his hands out as if to throw away some pleasant dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have come to you gracious lady as i would to the mother of miss dunbar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before i address her it is necessary that i shall consult her guardian with regard to business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was precisely clara said afterward as if the baker from weir had stopped singing and presented his bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont have such things in the states <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i quite understand all those european social traits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat down by the table and took out a notebook and papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gentle ladies even die amerikaner do not comprehend business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not you perceive dear lady the same when the head of the house of wolfburgh allies himself with a hochgeboren fraulein as when the tailors marry nor bakers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her estate in delaware glancing at his notebook is larger than some of our german kingdoms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her investments in railway and mining securities if put on the market should be worth a million of florins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are solid matters and must be dealt with carefully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried miss vance how did you find out about lucys investments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not possible that you supposed that in such a matter as this men leap into the darkthe men of rank princes counts english barons who marry the american mees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that they do not know for what they exchange theirall that they give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell you with a condescending smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are agents in the statesin new yorkin chicagoinhow do you name it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they furnish exact information as to the dot of the lady who will perhaps marry here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and may i inquire your highness what financial arrangement you propose in case she becomes your wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this must be accepted by her guardian before the betrothal can take place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole estate passes to me and is secured to me in case of my wifes death without issue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i inserted that clause he said looking up smiling for approval because american frauleins are so fragilenot like our women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will of course if we have issue try to preserve the real estate for my heir and the remaining property for my other children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me that a good deal is taken for granted there said clara whose cheeks were very hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and where does miss dunbar come into this arrangement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is she not to have any money at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my widow should i die first will be paid an annuity from my estate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while mees lucy is my wife i will buy all that she needs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will delight to dress her to feed her well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for there are many channels into which my income must flow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i will not be a niggardly husband to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she will not have any of her own money to spend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to fling into the gutter if she chooses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a german wife does not ask for her own purse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time he turned on the power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as george and john pushed the little boat out from the dock it began to move but not before the canalman unbidden suddenly leaped on board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you for your very kind invitation he said as he seated himself on the cushions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we didnt ask you to come spoke up fred and we dont want your company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then if i go ashore i think there will be somebody going with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to find out who took that bond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont tell me where it is then i shall go to a constable or justice and get out a warrant for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have owned up that you had the bond on board your boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a stolen bond and i have been trying to run it down for some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i have found it or at least i have found the party that had it and you try to bluff me by saying that you wont tell me where it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can have my company for i shant leave you until i find out more about it or you can try to put me ashore and ill get help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as sure as youre sitting here ill swear out a warrant and have you arrested for stealing that bond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys were inexperienced and for a moment they stared blankly at one another startled more than they were willing to acknowledge by the bold threat of their unwelcome passenger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the man a moment later when no reply had been given to his questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing for us to do said grant in a low voice to fred is to keep right on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well take this man down to your grandfathers island and when we get there well tell him all about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell know best what to do and well wait for his advice before we do anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats all right soc said fred greatly relieved by the words of his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then turning to their passenger he said more boldly than before he had spoken i guess well take our chances and have you go with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well find out more about this later and give you a chance to tell your story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all the same to me said the man glibly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be glad to have the ride anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its been a long time since i have been on the st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apparently freds threat had produced slight effect upon the addition to their party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke as if he were in no fear for himself while his threat to swear out a warrant for the boys although it had startled them had not greatly alarmed any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile the black growler almost as if she was sharing in the excitement of the boys was speeding swiftly down the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the broad expanse of water when she left her dock at cape vincent soon was broken by the sight of many islands some of which were miles in extent while others were tiny little spots just lifted above the surface of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was some anxiety on the part of john that unfamiliar as they were with the channel they might strike some hidden rock but fred assured his friend that there was slight danger of that in the daytime as a careful watch was maintained and it was easy for them to follow the course of boats that were in advance of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said george suddenly pointing as he spoke to a yacht that was swiftly approaching from the canadian side of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she beat us down here by a good deal suggested george who was keenly observing the graceful and swift little motorboat that was steadily approaching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has been here a long time and theyre just out testing her on the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you going to try to race with her here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be time enough when we see what she can do in the real race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many races do they have down here in the summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one will be enough this summer im thinking laughed john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are we going to do with that man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he spoke john glanced again at the uninvited and unwelcome passenger who apparently was taking his ease on the cushions in the stern of the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to do nothing said fred quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i will leave him alone until we land at my grandfathers island and then i will tell him all about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired john glancing again at the man who apparently was unaware of the interest his presence on board the black growler had aroused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but supposing i dont want to go home she said supposingoh supposing i love you too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that case it would be even more imperative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true it is true dear nicolete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then aucassin she replied almost sternly in her great girlish love this is true alsoi love you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never loved shall never love any man but you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no more words spoken between us for a full hour that afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew deep down in my heart that it couldnt last yet how deny myself these roses while the opportunity of gathering them was mine!the more so as i believed it would do no harm to nicolete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at all events a day or two more or less of moonshine would make no matter either way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so all next day we walked hand in hand through paradise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has been said by them of old time and our fathers have told us that the kiss of first love the first kiss of the first woman we love is beyond all kisses sweet and true it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but true is it also that no less sweet is the first kiss of the last woman we love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> putting my faith in old saws as a young man will i had never dreamed to know again a bliss so divinely passionate and pure as came to me with every glance of nicoletes sweet eyes with every simple pressure of her hand and the joy that was mine when sometimes stopping on our way we would press together our lips ever so gravely and tenderly seems too holy even to speak of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the holy angels could not have loved nicolete with a purer love a love freer from taint of any earthly thought than i a man of thirty blase and fed from my youth upon the honeycomb of woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was curious that the first difficulty of our pilgrimage should befall us the very next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> coming towards nightfall to a small inn in a lonely unpopulated countryside we found that the only accommodation the inn afforded was one doublebedded room and there was no other inn for at least ten miles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i was more troubled than nicolete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when after interviewing the landlady i came and told her of the dilemma where she sat in the little parlour wearied out with the days walk she blushed it is true but seemed little put about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed she laughed and said it was rather fun like something out of sterne of such comfort is a literary reference in all seasons and circumstancesand then she added with a sweet look that sent the blood rioting about my heart it wont matter so much will it love now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there proved nothing for it but to accept the situation and we made the arrangement that nicolete was to slip off to bed first and then put out the light and go to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however when i followed her having sat up as long as the landladys patience would endure i found that though she had blown out the candle she had forgotten to put out the moon which shone as though it were st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stole in very shyly kept my eyes sternly from nicoletes white bed though as i couldnt shut my ears the sound of her breathing came to me with indescribable sweetness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after i had lain among the sheets some five or ten minutes i was suddenly im not asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now shut your eyes and go to sleepand fair dreams and sweet repose i replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wont you give me one little goodnight kiss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not a foot between our two beds so i bent over and took her soft white shoulders in my arms and kissed her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the heapedup sweetness of the whitest freshest flowers of the spring seemed in my embrace as i kissed her so soft so fragrant so pure and as the moonlight was the white fire in our blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> softly i released her stroked her brown hair and turned again to my pillow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the little voice was in the room maynt i hold your hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so our hands made a bridge across which our dreams might pass through the night and after a little while i knew that she slept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i lay thus holding her hand and listening to her quiet breathing i realised once more what my young alastor had meant by the purity of high passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt i tell you her name was helen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clarke groaned there could be no shadow of doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now dont you agree with me said villiers that in the story i have told you tonight and in the part this woman plays in it there are some very strange points <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes villiers clarke muttered it is a strange story indeed a strange story indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must give me time to think it over i may be able to help you or i may not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come and see me in the course of a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know austin said villiers as the two friends were pacing sedately along piccadilly one pleasant morning in may do you know i am convinced that what you told me about paul street and the herberts is a mere episode in an extraordinary history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may as well confess to you that when i asked you about herbert a few months ago i had just seen him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he begged of me in the street one night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was in the most pitiable plight but i recognized the man and i got him to tell me his history or at least the outline of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in brief it amounted to thishe had been ruined by his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not tell me he would only say that she had destroyed him body and soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for many a league they followed them over all the isles of the cyclades and away to the southwest across hellas till they came to the ionian sea and there they fell upon the echinades at the mouth of the achelous and those isles were called the whirlwind isles for many a hundred years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what became of zetes and calais i know not for the heroes never saw them again and some say that heracles met them and quarrelled with them and slew them with his arrows and some say that they fell down from weariness and the heat of the summer sun and that the sungod buried them among the cyclades in the pleasant isle of tenos and for many hundred years their grave was shown there and over it a pillar which turned to every wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but those dark storms and whirlwinds haunt the bosphorus until this day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the argonauts went eastward and out into the open sea which we now call the black sea but it was called the euxine then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no hellen had ever crossed it and all feared that dreadful sea and its rocks and shoals and fogs and bitter freezing storms and they told strange stories of it some false and some halftrue how it stretched northward to the ends of the earth and the sluggish putrid sea and the everlasting night and the regions of the dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the heroes trembled for all their courage as they came into that wild black sea and saw it stretching out before them without a shore as far as eye could see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and first orpheus spoke and warned them we shall come now to the wandering blue rocks my mother warned me of them and soon they saw the blue rocks shining like spires and castles of gray glass while an icecold wind blew from them and chilled all the heroes hearts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as they neared they could see them heaving as they rolled upon the long sea waves crashing and grinding together till the roar went up to heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sea sprang up in spouts between them and swept round them in white sheets of foam but their heads swung nodding high in air while the wind whistled shrill among the crags <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heroes hearts sank within them and they lay upon their oars in fear but orpheus called to tiphys the helmsman between them we must pass so look ahead for an opening and be brave for hera is with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tiphys the cunning helmsman stood silent clenching his teeth till he saw a heron come flying masthigh toward the rocks and hover awhile before them as if looking for a passage through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he cried hera has sent us a pilot let us follow the then the heron flapped to and fro a moment till he saw a hidden gap and into it he rushed like an arrow while the heroes watched what would befall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the blue rocks clashed together as the bird fled swiftly through but they struck but a feather from his tail and then rebounded apart at the shock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tiphys cheered the heroes and they shouted and the oars bent like withes beneath their strokes as they rushed between those toppling icecrags and the cold blue lips of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ere the rocks could meet again they had passed them and were safe out in the open sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after that they sailed on wearily along the asian coast by the black cape and thyneis where the hot stream of thymbris falls into the sea and sangarius whose waters float on the euxine till they came to wolf the river and to wolf the kindly king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there died two brave heroes idmon and tiphys the wise helmsman one died of an evil sickness and one a wild boar slew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the heroes heaped a mound above them and set upon it an oar on high and left them there to sleep together on the faroff lycian shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but idas killed the boar and avenged tiphys and ancaios took the rudder and was helmsman and steered them on toward the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they went on past sinope and many a mighty rivers mouth and past many a barbarous tribe and the cities of the amazons the warlike women of the east till all night they heard the clank of anvils and the roar of furnaceblasts and the forgefires shone like sparks through the darkness in the mountain glens aloft for they were come to the shores of the chalybes the smiths who never tire but serve ares the cruel wargod forging weapons day and night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at daydawn they looked eastward and midway between the sea and the sky they saw white snowpeaks hanging glittering sharp and bright above the clouds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they knew that they were come to caucasus at the end of all the earth caucasus the highest of all mountains the father of the rivers of the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his peak lies chained the titan while a vulture tears his heart and at his feet are piled dark forests round the magic colchian land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they rowed three days to the eastward while caucasus rose higher hour by hour till they saw the dark stream of phasis rushing headlong to the sea and shining above the treetops the golden roofs of king aietes the child of the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he left it where it was and it perished he might be charged with murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was at his wits endbut having got there he resolved on the simplest process namely to carry it to the station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no provision was made by the regulations of the force to protect a beat casually deserted even for a proper purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence while x was absent on his errand of mercy the valuable shop of messrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trinkett and blouse ecclesiastical tailors was broken into and several stoles chasubles altarcloths and other decorative tapestries were appropriated to profane uses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the station the baby was disposed of according to rule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> due entry was first made in the nightbook by the superintendent of all the particulars of his discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some cold milk was then procured and poured down the childs throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwards wrapped in a constables cape he was placed in a cell where when the door was locked he could not disturb the guardians of the peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same night in the next cell an innocent gentleman seized with an apoplexy in the street but entered in the chargesheet as drunk and incapable died like a dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room was quieter now for edward had got the dragon down and was boring holes in him with a purring sound harold was ascending the steps of the athenaeum with a jaunty airsuggestive rather of the junior carlton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> outside the tall elmtops were hardly to be seen through the feathery storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the skys afalling quoted charlotte softly i must go and tell the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the quotation suggested a fairy story and i offered to read to her reaching out for the book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the wee folk were under a cloud sceptical hints had embittered the chalice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i was fain to fetch arthursecond favourite with charlotte for his dames riding errant and an easy first with us boys for his spearsplintering crash of tourney and hurtle against hopeless odds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here again however i proved unfortunatewhat illluck made the book open at the sorrowful history of balin and balan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he vanished anon i read and so he heard an horne blow as it had been the death of a beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that blast said balin is blowen for me for i am the prize and yet am i not dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charlotte began to cry she knew the rest too well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sucking his thumb a thing which members of the reform are seldom seen to do and he stared wide eyed at his tear stained sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edward put off his histrionics and rushed up to her as the consolera new part for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was when she was somewhere over in that beastly abroadhe had once spent a black month of misery at dinanand there was a fellow there who had got two storks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the other stork was quite sorry and moped and went on and got very miserable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they looked about and found a duck and introduced it to the stork <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the duck was a drake but the stork didnt mind and they loved each other and were as jolly as could be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by another duck came alonga real sheduck this timeand when the drake saw her he fell in love and left the stork and went and proposed to the duck for she was very beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the poor stork who was left he said nothing at all to anybody but just pined and pined and pined away till one morning he was found quite dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was edwards idea of a jolly story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down again went the corners of poor charlottes mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really edwards stupid inability to see the real point in anything was too annoying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> years before it being necessary to prepare his youthful mind for a domestic event that might lead to awkward questionings at a time when there was little leisure to invent appropriate answers it was delicately inquired of him whether he would like to have a little brother or perhaps a little sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he considered the matter carefully in all its bearings and finally declared for a newfoundland pup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any boy more gleg at the uptak would have met his parents halfway and eased their burden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was the matter had to be approached all over again from a fresh standpoint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now while charlotte turned away sniffingly with a hiccough that told of an overwrought soul edward unconscious like sir isaacs diamond of the mischief he had done wheeled round on harold with a shout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want a live dragon he announced youve got to be my dragon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can i be a dragon and belong to all the clubs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but wouldnt you like to be a nice scaly dragon all green said edward trying persuasion with a curly tail and red eyes and breathing real smoke and fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harold wavered an instant pallmall was still strong in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next he was grovelling on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no saurian ever swung a tail so scaly and so curly as his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with horrific pants he emitted smokiest smoke and fiercest fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a voyage to laputa balnibarbi luggnagg glubbdubdrib and japan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the author sets out on his third voyage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is i had not been at home above ten days when captain william robinson a cornish man commander of the hopewell a stout ship of three hundred tons came to my house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had formerly been surgeon of another ship where he was master and a fourth part owner in a voyage to the levant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had always treated me more like a brother than an inferior officer and hearing of my arrival made me a visit as i apprehended only out of friendship for nothing passed more than what is usual after long absences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but repeating his visits often expressing his joy to find i me in good health asking whether i were now settled for life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adding that he intended a voyage to the east indies in two months at last he plainly invited me though with some apologies to be surgeon of the ship that i should have another surgeon under me beside our two mates that my salary should be double to the usual pay and that having experienced my knowledge in seaaffairs to be at least equal to his he would enter into any engagement to follow my advice as much as if i had shared in the command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said so many other obliging things and i knew him to be so honest a man that i could not reject this proposal the thirst i had of seeing the world notwithstanding my past misfortunes continuing as violent as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only difficulty that remained was to persuade my wife whose consent however i at last obtained by the prospect of advantage she proposed to her children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we set out the th day of august and arrived at fort st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george the th of april we staid there three weeks to refresh our crew many of whom were sick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from thence we went to tonquin where the captain resolved to continue some time because many of the goods he intended to buy were not ready nor could he expect to be dispatched in several months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore in hopes to defray some of the charges he must be at he bought a sloop loaded it with several sorts of goods wherewith the tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands and putting fourteen men on board whereof three were of the country he appointed me master of the sloop and gave me power to traffic while he transacted his affairs at tonquin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had not sailed above three days when a great storm arising we were driven five days to the northnortheast and then to the east after which we had fair weather but still with a pretty strong gale from the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates who soon overtook us for my sloop was so deep laden that she sailed very slow neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were boarded about the same time by both the pirates who entered furiously at the head of their men but finding us all prostrate upon our faces for so i gave order they pinioned us with strong ropes and setting guard upon us went to search the sloop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i observed among them a dutchman who seemed to be of some authority though he was not commander of either ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew us by our countenances to be englishmen and jabbering to us in his own language swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spoken dutch tolerably well i told him who we were and begged him in consideration of our being christians and protestants of neighbouring countries in strict alliance that he would move the captains to take some pity on us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this inflamed his rage he repeated his threatenings and turning to his companions spoke with great vehemence in the japanese language as i suppose often using the word christianos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a japanese captain who spoke a little dutch but very imperfectly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came up to me and after several questions which i answered in great humility he said we should not die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made the captain a very low bow and then turning to the dutchman said i was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen than in a brother for that malicious reprobate having often endeavoured in vain to persuade both the captains that i might be thrown into the sea which they would not yield to after the promise made me that i should not die however prevailed so far as to have a punishment inflicted on me worse in all human appearance than death itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my men were sent by an equal division into both the pirate ships and my sloop new manned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to myself it was determined that i should be set adrift in a small canoe with paddles and a sail and four days provisions which last the japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores and would permit no man to search me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got down into the canoe while the dutchman standing upon the deck loaded me with all the curses and injurious terms his language could afford <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about an hour before we saw the pirates i had taken an observation and found we were in the latitude of n <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and longitude of when i was at some distance from the pirates i discovered by my pocketglass several islands to the southeast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i set up my sail the wind being fair with a design to reach the nearest of those islands which i made a shift to do in about three hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all rocky however i got many birds eggs and striking fire i kindled some heath and dry seaweed by which i roasted my eggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ate no other supper being resolved to spare my provisions as much as i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i passed the night under the shelter of a rock strewing some heath under me and slept pretty well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day i sailed to another island and thence to a third and fourth sometimes using my sail and sometimes my paddles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not to trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses let it suffice that on the fifth day i arrived at the last island in my sight which lay southsoutheast to the former <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this island was at a greater distance than i expected and i did not reach it in less than five hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i encompassed it almost round before i could find a convenient place to land in which was a small creek about three times the wideness of my canoe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found the island to be all rocky only a little intermingled with tufts of grass and sweetsmelling herbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself i secured the remainder in a cave whereof there were great numbers i gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks and got a quantity of dry seaweed and parched grass which i designed to kindle the next day and roast my eggs as well as i could for i had about me my flint steel match and burningglass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lay all night in the cave where i had lodged my provisions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my bed was the same dry grass and seaweed which i intended for fuel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i slept very little for the disquiets of my mind prevailed over my weariness and kept me awake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i considered how impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place and how miserable my end must be yet found myself so listless and desponding that i had not the heart to rise and before i could get spirits enough to creep out of my cave the day was far advanced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walked awhile among the rocks the sky was perfectly clear and the sun so hot that i was forced to turn my face from it when all on a sudden it became obscure as i thought in a manner very different from what happens by the interposition of a cloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned back and perceived a vast opaque body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island it seemed to be about two miles high and hid the sun six or seven minutes but i did not observe the air to be much colder or the sky more darkened than if i had stood under the shade of a mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it approached nearer over the place where i was it appeared to be a firm substance the bottom flat smooth and shining very bright from the reflection of the sea below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me at less than an english mile distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took out my pocket perspective and could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of it which appeared to be sloping but what those people where doing i was not able to distinguish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy and i was ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might some way or other help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition i was in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment to behold an island in the air inhabited by men who were able as it should seem to raise or sink or put it into progressive motion as they pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise upon this phenomenon i rather chose to observe what course the island would take because it seemed for awhile to stand still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet soon after it advanced nearer and i could see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries and stairs at certain intervals to descend from one to the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the lowest gallery i beheld some people fishing with long angling rods and others looking on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i waved my cap for my hat was long since worn out and my handkerchief toward the island and upon its nearer approach i called and shouted with the utmost strength of my voice and then looking circumspectly i beheld a crowd gather to that side which was most in my view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found by their pointing towards me and to each other that they plainly discovered me although they made no return to my shouting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i could see four or five men running in great haste up the stairs to the top of the island who then disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i happened rightly to conjecture that these were sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> waving her hand to indicate the little stone plain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the mountains and rivers and forestsall the people in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be impossible rima consider how large it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come let us go togetherwe two and grandfatherand see all the world all the mountains and forests and know all the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do not know what you are saying rima <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might as well say come let us go to the sun and find out everything in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is you who do not know what you are saying she retorted with brightening eyes which for a moment glanced full into mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have no wings like birds to fly to the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> am i not able to walk on the earth and run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you imagine that all the earth is like this little portion you see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are great rivers which you cannot cross by swimming mountains you cannot climb forests you cannot penetratedark and inhabited by dangerous beasts and so vast that all this space your eyes look on is a mere speck of earth in comparison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried with a strangely brightening look and then half turning from me she added with sudden petulance yet only a minute ago you knew nothing of the worldbecause it is so large <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is anything to be gained by speaking to one who says such contrary things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i explained that i had not contradicted myself that she had not rightly interpreted my words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew i said something about the principal features of the different countries of the world as for instance the largest mountain ranges and rivers and the cities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also something but very little about the tribes of savage men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she heard me with impatience which made me speak rapidly in very general terms and to simplify the matter i made the world stand for the continent we were in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed idle to go beyond that and her eagerness would not have allowed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me all you know she said the moment i ceased speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the villages the tribes the people everywhere tell me for i must know it all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that country i said waving my hands from east to west is guayana and so large is it that you could go in this direction or in this travelling for months without seeing the end of guayana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still it would be guayana rivers rivers rivers with forests between and other forests and rivers beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and savage people nations and tribesguahibo aguaricoto ayano maco piaroa quiriquiripo tuparitoshall i name a hundred more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be useless rima they are all savages and live widely scattered in the forests hunting with bow and arrow and the zabatana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do i not know all this is guayana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes there northwards it ends at the orinoco a mighty river coming from mighty mountains compared with which ytaioa is like a stone on the around on which we have sat down to rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must know that guayana is only a portion a half of our country venezuela <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look i continued putting my hand round my shoulder to touch the middle of my back there is a groove running down my spine dividing my body into equal parts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus does the great orinoco divide venezuela and on one side of it is all guayana and on the other side the countries or provinces of cumana maturm barcelona bolivar guarico apure and many others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then gave a rapid description of the northern half of the country with its vast llanos covered with herds in one part its plantations of coffee rice and sugarcane in another and its chief towns last of all caracas the gay and opulent little paris in america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this seemed to weary her but the moment i ceased speaking and before i could well moisten my dry lips she demanded to know what came after caracasafter all venezuela <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are no people therein the water only fishes she remarked then suddenly continued why are you silentis venezuela then all the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the task i had set myself to perform seemed only at its commencement yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thinking how to proceed with it my eyes roved over the level area we were standing on and it struck me that this little irregular plain broad at one end and almost pointed at the other roughly resembled the south american continent in its form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look rima i began here we are on this small pebbleytaioa and this line round it shuts us inwe cannot see beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now let us imagine that we can see beyondthat we can see the whole flat mountaintop and that you know is the whole world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now listen while i tell you of all the countries and principal mountains and rivers and cities of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plan i had now fixed on involved a great deal of walking about and some hard work in moving and setting up stones and tracing boundary and other lines but it gave me pleasure for rima was close by all the time following me from place to place listening to all i said in silence but with keen interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the broad end of the level summit i marked out venezuela showing by means of a long line how the orinoco divided it and also marking several of the greater streams flowing into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i also marked the sites of caracas and other large towns with stones and rejoiced that we are not like the europeans great citybuilders for the stones proved heavy to lift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then followed colombia and ecuador on the west and successively bolivia peru chile ending at last in the south with patagonia a cold arid land bleak and desolate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i marked the littoral cities as we progressed on that side where earth ends and the pacific ocean begins and infinitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then in a sudden burst of inspiration i described the cordilleras to herthat worldlong stupendous chain its sea of titicaca and wintry desolate paramo where lie the ruins of tiahuanaco older than thebes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mentioned its principal citiesthose small inflamed or festering pimples that attract much attention from appearing on such a body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quito callednot in irony but by its own peoplethe splendid and the magnificent so high above the earth as to appear but a little way removed from heavende quito al cielo as the saying is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of its sublime history its kings and conquerors haymar capac the mighty and huascar and atahualpa the unhappy not one word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many wordshow inadequate!of the summits white with everlasting snows above itabove this navel of the world above the earth the ocean the darkening tempest the condors flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flamebreathing cotopaxi whose wrathful mutterings are audible two hundred leagues away and chimborazo antisana sarata illimani aconcaguanames of mountains that affect us like the names of gods implacable pachacamac and viracocha whose everlasting granite thrones they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the last i showed her cuzco the city of the sun and the highest dwellingplace of men on earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was carried away by so sublime a theme and remembering that i had no critical hearer i gave free reins to fancy forgetting for the moment that some undiscovered thought or feeling had prompted her questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and while i spoke of the mountains she hung on my words following me closely in my walk her countenance brilliant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there yet remained to be described all that unimaginable space east of the andes the riverswhat rivers!the green plains that are like the seathe illimitable waste of water where there is no landand the forest region <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very thought of the amazonian forest made my spirit droop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could have snatched her up and placed her on the dome of chimborazo she would have looked on an area of ten thousand square miles of earth so vast is the horizon at that elevation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and possibly her imagination would have been able to clothe it all with an unbroken forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet how small a portion this would be of the stupendous wholeof a forest region equal in extent to the whole of europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all loveliness all grace all majesty are there but we cannot see cannot conceivecome away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through this we passed into an enclosure beneath the seats where we found a number of other prisoners herded together under guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of them were in irons but for the most part they seemed sufficiently awed by the presence of their guards to preclude any possibility of attempted escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the trip from shador i had had no opportunity to talk with my fellowprisoner but now that we were safely within the barred paddock our guards abated their watchfulness with the result that i found myself able to approach the red martian youth for whom i felt such a strange attraction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are we to fight for the edification of the first born or is it something worse than that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a part of the monthly rites of issus he replied in which black men wash the sins from their souls in the blood of men from the outer world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if perchance the black is killed it is evidence of his disloyalty to issus the unpardonable sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he lives through the contest he is held acquitted of the charge that forced the sentence of the rites as it is called upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a number of us may be pitted together against an equal number or twice the number of blacks or singly we may be sent forth to face wild beasts or some famous black warrior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if we are victorious i asked what thenfreedom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none who enters the domains of the first born ever leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we prove able fighters we are permitted to fight often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we are not mighty fighters he shrugged his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sooner or later we die in the arena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some hundred black devils have i accounted for during nearly a year of the rites of issus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother would be very proud could she only know how well i have maintained the traditions of my fathers prowess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father must have been a mighty warrior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have known most of the warriors of barsoom in my time doubtless i knew him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the slaughter with you and roughly we were hustled to the steep incline that led to the chambers far below which let out upon the arena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the amphitheatre like all i had ever seen upon barsoom was built in a large excavation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the highest seats which formed the low wall surrounding the pit were above the level of the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the arena itself was far below the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just beneath the lowest tier of seats was a series of barred cages on a level with the surface of the arena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but unfortunately my youthful friend was not of those who occupied a cage with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> directly opposite my cage was the throne of issus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the horrid creature squatted surrounded by a hundred slave maidens sparkling in jewelled trappings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brilliant cloths of many hues and strange patterns formed the soft cushion covering of the dais upon which they reclined about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on four sides of the throne and several feet below it stood three solid ranks of heavily armed soldiery elbow to elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in front of these were the high dignitaries of this mock heavengleaming blacks bedecked with precious stones upon their foreheads the insignia of their rank set in circles of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on both sides of the throne stretched a solid mass of humanity from top to bottom of the amphitheatre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were as many women as men and each was clothed in the wondrously wrought harness of his station and his house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with each black was from one to three slaves drawn from the domains of the therns and from the outer world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no peasantry among the first born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the lowest soldier is a god and has his slaves to wait upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men fightthat is a sacred privilege and duty to fight and die for issus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slaves wash them slaves dress them slaves feed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some even who have slaves that talk for them and i saw one who sat during the rites with closed eyes while a slave narrated to her the events that were transpiring within the arena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first event of the day was the tribute to issus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it marked the end of those poor unfortunates who had looked upon the divine glory of the goddess a full year before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were ten of themsplendid beauties from the proud courts of mighty jeddaks and from the temples of the holy therns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a year they had served in the retinue of issus today they were to pay the price of this divine preferment with their lives tomorrow they would grace the tables of the court functionaries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a huge black entered the arena with the young women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carefully he inspected them felt of their limbs and poked them in the ribs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently he selected one of their number whom he led before the throne of issus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he addressed some words to the goddess which i could not hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the black raised his hands above his head in token of salute grasped the girl by the wrist and dragged her from the arena through a small doorway below the throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> issus will dine well tonight said a prisoner beside me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was her dinner that old thabis is taking to the kitchens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didst not note how carefully he selected the plumpest and tenderest of the lot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i growled out my curses on the monster sitting opposite us on the gorgeous throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fume not admonished my companion you will see far worse than that if you live even a month among the first born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned again in time to see the gate of a nearby cage thrown open and three monstrous white apes spring into the arena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls shrank in a frightened group in the centre of the enclosure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one was on her knees with imploring hands outstretched toward issus but the hideous deity only leaned further forward in keener anticipation of the entertainment to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length the apes spied the huddled knot of terrorstricken maidens and with demoniacal shrieks of bestial frenzy charged upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wave of mad fury surged over me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cruel cowardliness of the powerdrunk creature whose malignant mind conceived such frightful forms of torture stirred to their uttermost depths my resentment and my manhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bloodred haze that presaged death to my foes swam before my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the guard lolled before the unbarred gate of the cage which confined me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what need of bars indeed to keep those poor victims from rushing into the arena which the edict of the gods had appointed as their death place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a single blow sent the black unconscious to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snatching up his longsword i sprang into the arena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the apes were almost upon the maidens but a couple of mighty bounds were all my earthly muscles required to carry me to the centre of the sandstrewn floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an instant silence reigned in the great amphitheatre then a wild shout arose from the cages of the doomed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my longsword circled whirring through the air and a great ape sprawled headless at the feet of the fainting girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other apes turned now upon me and as i stood facing them a sullen roar from the audience answered the wild cheers from the cages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the tail of my eye i saw a score of guards rushing across the glistening sand toward me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a figure broke from one of the cages behind them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the youth whose personality so fascinated me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused a moment before the cages with upraised sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us make our deaths worth while and at the back of this unknown warrior turn this days tribute to issus into an orgy of revenge that will echo through the ages and cause black skins to blanch at each repetition of the rites of issus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the racks without your cages are filled with blades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without waiting to note the outcome of his plea he turned and bounded toward me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from every cage that harboured red men a thunderous shout went up in answer to his exhortation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody had been putting a powder in the flames for suddenly the place became very quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fiddles still sounded but far away like an echo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lights went down all but a circle on the stage and into that circle stepped my enemy of the skin cap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard a whisper behind me and the words were those which kuprasso had used the day before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these bedlamites were called the companions of the rosy hours and kuprasso had promised great dancing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hoped to goodness they would not see us for they had fairly given me the horrors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter felt the same and we both made ourselves very small in that dark corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the newcomers had no eyes for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a twinkling the pavilion changed from a common saloon which might have been in chicago or paris to a place of mystery yes and of beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it became the gardenhouse of suliman the red whoever that sportsman may have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sandy had said that the ends of the earth converged there and he had been right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lost all consciousness of my neighbours stout german frockcoated turk frowsy jewess and saw only strange figures leaping in a circle of light figures that came out of the deepest darkness to make a big magic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the leader flung some stuff into the brazier and a great fan of blue light flared up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was weaving circles and he was singing something shrill and high whilst his companions made a chorus with their deep monotone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell you what the dance was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had seen the russian ballet just before the war and one of the men in it reminded me of this man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the dancing was the least part of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was neither sound nor movement nor scent that wrought the spell but something far more potent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant i found myself reft away from the present with its dull dangers and looking at a world all young and fresh and beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a window i was looking from and i was gazing at the finest landscape on earth lit by the pure clean light of morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to be part of the veld but like no veld i had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was wider and wilder and more gracious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed i was looking at my first youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was feeling the kind of immortal light heartedness which only a boy knows in the dawning of his days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no longer any fear of these magicmakers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were kindly wizards who had brought me into fairyland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then slowly from the silence there distilled drops of music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came like water falling a long way into a cup each the essential quality of pure sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we with our elaborate harmonies have forgotten the charm of single notes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the african natives know it and i remember a learned man once telling me that the greeks had the same art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those silver bells broke out of infinite space so exquisite and perfect that no mortal words could have been fitted to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the music i expect that the morning stars made when they sang together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the glow passed from blue to purple and then to an angry red <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bit by bit the notes spun together till they had made a harmony a fierce restless harmony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i was conscious again of the skinclad dancers beckoning out of their circle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no mistake about the meaning now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the daintiness and youth had fled and passion was beating the air terrible savage passion which belonged neither to day nor night life nor death but to the halfworld between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suddenly felt the dancers as monstrous inhuman devilish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thick scents that floated from the brazier seemed to have a tang of newshed blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cries broke from the hearers cries of anger and lust and terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard a woman sob and peter who is as tough as any mortal took tight hold of my arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i now realized that these companions of the rosy hours were the only thing in the world to fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rasta and stumm seemed feeble simpletons by contrast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the window i had been looking out of was changed to a prison wall i could see the mortar between the massive blocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a second these devils would be smelling out their enemies like some foul witchdoctors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt the burning eyes of their leader looking for me in the gloom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter was praying audibly beside me and i could have choked him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his infernal chatter would reveal us for it seemed to me that there was no one in the place except us and the magicworkers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door was flung open and a great gust of icy wind swirled through the hall driving clouds of ashes from the braziers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard loud voices without and a hubbub began inside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment it was quite dark and then someone lit one of the flare lamps by the stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it revealed nothing but the common squalor of a low saloon white faces sleepy eyes and frowsy heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the droppiece was there in all its tawdriness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the companions of the rosy hours had gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the door stood men in uniform i heard a german a long way off murmur envers bodyguards and i heard him distinctly for though i could not see clearly my hearing was desperately acute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is often the way when you suddenly come out of a swoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turk and german tumbled over each other while kuprasso wailed and wept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one seemed to stop them and then i saw the reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the authorities had tracked us down and it was all up with peter and me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sudden revulsion leaves a man with a low vitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were done and there was an end of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was kismet the act of god and there was nothing for it but to submit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hadnt a flicker of a thought of escape or resistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man who seemed to be a sergeant pointed to us and said something to kuprasso who nodded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got heavily to our feet and stumbled towards them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with one on each side of us we crossed the yard walked through the dark passage and the empty shop and out into the snowy street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a closed carriage waiting which they motioned us to get into <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both of us sat still like truant schoolboys with our hands on our knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know where i was going and i didnt care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we seemed to be rumbling up the hill and then i caught the glare of lighted streets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the end of it peter i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ja cornelis he replied and that was all our talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by hours later it seemed we stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> someone opened the door and we got out to find ourselves in a courtyard with a huge dark building around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prison i guessed and i wondered if they would give us blankets for it was perishing cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we entered a door and found ourselves in a big stone hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite warm which made me more hopeful about our cells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man in some kind of uniform pointed to the staircase up which we plodded wearily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mind was too blank to take clear impressions or in any way to forecast the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another warder met us and took us down a passage till we halted at a door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood aside and motioned us to enter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guessed that this was the governors room and we should be put through our first examination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my head was too stupid to think and i made up my mind to keep perfectly mum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no kind of story but i resolved not to give anything away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i turned the handle i wondered idly what kind of sallow turk or bulgingnecked german we should find inside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a pleasant room with a polished wood floor and a big fire burning on the hearth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside the fire a man lay on a couch with a little table drawn up beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on that table was a small glass of milk and a number of patience cards spread in rows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stared blankly at the spectacle till i saw a second figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the man in the skincap the leader of the dancing maniacs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both peter and i backed sharply at the sight and then stood stock still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the dancer crossed the room in two strides and gripped both of my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter twelve a spasm of incredulity a vast relief and that sharp joy which comes of reaction chased each other across my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had come suddenly out of very black waters into an unbelievable calm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dropped into the nearest chair and tried to grapple with something far beyond words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sandy i said as soon as i got my breath youre an incarnate it was the only way dick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i hadnt come mewing like a tomcat at your heels yesterday rasta would have had you long before you got to your hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you two have given me a pretty anxious time and it took some doing to get you safe here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cried incredulously for my wits were still wool you may call it my humble home it was blenkirons sleek voice that spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve been preparing for you major but it was i introduced peter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr pienaar said blenkiron pleased to meet you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the while he stood there quietly beside evadna his attitude almost that of boredom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think since you have been properly notified to leave said baumberger with the indefinable air of a lawyer who gathers up his papers relating to one case thrusts them into his pocket and turns his attention to the needs of his next client well just have it out with these other fellows though i look upon stanley he added half humorously as a test case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> better say hes a tough case blurted wally and turned on his heel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the devil are they standing around on one foot for making medicine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he demanded angrily of good indian who unceremoniously left evadna and came up with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id run him off the ranch first and do my talking about it afterward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that hunk uh pork is kicking up a lot uh dust but he aint getting anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good indian thrust both hands deep into his trousers pockets and stared at the ground before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how it hits you grantbut theres something fishy about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good indian took one long step over the ditch and went on steadily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wally coming again alongside turned his head and regarded him attentively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> injuns on top he diagnosed sententiously after a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looks like hes putting on a good thick layer uh warpaint too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might hand me the brush when youre through he hinted grimly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might like to get out after some scalps myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good indian asked inattentively and went on without waiting for any reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they left the garden and went down the road to the stable wally passively following grants lead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> someone came hurrying after them and they turned to see jack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others had evidently stayed to hear the legal harangue to a close <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say stanley says theres four beside the fellows we saw jack announced rather breathlessly for he had been running through the loose heavy soil of the garden to overtake them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyve located twenty acres apiece he saysstaked em out in the night and stuck up their noticesand everyones going to stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre all going to put in grizzlies and mine the whole thing he told dad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he just the same as accused dad right out of covering up valuable mineral land on purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he says the laws all on their side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaned hard against the stable and drew his fingers across his forehead white as a girls when he pushed back his hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baumberger he said cheerlessly was still talking injunction when i left but he flung out his hand contemptuously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish dad wasnt so began wally moodily and let it go at that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good indian threw up his head with that peculiar tightening of lips which meant much in the way of emotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell listen to baumberger and hell lose the ranch listening he stated distinctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if theres anything to do weve got to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can run em offmaybe suggested jack his fighting instincts steadied by the vivid memory of four rifles held by four men who looked thoroughly capable of using them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this isnt a case of applestealing good indian quelled sharply and got his rope from his saddle with the manner of a man who has definitely made up his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good indian started for the little pasture where keno was feeding and switching methodically at the flies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you fellows can do more by doing nothing today than if you killed off the whole bunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came back in a few minutes with his horse and found the two still moodily discussing the thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he glanced at them casually and went about the business of saddling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked wally abruptly when grant was looping up the end of his latigo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just scouting around a little was the unsatisfactory reply he got and he scowled as good indian rode away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good indian spoke briefly with the goodlooking young squaw who had a shy glance for him when he came up afterward he took hold of his hat by the brim and ducked through the low opening of a wikiup which she smilingly pointed out to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked when his unaccustomed eyes discerned the old fellow lying back against the farther wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having his injury thus brought afresh to his notice peppajee reached down with his hands and moved the foot carefully to a new position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last night good indian began without that ceremony of long waiting which is a part of indian etiquette much men come to hart ranch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held up his two outspread hands with the thumbs tucked inside his palms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come in dark no seeum till sun come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one man put sticks in ground say that part belong him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flung up his hands lowered them and immediately raised them again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say that ranch have much gold stake placer claims <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baumbergerhe saw peppajees eyelids draw togethertell men to go away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you sabe ask great father to tell those men they go away no wash gold on ranch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no hurrying the speech of an indian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peppajee smoked stolidly his eyes half closed and blinking sleepily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the veneer of white mens ways dropped from him when he entered his own wikiup and he would not speak quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked as one who holds his judgment in abeyance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i let those men come while i think ofa girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good indian was too proud to parry too bitter with himself to deny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not said the thing before even to himself but it was in his heart to hate his love because it had cost this catastrophe to his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after a time he spoke more sympathetically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this day yo no thinkum squaw all time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mebbyso yo thinkum fight no sabe how yo fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would seem that peppajee understood even though his speech was halting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that moment much of the unfounded prejudice which had been for a few days set aside because of bigger things died within him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had disliked peppajee as a pompous egotist among his kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his latent antagonism against all indians because they were unwelcomely his blood relatives had crystallized here and there against certain individuals of the tribe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his youthful arrogance he had not troubled to see the real man of mettle under that dingy green blanket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he looked at peppajee with a startled sense that he had never known him at all and that peppajee was not only a grimy indianhe was also a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> them mens come baumberga tellum come all time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i come here said good indian i think you mebbyso hear talk you tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my heart heap sad i let this trouble come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mebbyso make my friends laugh be heap glad those men no stealum ranch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you hear talk mebbyso you tell me now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peppajee smoked imperturbably what time his dignity demanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss marwood says it is wrong to hate anyone but i dont care i hate cyrus brisk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cyrus brisk would be an awful name giggled felicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie brisk says cyrus is ruining all the trees on his fathers place cutting your name on them said sara ray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his father told him he would whip him if he didnt stop but cyrus keeps right on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie says he cut yours and his together on the birch tree in front of the parlour window and a row of hearts around them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just where every visitor can see them i suppose lamented cecily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what i mind most of all is he sits and looks at me in school with such melancholy reproachful eyes when he ought to be working sums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont look at him but i feel him staring at me and it makes me so nervous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say his mother was out of her mind at one time said felicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think felicity was quite well pleased that cyrus should have passed over her rosered prettiness to set his affections on that demure elf of a cecily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not want the allegiance of cyrus in the least but it was something of a slight that he had not wanted her to want it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he sends me pieces of poetry he cuts out of the papers cecily went on with lots of the lines marked with a lead pencil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will not relent to me then must i learn to know darkness alone till life be flown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herei have the piece in my sewingbagill read it all to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those three graceless girls read the sentimental rhyme and giggled over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after all though cecily never relented towards him he did not condemn himself to darkness alone till life was flown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite early in life he wedded a stout rosy buxom lass the very antithesis of his first love he prospered in his undertakings raised a large and respectable family and was eventually appointed a justice of the peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> june was crowded full of interest that year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we gathered in with its sheaf of fragrant days the choicest harvest of childhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cecily declared she hated to go to sleep for fear she might miss something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were so many dear delights along the golden road to give us pleasurethe earth dappled with new blossom the dance of shadows in the fields the rustling rainwet ways of the woods the faint fragrance in meadow lanes liltings of birds and croon of bees in the old orchard windy pipings on the hills sunset behind the pines limpid dews filling primrose cups crescent moons through darklings boughs soft nights alight with blinking stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we enjoyed all these boons unthinkingly and lightheartedly as children do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besides these there was the absorbing little drama of human life which was being enacted all around us and in which each of us played a satisfying partthe gay preparations for aunt olivias midjune wedding the excitement of practising for the concert with which our schoolteacher mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perkins had elected to close the school year and cecilys troubles with cyrus brisk which furnished unholy mirth for the rest of us though cecily could not see the funny side of it at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matters went from bad to worse in the case of the irrepressible cyrus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he continued to shower cecily with notes the spelling of which showed no improvement he worried the life out of her by constantly threatening to fight willy fraseralthough as felicity sarcastically pointed out he never did it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im always afraid he will said cecily and it would be such a disgrace to have two boys fighting over me in school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have encouraged cyrus a little in the beginning or hed never have been so persevering said felicity unjustly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know very well felicity king that i hated cyrus brisk ever since the very first time i saw his big fat red face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felicity is just jealous because cyrus didnt take a notion to her instead of you sis said dan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i did you wouldnt understand me sweet little sister rejoined aggravating dan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally cyrus crowned his iniquities by stealing the denied lock of cecilys hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one sunny afternoon in school cecily and kitty marr asked and received permission to sit out on the side bench before the open window where the cool breeze swept in from the green fields beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to sit on this bench was always considered a treat and was only allowed as a reward of merit but cecily and kitty had another reason for wishing to sit there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kitty had read in a magazine that sunbaths were good for the hair so both she and cecily tossed their long braids over the windowsill and let them hang there in the broiling sunshine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and while cecily sat thus diligently working a fraction sum on her slate that base cyrus asked permission to go out having previously borrowed a pair of scissors from one of the big girls who did fancy work at the noon recess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> outside cyrus sneaked up close to the window and cut off a piece of cecilys hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this rape of the lock did not produce quite such terrible consequences as the more famous one in popes poem but cecilys soul was no less agitated than belindas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried all the way home from school about it and only checked her tears when dan declared hed fight cyrus and make him give it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont have you fighting on my account for anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besides hed likely lick youhes so big and rough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the folks at home might find out all about it and uncle roger would never give me any peace and mother would be cross for shed never believe it wasnt my fault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wouldnt be so bad if hed only taken a little but he cut a great big chunk right off the end of one of the braids <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill have to cut the other to make them fairand theyll look so awful stubby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but cyrus acquirement of the chunk of hair was his last triumph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his downfall was near and although it involved cecily in a most humiliating experience over which she cried half the following night in the end she confessed it was worth undergoing just to get rid of cyrus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no communication of any sort was permitted between his pupils during school hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyone caught violating this rule was promptly punished by the infliction of one of the weird penances for which mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perkins was famous and which were generally far worse than ordinary whipping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day in school cyrus sent a letter across to cecily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> usually he left his effusions in her desk or between the leaves of her books but this time it was passed over to her under cover of the desk through the hands of two or three scholars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as em frewen held it over the aisle mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perkins wheeled around from his station before the blackboard and caught her in the act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took it held it up and scrutinized the address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> em said quite shamelessly that she didnt knowit had just been passed over from the next row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i suppose you have no idea where it came from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may take your seat emmeline and you will remain at the foot of your spelling class for a week as punishment for passing the note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indignant em sat down and poor innocent cecily was haled forth to public ignominy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cecily said her tormentor do you know who wrote this letter to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill touch nothin thatll break the heart of any woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever since the eventful morning when carl had neglected the big gray for a stolen hour with jennie cully had busied himself in devising ways of making the swedes life miserable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a boys keen insight he had discovered enough to convince him that carl was dead mashed on jennie as he put it but whether for keeps or not he had not yet determined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had already enriched his songs with certain tender allusions to their present frame of mind and their future state of happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where was moses when the light went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and little annie rooney had undergone so subtle a change when sung at the top of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> james finnegans voice that while the original warp and woof of those very popular melodies were entirely unrecognizable to any but the persons interested to them they were as gall and wormwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was cullys invariable way of expressing his opinions on current affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would sit on the frontboard of his cartthe big gray stumbling over the stones as he walked the reins lying looseand fill the air with details of events passing in the village with all the gusto of a variety actor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the impending strike at the brewery had been made the basis of a paraphrase of johnnie get your gun and even mcgaws red head had come in for its share of abuse to the air of fire boys fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so for a time this new development of tenderness on the part of carl for jennie served to ring the changes on moses and annie rooney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carls budding hopes had been slightly nipped by the cold look in toms eye when she asked him if it took an hour to give jennie a tattered apron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with some disappointment he noticed that except at rare intervals and only when tom was at home he was no longer invited to the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had always been a timid shrinking fellow where a woman was concerned having followed the sea and lived among men since he was sixteen years old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during these earlier years he had made two voyages in the pacific and another to the whalingground in the arctic seas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this last voyage in a gale of wind he had saved all the lives aboard a brig the crew helpless from scurvy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the lifeboat reached the lee of her stern carl at the risk of his life climbed aboard caught a line and lowered the men one by one into the rescuing yawl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could with perfect equanimity have faced another storm and rescued a second crew any hour of the day or night but he could not face a womans displeasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover what tom wanted done was law to carl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had taken him out of the streets and given him a home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would serve her in whatever way she wished as long as he lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on rainy days or when work was dull in the winter months the old man would often come into carls little chamber next the harnessroom in the stable and sit on his bed by the hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and carl would tell him about his people at home and show him the pictures tacked over his bed those of his old mother with her white cap and of the young sister who was soon to be married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on sundays carl followed tom and her family to church waiting until they had left the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he always sat far back near the door so that he could see them come out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he would overtake pop with patsy whenever the little fellow could go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was not often for now there were many days when the boy had to lie all day on the lounge in the sittingroom poring over his books or playing with stumpy brought into the kitchen to amuse him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since the day of toms warning look carl rarely joined her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennie would loiter by the way speaking to the girls but he would hang back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt that tom did not want them together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one spring morning however a new complication arose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a morning when the sky was a delicate violetblue when the sunlight came tempered through a tender land haze and a filmy mist from the still sea when all the air was redolent with sweet smells of coming spring and all the girls were gay in new attire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dennis quigg had been lounging outside the church door his silk hat and green satin necktie glistening in the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the look on his face as with swinging shoulders he slouched beside her sent a thrill of indignation through carl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could give her up perhaps if tom insisted but never to a man like quigg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall come again and it is not certain that we shall then part any better friends than we are now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> atli rejoined i shall stay at home and abide whatever comes to hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the workmen came back in the evening atli told them of his conversation with thorbjorn and said to ali that he must go his own ways for he was not going to be drawn into a quarrel for employing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ali said true is the ancient saying the overpraised are the worst deceivers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not think that you would have turned me off now after i had worked here till i broke in the summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought that you would have given me protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such is your way however you play the beneficent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i shall be beaten before your very eyes if you refuse to stand by me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> atlis mind was changed after the man had spoken he no longer wanted to drive him away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the time passed until the hayharvest began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day a little before midsummer thorbjorn oxmain rode to bjarg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore a helmet on his head a sword was girt at his side and in his hand was a spear which had a very broad blade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the weather was rainy atli had sent his men to mow the hay and some were in the north at horn on some work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> atli was at home with a few men only <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorbjorn arrived alone towards midday and rode up to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door was shut and no one outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorbjorn knocked at the door and then went to the back of the house so that he could not be seen from the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people in the house heard some one knocking and one of the women went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorbjorn got a glimpse of the woman but did not let himself be seen for he was seeking another person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went back into the room and atli asked her who had come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they were speaking thorbjorn struck a violent blow on the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> atli he wants to see me perhaps he has some business with me for he seems very pressing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he went to the outer door and saw nobody there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was raining hard so he did not go outside but stood holding both the doorposts with his hands and peering round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that moment thorbjorn sidled round to the front of the door and thrust his spear with both hands into atlis middle so that it pierced him through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> atli said when he received the thrust they use broad spearblades nowadays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the women who were inside came out and saw that he was dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorbjorn had then mounted his horse he proclaimed the slaying and rode home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asdis the mistress of the house sent for men atlis body was laid out and he was buried beside his father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was much lamentation over his death for he was both wise and beloved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no bloodmoney was paid for his death nor was any demanded for his representative was grettir if he should ever return to iceland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorbjorn gained little credit by this deed but remained quietly at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that same summer before the assembly of the thing there came a ship out to gasar bringing news of grettir and of his house burning adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorir of gard was very angry when he heard of it and bethought himself of vengeance for his sons upon grettir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorir rode with a large retinue to the thing and laid a complaint in respect of the burning but men thought nothing could be done as long as there was no one to answer the charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorir insisted that he would be content with nothing short of banishment for grettir from the whole country after such a crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then skapti the lawman said it certainly was an evil deed if all really happened as has been told <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but one mans tale is but half a tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most people try and manage not to improve a story if there is more than one version of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hold that no judgment should be passed for grettirs banishment without further proceedings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorir was a notable person and possessed great influence in the district many powerful men were his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pressed his suit so strongly that nothing could be done to save grettir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorir had him proclaimed an outlaw throughout the country and was ever afterwards the most bitter of his opponents as he often found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having put a price upon his head as it was usual to do with other outlaws he rode home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many said that the decree was carried more by violence than by law but it remained in force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later in the summer grettir the son of asmund came back to iceland landing in the hvita in borgarfjord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people about the district went down to the ship and all the news came at once upon grettir first that his father was dead then that his brother was slain and third that he was declared outlaw throughout the all fell at once upon the bard exile father dead and brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many an one who breaks the swords shall smart for this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is told that grettir changed his manner no whit for these tidings but was just as merry as before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remained on board his ship for a time because he could not get a horse to suit him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a man named sveinn who dwelt at bakki up from thingnes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a good bondi and a merry companion he often composed verses which it was a delight to listen to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a brown mare the swiftest of horses which he called saddlehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once grettir left vellir in the night because he did not wish the traders to know of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got a black cape and put it over his clothes to conceal himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went up past thingnes to bakki by which time it was light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing a brown horse in the meadow he went up and put a bridle on it mounted on its back and rode up along the hvita river below baer on to the river flokadalsa and up to the road above kalfanes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men working at bakki were up by then and told the bondi that a man was riding his horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there rode a man upon saddleheads back close to the garth the thief has come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frey of the odins cloud dreadful of aspect appears from his strength to be busy with mischief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he took a horse and rode after him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grettir rode on till he came to the settlement at kropp where he met a man named halli who said he was going down to the ship at vellir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grettir then tell oh tell in the dwellings abroad tell thou hast met with saddlehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the handler of dice in sable cowl sat on his back hasten oh halli <end> <end> 
<start> <start> halli went along the road as far as kalfanes before he met sveinn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned paler and opened it hurriedly but looking over it and seeing generally what it was became less hurried recovered his brother hawkyard then said in a livelier strain you must know george that brother gimblet and i are going to make our two businesses one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brother gimblet is to take one clear half of the profits o d.v. <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said brother gimblet with his right fist firmly clinched on his right leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no objection pursued brother hawkyard to my reading as it was what i expressly desired should be done after yesterdays prayer i more than readily begged him to read it aloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so ingenious yet simple and i confess i laughed over my first skiff on the stalk and fell to bantering the martians asking whether it was a good season for navies whether their cunarders were spreading nicely if they could give me a pinch of barge seed or a yacht in bud to show to my friends at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but those lazy people took the matter seriously enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they led me down green alleys arched over with huge melonlike leaves they led me along innumerable byways making me peep and peer through the chequered sunlight at oceangrowing craft that had budded twelve months before already filling their moulds to the last inch of space <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they told me that when the growing process was sufficiently advanced they loosened the casing and cutting a hole into the interior of each giant fruit scooped out all its seed thereby checking more advance and throwing into the rind strength that would otherwise have gone to reproductive ness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they said each fruit made two vessels but the upper half was always best and used for long saltwater jour neys the lower piece being but for punting or fishing on their lakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they cut them in half while still green scraped out the light remaining pulp when dry and dragged them down with the minimum of trouble light as feathers ten acious as steel plate and already in the form and fashion of dainty craft from five to twenty feet in length when the process was completed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time we had explored this strangest of ship building yards and i had seen last years crop on the stocks being polished and fitted with seats and gear the sun was going down and the martian twilight owing to the comparative steepness of the little planets sides being brief we strolled back to the village and there they gave me harbourage for the night ambrosial supper and a deep draught of the wine of forgetfulness under the gauzy spell of which the real and unreal melted into the vistas of rosy oblivion and i slept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the new morning came fresh energy and a spasm of conscience as i thought of poor heru and the shabby sort of rescuer i was to lie about with these pretty triflers while she remained in peril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i had a bath and a swim a breakfast and to my shame be it acknowledged a sort of farewell merrygo round dance on the yellow sands with a dozen young persons all lighthearted as the morning beautiful as the flowers that bound their hair and in the extremity of statuesque attire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then at last i got them to give me a seagoing canoe a stock of cakes and fresh water and with many parting in junctions how to find the woodman trail since i would not listen to reason and lie all the rest of my life with them in the sunshine they pushed me off on my lonely voyage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they shouted in chorus as i dipped my paddle into the diamondcrested wavelets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six hours adventurous stranger with the sun behind you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then into the broad river behind the yellow sandbar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the strong black river above all things stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for that is the river of the dead by which many go but none come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and waving them adieu i sternly turned my eyes from delights behind and faced the fascination of perils in front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in four hours for the martians had forgotten in their calculations that my muscles were something better than theirs i rose the further shore and then the question was where ran that westward river of theirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it turned out afterwards that knowing nothing of their tides i had drifted much too far to northward and con sequently the coast had closed up the estuary mouth i should have entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a sign of an opening showed any where and having nothing whatever for guidance i turned northward eagerly scanning an endless line of low cliffs as the day lessened for the promised sandbar or inlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about dusk my canoe flying swiftly forward at its own sweet will brought me into a bight a bare desolatelooking country with no vegetation save grass and sedge on the near marshes and stony hills rising up beyond with others beyond them mounting step by step to a long line of ridges and peaks still covered in winter snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a trace of habitation had been seen for a long time not a single living being in whose neighbourhood i could land and ask the way nothing living anywhere but a monstrous kind of sea slug as big as a dog battening on the waterside garbage and gaunt birds like vultures who croaked on the mudflats and halfspread wings of funereal blackness as they gam bolled here and there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where those wild men who had taken the princess from us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the first stars of the martian sky were strange to me and my boat whirling round and round on the current con fused what little geography i might otherwise have retained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a cheerless look out and again and again i cursed my folly for coming on such a fools errand as i sat chin in hand staring at a landscape that grew more and more de pressing every mile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to go on looked like destruction to go back was almost impossible without a guide and while i was still wondering which of the two might be the lesser evil the stream i was on turned a corner and in a moment we were upon water which ran with swift oily smoothness straight for the snowranges now beginning to loom un pleasantly close ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time the night was coming on apace the last of the evillooking birds had winged its way across the red sunset glare and though it was clear enough in midriver under the banks now steep and unclimbable it was already evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with the darkness came a wondrous cold breath from off the icefields blowing through my lowland wrap pings as though they were but tissue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i munched a bit of honeycake took a cautious sip of wine and though i will not own i was frightened yet no one will deny that the cir cumstances were discouraging <end> <end> 
<start> <start> standing up in the frail canoe and looking around at the second glance an object caught my eye coming with the stream and rapidly overtaking me on a strong sluice of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a raft of some sort and something extra ordinarily like a sitting martian on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nearer and nearer it came bobbing to the rise and fall of each wavelet with the last icy sunlight touching it up with reds and golds nearer and nearer in the deadly hush of that forsaken region and then at last so near it showed quite plainly on the purple water a raft with some one sitting under a canopy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bounderby with his thumbs in the arms of his coat and jerking his head and shutting his eyes in confidence with the id leefer not coom to t sir but sin you put th question an not wantn t be illmannern ill answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ha passed a not to me you know said bounderby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gusty weather with as for me any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it said bounderby still in confidence with the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if only josiah bounderby of coketown had been in question you though he knows said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bounderby now blowing a gale that there are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harthouse you have been knocking about in the world some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bounderby pointed him out for inspection with an angry finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay maam said stephen blackpool staunchly protesting against the words that had been used and instinctively addressing himself to louisa after glancing at her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nowt o th kind maam nowt o th kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyve not doon me a kindness maam as i know and feel <end> <end>

<start> <start> go through with it while how tis maam resumed stephen appearing still to find his natural refuge in louisas face that what is best in us fok seems to turn us most to trouble an misfortn an mistake i dunno <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know tis as i know the heavens is over me ahint the smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were patient too an wants in general to do now my friend said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bounderby whom he could not have exasperated more quite unconscious of it though he was than by seeming to appeal to any one else if you will favour me with your attention for half a minute i should like to have a word or two with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said just now that you had nothing to tell us about this business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are quite sure of that before we go any heres a gentleman from london present mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> james harthouse with his thumb a parliament gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me instead of taking the substance of it for i know precious well beforehand what it will be nobody knows better than i do take notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of receiving it on stephen bent his head to the gentleman from london and showed a rather more troubled mind than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned his eyes involuntarily to his former refuge but at a look from that quarter expressive though instantaneous he settled them on mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ha not coom here sir stephen reminded him to complain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bounderby folding his arms do you people stephen looked at him with some little irresolution for a moment and then seemed to make up his mind <end> <end>

<start> <start> look how this ha growen an growen sir bigger an bigger broader an broader harder an harder fro year to year fro generation unto generation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who can look on t sir of course said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now perhaps youll let the gentleman know how you would set this muddle as youre so fond of i donno sir <end> <end>

<start> <start> dont tell me we wont man said mr <end> <end>

<start> <start> put that clock aboard a ship an pack it off to norfolk island an the time will go on just the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reverting for a moment to his former refuge he observed a cautionary movement of her eyes towards the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stepping back he put his hand upon the lock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had not spoken out of his own will and desire and he felt it in his heart a noble return for his late injurious treatment to be faithful to the last to those who had repudiated him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stayed to finish what was in his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir i canna wi my little learning an my common way tell the genelman what will better aw this though some working men o this town could above my powers but i can tell him what i know will never do t <end> <end>

<start> <start> i told you the last time you were here with a grievance that you had better turn about and come out of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i also told you if you remember that i was up to the gold spoon look now its clear to me said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bounderby that you are one of those chaps who have always got a grievance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you go about sowing it and raising crops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the business of your life my stephen shook his head mutely protesting that indeed he had other business to do for his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are such a waspish raspish illconditioned chap you see said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bounderby that even your own union the men who know you best will have nothing to do with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never thought those fellows could be right in anything but i tell you what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i so far go along with them for a novelty that ill have nothing to do with stephen raised his eyes quickly to his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can finish off what youre at said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bounderby with a sir yo know weel said stephen expressively that if i canna the reply was what i know i know and what you know you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> third floor fronts the only thing ive got she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last young man i had burned holes in three of my sheets aubrey reassured her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> schiller brightened the gas and led the way upstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight of the six feet ascending together amused aubrey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fourth ninth tenth and fourteenth steps creaked as he had guessed they would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the landing of the second storey a transom gushed orange light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> schiller was secretly pleased at not having to augment the gas on that landing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under the transom and behind a door aubrey could hear someone having a bath with a great sloshing of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate he felt sure it was some experienced habitue of lodgings who knew that about five thirty in the afternoon is the best time for a bath before cooking supper and the homecoming ablutions of other tenants have exhausted the hot water boiler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room was small occupying half the thirdfloor frontage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a large window opened onto the street giving a plain view of the bookshop and the other houses across the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a washstand stood modestly inside a large cupboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the mantel was the familiar pictureusually however reserved for the fourth floor backof a young lady having her shoes shined by a ribald small boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> schiller was almost disconcerted by the rapidity of the transaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she preferred to solemnize the reception of a new lodger by a little more talkremarks about the weather the difficulty of getting help the young women guests who empty tealeaves down washbasin pipes and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this sort of gossip apparently aimless has a very real purpose it enables the defenceless landlady to size up the stranger who comes to prey upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had hardly had a good look at this gentleman nor even knew his name and here he had paid a weeks rent and was already installed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aubrey divined the cause of her hesitation and gave her his business card <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill send up the girl with some clean towels and a latchkey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aubrey sat down in a rocking chair by the window tucked the muslin curtain to one side and looked out upon the bright channel of gissing street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was full of the exhilaration that springs from any change of abode but his romantic satisfaction in being so close to the adorable titania was somewhat marred by a sense of absurdity which is feared by young men more than wounds and death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could see the lighted windows of the haunted bookshop quite plainly but he could not think of any adequate excuse for going over there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and already he realized that to be near miss chapman was not at all the consolation he had expected it would be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a powerful desire to see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned off the gas lit his pipe opened the window and focussed the opera glasses on the door of the bookshop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could see the table at the front of the shop rogers bulletin board under the electric light and one or two nondescript customers gleaning along the shelves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then something bounded violently under the third button of his shirt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the bright prismatic little circle of the lenses he could see titania <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heavenly creature in her white vnecked blouse and brown skirt there she was looking at a book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw her put out one arm and caught the twinkle of her wristwatch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the startling familiarity of the magnifying glass he could see her bright unconscious face the merry profile of her cheek and chin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of that girl working in a secondhand bookstore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took out his pyjamas and threw them on the bed put his toothbrush and razor on the washbasin laid hairbrushes and o <end> <end> 
<start> <start> feeling rather seriocomic he loaded his small revolver and hipped it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was six oclock and he wound his watch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a little uncertain what to do whether to keep a vigil at the window with the opera glasses or go down in the street where he could watch the bookshop more nearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the excitement of the adventure he had forgotten all about the cut on his scalp and felt quite chipper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in leaving madison avenue he had attempted to excuse the preposterousness of his excursion by thinking that a quiet weekend in brooklyn would give him an opportunity to jot down some tentative ideas for daintybits advertising copy which he planned to submit to his chief on monday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now that he was here he felt the impossibility of attacking any such humdrum task <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could he sit down in cold blood to devise any attentioncompelling layouts for daintybits tapioca and chapmans cherished saratoga chips when the daintiest bit of all was only a few yards away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time was made plain to him the amazing power of young women to interfere with the legitimate commerce of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did get so far as to take out his pad of writing paper and jot these delicate wafers crisped by a secret process cherish in their unique tang and flavour all the lifegiving nutriment that has made the potato the king of vegetablesbut the face of miss titania kept coming between his hand and brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of what avail to flood the world with chapman chips if the girl herself should come to any harm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was this the face that launched a thousand chips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he murmured and for an instant wished he had brought the oxford book of english verse instead of o <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a tap sounded at his door and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could it be for him he thought for no one knew he was there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the party on the wire asked to speak to the gentleman who arrived about half an hour ago and i guess you must be the one he means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mynheer had a chinese gong that could make more noise than a dozen breakfast bells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its hideous reveille clanging through the house generally startled the drowsiest lodgers into activity but the maiden would not allow it to be sounded this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let the brave young gentlemen sleep she said to the greasy kitchen boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they shall be warmly fed when they awaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was ten oclock when captain peter and his band came straggling down one by one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is high time we were before the court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will testify truly young masters that you found most excellent fare and lodging at the red lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course we will answered carl saucily and pleasant company too though they visit at rather unseasonable hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was all the answer mynheer made to this but the daughter was more communicative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shaking her earrings at carl she said sharply not so very pleasant either master traveler if you could judge by the way you ran away from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hissed carl under his breath as he began busily to examine his skate straps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime the kitchen boy listening outside at the crack of the door doubled himself with silent laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after breakfast the boys went to the police court accompanied by huygens kleef and his daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mynheers testimony was principally to the effect that such a thing as a robber at the red lion had been unheard of until last night and as for the red lion it was a most respectable inn as respectable as any house in leyden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each boy in turn told all that he knew of the affair and identified the prisoner in the box as the same man who entered their room in the dead of night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ludwig was surprised to find that the prisoner in the box was a man of ordinary sizeespecially after he had described him under oath to the court as a tremendous fellow with great square shoulders and legs of prodigious weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacob swore that he was awakened by the robber kicking and thrashing upon the floor and immediately afterward peter and the rest feeling sorry that they had not explained the matter to their sleepy comrade testified that the man had not moved a muscle from the moment the point of the dagger touched his throat until bound from head to foot he was rolled over for inspection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlords daughter made one boy blush and all the court smile by declaring if it hadnt been for that handsome young gentleman therepointing to peterthey might have all been murdered in their beds for the dreadful man had a great shining knife most as long as your honors arm and she believed the handsome young gentleman had struggled hard enough to get it away from him but he was too modest bless him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally after a little questioning and crossquestioning from the public prosecutor the witnesses were dismissed and the robber was handed over to the consideration of the criminal court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said carl savagely when the boys reached the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ought to be sent to jail at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had been in your place peter i certainly should have killed him outright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was fortunate then in falling into gentler hands was peters quiet reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appears he has been arrested before under a charge of housebreaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not succeed in robbing this time but he broke the doorfastenings and that i believe constitutes a burglary in the eyes of the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was armed with a knife too and that makes it worse for him poor fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he is my brother and yours too carl schummel for that matter answered peter looking into carls eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cannot say what we might have become under other circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have been bolstered up from evil since the hour we were born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a happy home and good parents might have made that man a fine fellow instead of what he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god grant that the law may cure and not crush him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said lambert heartily while ludwig van holp looked at his brother in such a bright proud way that jacob poot who was an only son wished from his heart that the little form buried in the old church at home had lived to grow up beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all very well to be saintly and forgiving and all that sort of thing but im naturally hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all these fine ideas seem to rattle off me like hailstonesand its nobodys business either if they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter recognized a touch of good feeling in this clumsy concession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holding out his hand he said in a frank hearty tone come lad shake hands and let us be good friends even if we dont exactly agree on all questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we do agree better than you think sulked carl as he returned peters grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answered lambert after holding a brief consultation with ben <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this open square before us said lambert as he and ben walked on together is pretty in summer with its shady trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> years ago it was covered with houses and the rapenburg canal here ran through the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well one day a barge loaded with forty thousand pounds of gunpowder bound for delft was lying alongside and the bargemen took a notion to cook their dinner on the deck and before anyone knew it sir the whole thing blew up killing lots of persons and scattering about three hundred houses to the winds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes sir my father was in leyden at the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the explosion occurred just at noon and it was like a volcano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this part of the town was on fire in an instant buildings tumbling down and men women and children groaning under the ruins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king himself came to the city and acted nobly father says staying out in the streets all night encouraging the survivors in their efforts to arrest the fire and rescue as many as possible from under the heaps of stone and rubbish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through his means a collection for the benefit of the sufferers was raised throughout the kingdom besides a hundred thousand guilders paid out of the treasury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in i believe but he remembers it perfectly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a friend of his professor luzac was among the killed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have a tablet erected to his memory in saint peters church farther onthe queerest thing you ever saw with an image of the professor carved upon it representing him just as he looked when he was found after the explosion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain delighted ben by saying that the monument was there and that he thought they might be able to see it during the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lambert continued peter ask ben if he saw van der werfs portrait at the town hall last night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said lambert i can answer for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say boys it is really wonderful how much ben knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why he has told me a volume of dutch history already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill wager he has the siege of leyden at his tongues end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tongue must burn then interposed ludwig for if bilderdyks account is true it was a pretty hot affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben was looking at them with an inquiring smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are speaking of the siege of leyden explained lambert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes said ben eagerly i had forgotten all about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets give old van der werf three cheers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and explained that patriotic as the dutch were the police would soon have something to say if a party of boys cheered in the street at midday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt he hold out against those murderous spaniards for months and months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the town surrounded on all sides by the enemy great black forts sending fire and death into the very heart of the citybut no surrender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every man a herowomen and children too brave and fierce as lions provisions giving out the very grass from between the paving stones gonetill people were glad to eat horses and cats and dogs and rats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came the plaguehundreds dying in the streetsbut no surrender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when they could bear no more when the people brave as they were crowded about van der werf in the public square begging him to give up what did the noble old burgomaster say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have sworn to defend this city and with gods help i mean to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if my body can satisfy your hunger take it and divide it among you but expect no surrender so long as i am alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gone disappeared swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went forward and ordered the chain to be hauled in short so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will all be butchered in this fog murmured another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the faces twitched with the strain the hands trembled slightly the eyes forgot to wink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was very curious to see the contrast of ex pressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew who were as much strangers to that part of the river as we though their homes were only eight hundred miles away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whites of course greatly discomposed had besides a curious look of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others had an alert naturally interested expression but their faces were es sentially quiet even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the chain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several exchanged short grunting phrases which seemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their headman a young broad chested black severely draped in darkblue fringed cloths with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up art fully in oily ringlets stood near me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> catch im he snapped with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teethcatch im <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked what would you do with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said curtly and leaning his elbow on the rail looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would no doubt have been properly horrified had it not occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very hungry that they must have been growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had been engaged for six months i dont think a single one of them had any clear idea of time as we at the end of countless ages have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they still be longed to the beginnings of timehad no inherited ex perience to teach them as it were and of course as long as there was a piece of paper written over in ac cordance with some farcical law or other made down the river it didnt enter anybodys head to trouble how they would live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippomeat which couldnt have lasted very long anyway even if the pilgrims hadnt in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo thrown a considerable quantity of it overboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looked like a highhanded proceed ing but it was really a case of legitimate selfdefense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant breathe dead hippo waking sleeping and eating and at the same time keep your precarious grip on existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides that they had given them every week three pieces of brass wire each about nine inches long and the theory was they were to buy their pro visions with that currency in riverside villages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were either no villages or the people were hostile or the director who like the rest of us fed out of tins with an occasional old hegoat thrown in didnt want to stop the steamer for some more or less recondite reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so unless they swallowed the wire itself or made loops of it to snare the fishes with i dont see what good their extravagant salary could be to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and honorable trading company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the rest the only thing to eatthough it didnt look eat able in the leasti saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like halfcooked dough of a dirty lavender color they kept wrapped in leaves and now and then swallowed a piece of but so small that it seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any seri ous purpose of sustenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they didnt go for usthey were thirty to fiveand have a good tuck in for once amazes me now when i think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were big powerful men with not much capacity to weigh the con sequences with courage with strength even yet though their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no longer hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the world was nowhere as far as our eyes and ears were concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gone disappeared swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went forward and ordered the chain to be hauled in short so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary <end> <end>

<start> <start> it is the lure of the cityand the lurelessness of the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town the young people leave is the town the young people ought to leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody says the reason so many young people go to hell is because they have no other place to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the matter with the small town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not blame it all upon the city mail order house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with rural delivery daily papers telephones centralized schools automobiles and good roads there are no more delightful places in the world to live than in the country or in the small town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have the city advantages plus sunshine air and freedom that the crowded cities cannot have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked the keeper who was showing me thru the insane asylum at weston west virginia you say you have nearly two thousand insane people in this institution and only a score of guards to keep them in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is to hinder these insane people from getting together organizing overpowering the few guards and breaking out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the keeper was not in the least alarmed at the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if these people could get together they wouldnt be in this asylum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no two of them can agree upon how to get together and how to break out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so a few of us can hold them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be almost unkind to carry this further but i have been thinking ever since that about threefourths of the small towns of america have one thing in common with the asylum folksthey cant get together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they break up into little antagonistic social business and even religious factions and neutralize each others efforts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a lot of struggling churches compete with each other instead of massing for the common good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the churches fight the devil stays neutral and furnishes the munitions for both sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the home towns stagnate and the young people with visions go away to the cities where opportunity seems to beckon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ninetynine out of a hundred of them will jostle with the straphangers all their lives mere wheels turning round in a huge machine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ninetynine out of a hundred of them might have had a larger opportunity right back in the home town had the town been awake and united and inviting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must make the home town the brightest most attractive most promising place for the young people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no home town can afford to spend its years raising crops of young people for the cities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the worst kind of soil impoverishmentall going out and nothing coming back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the drain that devitalizes the home towns more than all the city mail order houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> america is to be great not in the greatness of a few crowded cities but in the greatness of innumerable home towns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slogan today should be for god and home and the home town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry solomon lehr founder of the ohio northern university at ada ohio one of ohios greatest educators used to say with pride our students come to school they are not sent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he encouraged his students to be selfsupporting and most of them were working their way thru school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made the school calendar and courses elastic to accommodate them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the need of combining the school of books with the school of struggle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he organized his school into competing groups so that the student who had no struggle in his life would at least have to struggle with the others during his schooling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he organized great literary and debating societies to compete with each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his school was one surging mass of contestants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rather he felt that he was initiating an individual or class effort to win <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the literary societies vied with each other in their programs and in getting new members going every term to unbelievable efforts to win over the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would go miles out on the trains to intercept new students even to their homes in other states <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each old student pledged new students in his home country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the military companies turned the school into a military camp for weeks each year scarcely sleeping while drilling for a contest flag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those students went out into the world trained to struggle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the letter that linda read once then she read it again and then she read it a third time and after that she lost count and reread it whenever she was not busy doing something else for it was a letter that was the next thing to laying hands upon marian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the part of the letter concerning the unknown man who was writing marian linda pondered over deeply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the best thing i ever did in my life she said in self commendation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its doing more than i hoped it would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without saying a word about john gilman it is making her see for herself the weak spots in him through the very subtle method of calling her attention to the strength that may lie in another man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for once in your life linda you have done something strictly worth while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing for you to do is to keep it up and in order to keep it up to make each letter fresh and original you will have to do a good deal of sticking around peter morrisons location and absorbing rather thoroughly the things he says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter doesnt know he is writing those letters but he is in them till its a wonder marian does not hear him drawl and see the imps twisting his lips as she reads them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before i write another single one ill go see peter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill take a pencil and as he reads ill jot down the salient points and then ill come home and work out a head and tail piece for him to send in with it and in that way ill ease my soul about the skylight and the fireplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so linda took pad and pencils raided katy for everything she could find that was temptingly edible climbed into the bear cat and went to see peter as frankly as she would have crossed the lawn to visit marian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not in the garage when she stopped her car before it but the workmen told her that he had strolled up the mountain and that probably he would return soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> learning that he had been gone but a short time linda set the bear cat squalling at the top of its voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she took possession of the garage and clearing peters worktable spread upon it the food she had brought and then started out to find some flowers for decorations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when peter came upon the scene he found linda flushed and brilliant eyed holding before him a big bouquet of alder bloom the last of the lilacs she had found in a cool shaded place pink filaree blue lupin and white mahogany panicles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant guess what i have been doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no it isnt said linda because i am capable of two processes at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the work of my hands is visible with it i am going to decorate your table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wont have to go down to the restaurant for your supper tonight because i have brought my supper up to share with you and after we finish youre going to read me your article as you have rewritten it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going to decorate it and we are going to make a hit with it that will be at least a start on the road to greater fame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can pick it up smell it admire it and eat it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what i have truly been doing is setting spanish iris for yards down one side of the bed of your stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i left it was a foot and a half high peter and every blue that the sky ever knew in its loveliest moments and a yellow that is the concentrated essence of the best gold from the heart of california <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh peter there is enchantment in the way i set it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are irregular deep beds and there are straggly places where there are only one or two in a ragged streak and then it runs along the edge in a fringy rim and then it stretches out in a marshy place that is going to have some other wild things arrowheads and orchids and maybe a bunch of paint brush on a high dry spot near by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter looked at linda reflectively and then he told her that he could see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fold her that he adored it that he was crazy about her straggly continuity and her fringy border but there was not one word of truth in what he said because what he saw was a slender thing willowy graceful roughened wavy black hair hanging half her length in heavy braids dark eyes and bright cheeks a vivid red line of mouth and a bright brown line of freckles bridging a prominent and aristocratic nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he was seeing was a soul a young thing a thing he coveted with every nerve and fiber of his being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and while he glibly humored her in her vision of decorating his brook in his own consciousness he was saying to himself is there any reason why i should not try for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing ugly that could offend her or hurt her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reason the real reason probably lies in the fact that if she were thinking of caring for anyone it would be for that attractive young schoolmate she brought up here for me to exercise my wits upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very likely that she regards me in the light of a grandfatherly person to whom she can come with her joys or her problems as frankly as she has now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so peter asked if the irises crossed the brook and ran down both sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> linda sat on a packing case and concentrated on the iris and finally she announced that they did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she informed him that his place was going to bc natural that nature evolved things in her own way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not grow irises down one side of a brook and arrowheads down the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they waded across and flew across and visited back and forth riding the water or the wind or the down of a bee or the tail of a cow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she served the supper she had brought she very gravely informed him that there would be iris on both sides of his brook and cress and miners lettuce under the bridge and she knew exactly where the wild clematis grew that would whiten his embankment after his workmen had extracted the last root of poison oak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may not scorch you peter she said gravely but you must look out for the missus and the little things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent definitely decided on her yet but she looks a good deal like mary louise whiting to mc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i liked her looks so well that i said to myself everybody talks about how fine she is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt wonder if i had better save her for peter but if i decide to you should act that poison stuff out because its sure as shooting to attack any one with the soft delicate skin that goes with a golden head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh lets leave it in said peter and dispense with the golden head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time you get that stream planted as youre planning ill have become so accustomed to a dark head bobbing up and down beside it that i wont take kindly to a sorrel top <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is positively sacrilegious said linda lifting her hands to her rough black hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never in my life saw anything lovelier than the rich gold on louise whitings bare head as she bent to release her brakes and start her car <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a black head looks like a cinder bed beside it and only think what a sunburst it will be when mary louise kneels down beside the iris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they had finished their supper linda gathered up the remnants and put them in the car then she laid a notebook and pencil on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i want to hear that article she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew you would do it over the minute i was gone and i knew you would keep it to read to me before you sent it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it second sight or psychoanalysis or telepathy or what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the workmen are gone and everything is quiet now peter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am crazy to get the particular angle from which you make the world safe for democracy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john used to call our attention to your articles during the war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said we had not sent another man to france who could write as humanely and as interestingly as you did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i had kept those articles because i didnt get anything from them to compare with what i can get since i have a slight acquaintance with the procession that marches around your mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter you will have to watch that mouth of yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so long as its occupied with politics and the fads and the foibles and the sins and the foolishness and the extravagances of humanity its all very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you ever get in trouble or if ever your heart hurts or you get mad enough to kill somebody that mouth of yours is going to be a most awfully revealing feature peter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will have hard work to settle it down into hardandfast noncommittal lines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i specialize i use a pin and a microscope and go right to the root of matters as i was taught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well if this is extemporizing said peter god help my soul if you ever go at me with a pin and a microscope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wouldnt be kind to pin your friends on a setting board and use a microscope on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might see things that were strictly private <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might see things they wouldnt want you to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they might not be your friends any more if you did that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i make a friend i just take him on trust like i did donald <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put me to any test you can think of if you want proof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont believe in proving friends either said linda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would set a friend in my garden and water his feet and turn the sunshine on him and tell him to stay there and grow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might fertilize him i might prune him and i might use insecticide on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might spray him with rather stringent solutions but i give you my word i would not test him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he flourished under my care i would know it and if he did not i would know it and that would be all i would want to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have watched daddy search for the seat of nervous disorders and sometimes he had to probe very deep to find what developed nerves unduly but he didnt ever do any picking and raveling and fringing at the soul of a human being merely for the sake of finding out what it was made of and everyone says i am like him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i might have known him said peter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter opened a packing case picked out a sheaf of papers and sitting opposite linda began to read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was dumbfounded to find that he a man who had read and talked extemporaneously before great bodies of learned men should have cold feet and shaking hands and a hammering heart because he was trying to read an article on america for americans before a highschool junior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but presently as the theme engrossed him he forgot the vision of linda interesting herself in his homemaking and saw instead a vision of his country threatened on one side by the red menace of the bolshevik on the other by the yellow menace of the jap and yet on another by the treachery of the mexican and the slowly uprising might of the black man and presently he was thundering his bestconsidered arguments at linda until she imperceptibly drew back from him on the packing case and with parted lips and wide eyes she listened in utter absorption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gazed at a transformed peter with aroused eyes and a white light of patriotism on his forehead and a conception even keener than anything that the war had brought her young soul was burning in her heart of what a man means when he tries to express his feeling concerning the land of his birth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently without realizing what she was doing she reached for her pad and pencils and rapidly began sketching a stretch of peaceful countryside over which a coming storm of gigantic proportions was gathering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fired by peters article the touch of genius in lindas soul became creative and she fashioned huge storm clouds wind driven that floated in such a manner as to bring the merest suggestion of menacing faces black faces yellow faces brown faces and under the flash of lightning just at the obscuring of the sun a huge evil leering red face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she swept a stroke across her sheet and below this she began again sketching the same stretch of country she had pictured above strolling in cultivated fields dotting it with white cities connecting it with smooth roadways sweeping the sky with giant planes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at one side winging in from the glow of morning she drew in the strongwinged flight of a flock of sea swallows peacefully homing toward the fardistant ocean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was utterly unaware when peter stopped reading <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant do well on color with pencils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you hold that article till i have time to put this on watercolor paper and touch it up a bit here and there and i believe it will be worthy of starting and closing your article <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes little is good scoffed linda rising to very nearly his height and reaching for the lunch basket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could do what i like to myself i would get in some kind of a press and squash down about seven inches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats the difference what the inches of your body are so long as your brain has a stature worthy of mention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the strength of that ill jazz that sketch all up bluey and redpurple and jadegreen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i make it as glorious as a catalina sunset <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thar nuver was a word agin rosie afore thar haint been sence an you kin ride up an down this river till the crack o doom an youll nuver hear a word agin her agin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fer as i tol you my boy jim is the shoot ines feller on this crick i reckon cept one an stranger thats me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a drove of lean cattle were swinging easily over black mountain and behind them came a big man with wild black hair and a bushy beard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then he would gnaw at his mustache with his long yellow teeth or would sit down to let his lean horse rest and would flip meaninglessly at the bushes with a switch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes his bushy head would droop over on his breast and he would snap it up sharply and start painfully on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because youre brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come along here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why a mans safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind as long as its daytime and youre not behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you clear through was born and raised in the south and ive lived in the north so i know the average all around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the south one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime and robbed the lot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people whereas youre just as brave and no braver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because theyre afraid the mans friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and its just what they would do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your mistake is that you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and the other is that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you brought part of a man buck harkness there and if you hadnt had him to start you youd a taken it out in blowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the average man dont like trouble and danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if only half a man like buck harkness there shouts lynch him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre afraid to back down afraid youll be found out to be what you are cowards and so you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that halfamans coattail and come raging up here swearing what big things youre going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pitifulest thing out is a mob thats what an army is a mob they dont fight with courage thats born in them but with cour age thats borrowed from their mass and from their officers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any real lynchings going to be done it will be done in the dark southern fashion and when they come theyll bring their masks and fetch a man along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now leave and take your halfaman with you tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didnt want to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by and then dived in under the tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had my twentydollar gold piece and some other money but i reckoned i better save it because there aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home and amongst strangers that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint opposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way but there aint no use in wasting it on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable there must a been twenty of them and every lady with a lovely complexion and per fectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real sureenough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars and just littered with diamonds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a powerful fine sight i never see anything so lovely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then one by one they got up and stood and went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their heads bobbing and skimming along away up there under the tentroof and every ladys roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking like the most loveliest parasol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more and more and the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole cracking his whip and shouting hi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the clown crack ing jokes behind him and by and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he ever could think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what i couldnt noway understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i couldnt a thought of them in a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring said he wanted to ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole show come to a standstill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that stirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring saying knock him down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and one or two women begun to scream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so everybody laughed and said all right and the man got on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the minute he was on the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at last sure enough all the circus men could do the horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and then tother one on tother side and the people just crazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it warnt funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle areeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the horse agoing like a house afire too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he just stood up there asailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warnt ever drunk in his life and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then there he was slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum and finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off to the dressingroom and everybody just ahowling with pleasure and astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see i reckon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why it was one of his own men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldnt a been in that ringmasters place not for a thousand dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but i never struck them yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyways it was plenty good enough for me and wherever i run across it it can have all of my custom every time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well that night we had our show but there warnt only about twelve people there just enough to pay expenses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they laughed all the time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the show was over but one boy which was asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to shakespeare what they wanted was low comedy and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he reckoned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over at the court house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the london and continental theatres in their thrilling tragedy of the kings cameleopard or the royal nonesuch admission cents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then at the bottom was the biggest line of all which ladies and children not admitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there says he if that line dont fetch them i dont know arkansaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was jam full of men in no time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the place couldnt hold no more the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was and so he went on a bragging about the tragedy and about edmund kean the elder which was to play the main principal part in it and at last when hed got everybodys expecta tions up high enough he rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come aprancing out on all fours naked and he was painted all over ring streakedandstriped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and but never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hawed till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says the great tragedy will be per formed only two nights more on accounts of pressing london engagements where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and rose up mad and was agoing for that stage and them tragedians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and hold on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we dont want to be the laughing stock of this whole town i reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a red shield with a golden eagle saith perceval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and more by token never made i acquaintance with any so sturdy in battle as are he and lancelot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fair sir it pleaseth you to say so saith messire gawain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the red launde was i at the assembly and such arms bore i as these you blazon and i jousted against a knight in white arms of whom i know this that all of knighthood that may be lodged in the body of a man is in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir saith perceval to messire gawain you know not how to blame any man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir saith messire gawain when you were in the court of king arthur for the shield that is within yonder your sister was also there and prayed and besought the help of the knight that should bear away the shield as being the most discounselled damsel in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king granted it her and you bore away the shield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked your aid of the king as she that deemed not you were her brother and said that if the king failed of his covenant he would do great sin whereof would he have much blame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king was fain to do all he might to seek you to make good that he had said and sent us forth in quest of you so that the quest lieth between me and lancelot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he himself would have come had we been unwilling to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir i have found you three times without knowing you albeit great desire had i to see you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the fourth time and i know you now whereof i make myself right joyous and much am i beholden to you of the fair lodging your mother gave me at camelot but right sore pity have i of her for a right worshipful woman is she and a widow lady and ancient and fallen into much war without aid nor comfort through the evil folk that harass her and reave her of her castles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she prayed me weeping the while right sweetly that and if i should find you that are her son i should tell you of her plight that your father is dead and that she hath no succour nor aid to look for save from you alone and if you succour her not shortly she will lose her own one castle that she holdeth and must needs become a beggar for of the fifteen castles she wont to have in your fathers time she hath now only that of camelot nor of all her knights hath she but five to guard the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore i pray you on her behalf and for your own honour that you will grant her herein of your counsel and your valour and your might for of no chivalry that you may do may you rise to greater worship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so sore need hath she herein as you hear me tell nor would i that she should lose aught by default of message for thereof should i have sin and she harm and you yourself also that have the power to amend it and ought of right so to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well have you delivered yourself herein saith perceval and betimes will i succour her and our lord god will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will do honour to yourself saith messire gawain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereof will you have praise with god and worship with the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well know i saith perceval that in me ought she to have aid and counsel as of right and that so i do not accordingly i ought to have reproach and be blamed as recreant before the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in gods name saith the hermit you speak according to the scripture for he that honoureth not his father and mother neither believeth in god nor loveth him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this know i well saith perceval and well pleased am i to be reminded thereof and well know i also mine intent herein albeit i tell it to none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if any can tell me tidings of lancelot right willingly shall i hear them and take it kindly of the teller thereof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir saith joseus it is but just now since he lay here within and asked me tidings of messire gawain and i told him such as i knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another time before that he lay here when the robbers assailed us that he hanged in the forest and so hated is he thereof of their kinsfolk that and they may meet him so they have the might he is like to pay for it right dear and in this forest won they rather than in any other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him as much but he made light thereof in semblant even as he will in deed also if their force be not too great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by my head saith perceval i will not depart forth of this forest until i know tidings of him if messire gawain will pledge himself thereto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and messire saith he desireth nothing better sith that he hath found perceval for he may not be at ease until such time as he shall know tidings of lancelot for he hath great misgiving sith that he hath enemies in the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perceval and messire gawain sojourned that day in the forest in the hermitage and the morrow perceval took his shield that he brought from king arthurs court and left that which he brought with him and messire gawain along with him that made himself right joyous of his company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ride amidst the forest both twain all armed and at the right hour of noon they meet a knight that was coming a great gallop as though he were all scared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perceval asketh him whence he cometh that he seemeth so adread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir i come from the forest of the robbers that won in this forest wherethrough you have to pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have chased me a full league welsh to slay me but they would not follow me further for a knight that they have beset in one of their holds that hath done them right sore mischief for he hath hanged four of their knights and slain one as well as the fairest damsel that was in the kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but right well had she deserved the death for that she harboured knights with fair semblant and showed them much honour and afterward brought about their death and destruction between herself and a dwarf that she hath that slew the knights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir saith the knight not i for no leisure had i to ask him for sorer need had i to flee than to stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i tell you that on account of the meat that failed him in the hold wherein they beset him he issued forth raging like a lion nor would he have suffered himself be shut up so long but for two wounds that he had upon his body for he cared not to issue forth of the house until such time as they were healed and also for that he had no horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so soon as he felt himself whole he ventured himself against the four knights that were so adread of him that they durst not come anigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and moreover he deigneth not to go afoot wherefore if they now come anigh it may not be but he shall have one at least out of their four horses but they hold them heedfully aloof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were fain to depart from the knight but said he ha lords allow me so much as to see the destruction of this evil folk that have wrought such mischief in this forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir saith he to messire gawain i am cousin to the poor knight of the waste forest that hath the two poor damsels to sister there where you and lancelot jousted between you and when the knight that brought you tidings thereof died in the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by my faith saith messire gawain these tidings know i well for you say true and your company hold i right dear for the love of the poor knight for never yet saw i more courteous knight nor more courteous damsels nor better nurtured and our lord god grant them as much good as i would they should have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> messire gawain made the knight go before for well knew he the robbers hold but loath enough had he been to go thither had the knights not followed him behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lancelot was issued forth of the hold sword in hand all armed angry as a lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the four knights were upon their horses all armed but no mind had they come anigh him for sore dreaded they the huge buffets he dealt and his hardiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them came forward before the others and it seemed him shame that they might not vanquish one single knight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he goeth to smite lancelot a great stroke of his sword above in the midst of his head nor did lancelots sword fail of its stroke for before he could draw back lancelot dealt him such a blow as smote oft all of his leg at the thigh so that he made him leave the saddlebows empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lancelot leapt up on the destrier and now seemed him he was safer than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the three robberknights that yet remained whole ran upon him on all sides and began to press him of their swords in right sore wrath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon behold you the knight cometh to the way that goeth to the hold and saith to messire gawain and perceval now may you hear the dashing of swords and the melly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therewithal the two good knights smite horse with spur and come thither where the three robberknights were assailing lancelot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each of the twain smiteth his own so wrathfully that they thrust their spears right through their bodies and bear them to the ground dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howbeit the third knight was fain to flee but the knight that had come to show messire gawain the way took heart and hardiment from the confidence of the good knights and smote him as he fled so sore that he pierced him with his spear to the heart and toppled him to the ground dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the one whose leg lancelot had lopped off was so trampled underfoot of the knights that he had no life in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when lancelot knew perceval and messire gawain he made great joy of them and they of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lancelot saith messire gawain this knight that led us hither to save your life is cousin to the poor knight of the waste castle the brother of the two poor damsels that lodged us so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will send him these horses one for the knight that shall be the messenger and the two to the lord of the waste castle and this hold that we have taken shall be for the two damsels and so shall we make them safe all the days of their life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certes saith perceval you speak of great courtesy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir saith lancelot messire gawain hath said and right willingly will i grant him all his wish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lords saith the knight they have in this forest a hold wherein the knights did bestow their plunder for the sake whereof they murdered the passers by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the goods remain there they will be lost for therein is so great store as might be of much worth to many folk that are povertystricken for want thereof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they go to the hold and find right great treasure in a cave underground and rich sets of vessels and rich ornaments of cloth and armours for horses that they had thrown the one over another into a pit that was right broad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certes saith he right well hath it been done to this evil folk that is destroyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir saith lancelot in like manner would they have dealt with me and killed me if they might whereof no sorrow have i save of the damsel that i slew that was one of the fairest dames of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i slew her not knowingly for i meant rather to strike the knight but she leapt between us like the hardiest dame that saw i ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sirs saith the knight perceval and lancelot by the counsel of messire gawain granted the treasure to the two damsels sisters to the poor knight of the waste castle whereupon let them send for joseus the hermit and bid him guard the treasure until they shall come hither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and joseus said that he would do so and is right glad that the robbers of the forest are made away withal that had so often made assault upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he guarded the treasure and the hold right safely in the forest but the dread and the renown of the good knights that had freed the forest went far and wide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the knight that led the three destriers was right joyfully received at the waste castle and when he told the message wherewith he was charged by messire gawain the poor knight and two damsels made great joy thereof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perceval taketh leave of messire gawain and lancelot and saith that never will he rest again until he shall have found his sister and his widow mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they durst not gainsay him for they know well that he is right and he prayeth them right sweetly that they salute the king and queen and all the good knights of the court for please god he will go see them at an early day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but first he was fain to fulfil the promise king arthur made to his sister for he would not that the king should be blamed in any place as concerning him nor by his default and he himself would have the greater blame therein and he succoured her not for the matter touched him nearer than it did king arthur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with that the good knight departeth and they commend him to god and he them in like sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> messire gawain and lancelot go their way back toward the court of king arthur and perceval goeth amidst strange forests until he cometh to a forest far away wherein so it seemed him he had never been before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he passed through a land that seemed him to have been laid waste for it was all void of folk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wild beast only seeth he there that ran through the open country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he entered into a forest in this waste country and found a hermitage in the combe of a mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he alighted without and heard that the hermit was singing the service of the dead and had begun the mass with a requiem betwixt him and his clerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looketh and seeth a pall spread upon the ground before the altar as though it were over a corpse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not enter the chapel armed wherefore he hearkened to the mass from without right reverently and showed great devotion as he that loved god much and was adread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the mass was sung and the hermit was disarmed of the armour of our lord he cometh to perceval and saluteth him and perceval him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir saith perceval for whom have you done such service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meseemed that the corpse lay therewithin for whom the service was ordained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have done it for lohot king arthurs son that lieth buried under this pall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will i tell you plainly saith the hermit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this wasted land about this forest wherethrough you have come is the beginning of the kingdom of logres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there wont to be therein a giant so big and horrible and cruel that none durst won within half a league round about and he destroyed the land and wasted it in such sort as you see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lohot was departed from the land and the court of king arthur his father in quest of adventure and by the will of god arrived at this forest and fought against logrin right cruel as he was and logrin against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it pleased god lohot vanquished him but lohot had a marvellous custom when he had slain a man he slept upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a knight of king arthurs court that is called kay the seneschal was come peradventure into this forest of logres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard the giant roar when lohot dealt him the mortal blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thither came he as fist as he might and found the kings son sleeping upon logrin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew his sword and therewith cut off lohots head and took the head and the body and set them in a coffin of stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that he hacked his shield to pieces with his sword that he should not be recognised then came he to the giant that lay dead and so cut oft his head that was right huge and hideous and hung it at his fore saddlebow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then went he to the court of king arthur and presented it to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king made great joy thereof and all they of the court and the king made broad his lands right freely for that he believed kay had spoken true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went saith the hermit on the morrow to the piece of land where the giant lay dead as a damsel came within here to tell me with right great joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found the corpse of the giant so big that i durst not come anigh it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the damsel led me to the coffin where the kings son was lying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked the head of me as her guerdon and i granted it to her willingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she set it forthwith in a coffer laden with precious stones that was all garnished within of balsams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that she helped me carry the body into this chapel and enshroud and bury it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bride and bridegroom are going to germany and the tyrol on their way to italy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i propose that we allow them a month to themselves and that we arrange to meet them afterwards in the north of italy say at venice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this proposal was received with great applause which was changed into shouts of laughter by no less a person than my dear old nurse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> westwick pronounced the word venice she started up among the servants at the lower end of the room and called out at the top of her voice go to our hotel ladies and gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on our money already and if you will only crowd the place and call for the best of everything it will be ten per cent in our pockets in no time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> westwick had no choice but to explain that he was concerned as a shareholder in a new hotel company at venice and that he had invested a small sum of money for the nurse not very considerately as i think in the speculation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hearing this the company by way of humouring the joke drank a new toastsuccess to the nurses hotel and a speedy rise in the dividend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the conversation returned in due time to the more serious question of the proposed meeting at venice difficulties began to present themselves caused of course by invitations for the autumn which many of the guests had already accepted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carburys family were at liberty to keep the proposed appointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on our side we were more at leisure to do as we pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry westwick decided to go to venice in advance of the rest to test the accommodation of the new hotel on the opening day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis westwick volunteered to follow him and after some persuasion lord and lady montbarry consented to a species of compromise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his lordship could not conveniently spare time enough for the journey to venice but he and lady montbarry arranged to accompany mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis westwick as far on their way to italy as paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five days since they took their departure to meet their travelling companions in london leaving me here in charge of the three dear children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they begged hard of course to be taken with papa and mamma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was thought better not to interrupt the progress of their education and not to expose them especially the two younger girls to the fatigues of travelling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have had a charming letter from the bride this morning dated cologne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cannot think how artlessly and prettily she assures me of her happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some people as they say in ireland are born to good luckand i think arthur barville is one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you next write i hope to hear that you are in better health and spirits and that you continue to like your employment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes had just closed and directed her letter when the eldest of her three pupils entered the room with the startling announcement that lord montbarrys travellingservant had arrived from paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alarmed by the idea that some misfortune had happened she ran out to meet the man in the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her face told him how seriously he had frightened her before she could speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres nothing wrong miss he hastened to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lord and my lady are enjoying themselves at paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they only want you and the young ladies to be with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> saying these amazing words he handed to agnes a letter from lady montbarry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dearest agnes she read i am so charmed with the delightful change in my lifeit is six years remember since i last travelled on the continentthat i have exerted all my fascinations to persuade lord montbarry to go on to venice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what is more to the purpose i have actually succeeded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has just gone to his room to write the necessary letters of excuse in time for the post to england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may you have as good a husband my dear when your time comes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the mean while the one thing wanting now to make my happiness complete is to have you and the darling children with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> montbarry is just as miserable without them as i amthough he doesnt confess it so freely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will have no difficulties to trouble you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis will deliver these hurried lines and will take care of you on the journey to paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kiss the children for me a thousand times and never mind their education for the present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pack up instantly my dear and i will be fonder of you than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your affectionate friend agnes folded up the letter and feeling the need of composing herself took refuge for a few minutes in her own room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her first natural sensations of surprise and excitement at the prospect of going to venice were succeeded by impressions of a less agreeable kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the recovery of her customary composure came the unwelcome remembrance of the parting words spoken to her by montbarrys widowwe shall meet againhere in england or there in venice it was an odd coincidence to say the least of it that the march of events should be unexpectedly taking agnes to venice after those words had been spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was the woman of the mysterious warnings and the wild black eyes still thousands of miles away in america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or was the march of events taking her unexpectedly too on the journey to venice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes started out of her chair ashamed of even the momentary concession to superstition which was implied by the mere presence of such questions as these in her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rang the bell and sent for her little pupils and announced their approaching departure to the household <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noisy delight of the children the inspiriting effort of packing up in a hurry roused all her energies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dismissed her own absurd misgivings from consideration with the contempt that they deserved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she worked as only women can work when their hearts are in what they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the travellers reached dublin that day in time for the boat to england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two days later they were with lord and lady montbarry at paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only the twentieth of september when agnes and the children reached paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norbury and her brother francis had then already started on their journey to italyat least three weeks before the date at which the new hotel was to open for the reception of travellers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the person answerable for this premature departure was francis westwick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> care should also be taken in withdrawing the dark slide in front of the plate from the holder as the same effect may be produced by a too hasty movement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lens is the last thing to be uncovered by withdrawing the cap c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which should not be done until you have placed the sitter in the most desirable position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when according to the judgment and experience of the operator the plate has remained long enough to receive a good inpression the cap is replaced over the lens and the dark slide over the plate which is then removed from the camera <end> <end> 
<start> <start> daguerreotypists generally mark time by their watches arriving at the nearest possible period for producing a good picture by making several trials <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a ready method of marking short intervals of time is however a very important consideration and as any instrument which will enable an artist to arrive at the exact period must be an improvement and worthy of universal adoption i will here describe one invented by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> constable sand clock or time keeper.it consists of a glass tube about twelve inches long by one in diameter half filled with fine sand similar to that used for the ordinary minute glasses and like them it has a diaphram with a small hole in the centre through which the sand runs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tube is attached to a board which revolves on a centre pin on the side is a graduated scale divided into half seconds the tube is also provided with a moveable index <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this instrument is attached in a conspicuous place to the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the glass tube being revolved on its centre the index is set to the number of half seconds required and the sand running down the required time is marked without the possibility of error <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in practice it will be found to be a far more convenient instrument for the purpose than either a clock or a seconds watch and is applicable both for the camera and mercury box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the artist finds it desirable or necessary to take the object to be copied in its right position that is reverse the image on the spectrum he can do so by attaching a mirror which may be had of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roach to the camera tube at an angle of fortyfive degrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if after taking the plate from the camera it be examined fourth process.bringing out the picture or rendering it visible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we now come to the use of the mercury bath fig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the bath a thermometer is attached to indicate the proper degree of beat required which should never be raised above deg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plate maybe put into one of the frames see fig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the mercury face downwards and examined from time to time by simply raising it with the fingers or a pair of plyers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this operation as well as the others should take place in the dark closet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple and prince certainpersonio had made a speech and everybody had cried hip hip hip hurrah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grandmarina announced to the king and queen that in future there would be eight quarterdays in every year except in leapyear when there would be ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then turned to certainpersonio and alicia and said my dears you will have thirtyfive children and they will all be good and beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seventeen of your children will be boys and eighteen will be girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will never have the measles and will have recovered from the on hearing such good news everybody cried out hip hip hip hurrah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it only remains said grandmarina in conclusion to make an end so she took it from the hand of the princess alicia and it instantly flew down the throat of the dreadful little snapping pug dog next door and choked him and he expired in convulsions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robin redforth the subject of our present narrative would appear to have devoted himself to the pirate profession at a comparatively early age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where have you heard him say these words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in flesh lane right opposite to the church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> telltrue give in your evidence concerning the prisoner at the bar about that for which he stands here as you see indicted by this honourable tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lord i have heard him often say he had rather think of the vilest thing than of what is contained in the holy scriptures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where did you hear him say such grievous words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a great many places particularly in nauseous street in the house of one shameless and in filth lane at the sign of the reprobate next door to the descent into the pit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gentlemen you have heard the indictment his plea and the testimony of the witnesses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hardheart thou art here indicted by the name of hardheart an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou didst most desperately and wickedly possess the town of mansoul with impenitency and obdurateness and didst keep them from remorse and sorrow for their evils all the time of their apostacy from and rebellion against the blessed king shaddai <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lord i never knew what remorse or sorrow meant in all my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i care for no man nor can i be pierced with mens griefs their groans will not enter into my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whomsoever i mischief whomsoever i wrong to me it is music when to others mourning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see the man is a right diabolonian and has convicted himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> falsepeace thou art here indicted by the name of falsepeace an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou didst most wickedly and satanically bring hold and keep the town of mansoul both in her apostacy and in her hellish rebellion in a false groundless and dangerous peace and damnable security to the dishonour of the king the transgression of his law and the great damage of the town of mansoul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> art thou guilty of this indictment or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> falsepeace gentlemen and you now appointed to be my judges i acknowledge that my name is mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peace but that my name is falsepeace i utterly deny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if your honours shall please to send for any that do intimately know me or for the midwife that laid my mother of me or for the gossips that were at my christening they will any or all of them prove that my name is not falsepeace but peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore i cannot plead to this indictment forasmuch as my name is not inserted therein and as is my true name so are also my conditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was always a man that loved to live at quiet and what i loved myself that i thought others might love also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore when i saw any of my neighbours to labour under a disquieted mind i endeavoured to help them what i could and instances of this good temper of mine many i could when at the beginning our town of mansoul did decline the ways of shaddai they some of them afterwards began to have disquieting reflections upon themselves for what they had done but i as one troubled to see them disquieted presently sought out means to get them quiet again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the ways of the old world and of sodom were in fashion if anything happened to molest those that were for the customs of the present times i laboured to make them quiet again and to cause them to act without molestation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to come nearer home when the wars fell out between shaddai and diabolus if at any time i saw any of the town of mansoul afraid of destruction i often used by some way device invention or other to labour to bring them to peace again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore since i have been always a man of so virtuous a temper as some say a peacemaker is and if a peacemaker be so deserving a man as some have been bold to attest he is then let me gentlemen be accounted by you who have a great name for justice and equity in mansoul for a man that deserveth not this inhuman way of treatment but liberty and also a license to seek damage of those that have crier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forasmuch as the prisoner at the bar hath denied his name to be that which is mentioned in the indictment the court requireth that if there be any in this place that can give information to the court of the original and right name of the prisoner they would come forth and give in their evidence for the prisoner stands upon his own innocency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came two into the court and desired that they might have leave to speak what they knew concerning the prisoner at the bar the name of the one was searchtruth and the name of the other vouchtruth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the court demanded of these men if they knew the prisoner and what they could say concerning court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lord i know and have known this man from a child and can attest that his name is falsepeace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know his father his name was mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flatter and his mother before she was married was called by the name of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soothup and these two when they came together lived not long without this son and when he was born they called his name false peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was his playfellow only i was somewhat older than he and when his mother did use to call him home from his play she used to say falsepeace falsepeace come home quick or ill fetch you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea i knew him when he sucked and though i was then but little yet i can remember that when his mother did use to sit at the door with him or did play with him in her arms she would call him twenty times together my little falsepeace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gossips also know it is thus though he has had the face to deny it in open court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vouchtruth was called upon to speak what he knew of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vouchtruth my lord all that the former witness hath said is true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his name is falsepeace the son of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soothup his mother and i have in former times seen him angry with those that have called him anything else but falsepeace for he would say that all such did mock and nickname him but this was in the time when mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> falsepeace was a great man and when the diabolonians were the brave men in mansoul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gentlemen you have heard what these two men have sworn against the prisoner at the bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> false peace to you you have denied your name to be falsepeace yet you see that these honest men have sworn that that is your name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to your plea in that you are quite besides the matter of your indictment you are not by it charged for evildoing because you are a man of peace or a peacemaker among your neighbours but for that you did wickedly and satanically bring keep and hold the town of mansoul both under its apostasy from and in its rebellion against its king in a false lying and damnable peace contrary to the law of shaddai and to the hazard of the destruction of the then miserable town of mansoul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that you have pleaded for yourself is that you have denied your name etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here you see we have witnesses to prove that you are the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the peace that you so much boast of making among your neighbours know that peace that is not a companion of truth and holiness but that which is without this foundation is grounded upon a lie and is both deceitful and damnable as also the great shaddai hath said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thy plea therefore has not delivered thee from what by the indictment thou art charged with but rather it doth fasten all upon thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us call the witnesses that are to testify as to matter of fact and see what they have to say for our lord the king against the prisoner at the bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knowall what say you for our lord the king against the prisoner at the bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lord this man hath of a long time made it to my knowledge his business to keep the town of mansoul in a sinful quietness in the midst of all her lewdness filthiness and turmoils and hath said and that in my hearing come come let us fly from all trouble on what ground soever it comes and let us be for a quiet and peaceable life though it wanteth a good foundation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the kings olaf and onund seeing they had for this time got all the victory that fate permitted them to gain let their ships retreat cast themselves loose from king canutes ship and the fleets separated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as the attack had not been made as king canute had determined he made no further attempt and the kings on each side arranged their fleets and put their ships in order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the fleets were parted and each sailing its course olaf and onund looked over their forces and found they had suffered no loss of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime they saw that if they waited until king canute got his large fleet in order to attack them the difference of force was so great that for them there was little chance of victory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was also evident that if the battle was renewed they must suffer a great loss of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they took the resolution therefore to row with the whole fleet eastward along the coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observing that king canute did not pursue them they raised up their masts and set sail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ottar svarte tells thus of the king in battle fray drove the swedish host away the wolf did not miss prey nor the raven on that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great canute might deride two kings if he had pride for at helga rivers side they would not his sword abide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thord sjarekson also sang these lines in his death song of king king olaf agders lord neer shunned the jutland king but with his blueedged sword broke many a panzer ring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king canute was not slow king onund filled the plain with dead killed by his bow the wolf howled oer the slain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king olaf and king onund sailed eastward to the swedish kings dominions and one day towards evening landed at a place called barvik where they lay all night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then it was observed of the swedes that they were homesick for the greater part of their forces sailed eastward along the land in the night and did not stop their course until they came home to their houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now when king onund observed this he ordered as soon as the day dawned to sound the signal for a housething and the whole people went on shore and the thing sat down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then king onund took up the word and spake thus so it is king olaf that as you know we have been assembled in summer and have forayed wide around in denmark and have gained much booty but no land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had vessels and now have not above remaining with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it appears to me we can make no greater progress than we have made although you have still the vessels which have followed you the whole summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it therefore appears to me best that we come back to my kingdom for it is always good to drive home with the wagon safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this expedition we have won something and lost nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i will offer you king olaf to come with me and we shall remain assembled during the winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take as much of my kingdom as you will so that you and the men who follow you may support yourselves well and when spring comes let us take such measures as we find serviceable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you however will prefer to travel across our country and go overland to norway it shall be free for you to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king olaf thanked king onund for his friendly offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if i may advise says he then we should take another resolution and keep together the forces we have still remaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had in the first of summer before i left norway ships but when i left the country i chose from among the whole warlevy those i thought to be the best and with them i manned ships and these i still have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it appears to me that the part of your warforce which has now run away is the most worthless and of least resistance but now i see here all your chiefs and leaders and i know well that the people who belong to the courttroops are by far the best suited to carry arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have here chosen men and superb ships and we can very well lie all winter in our ships as vikings custom is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but canute cannot lie long in helga river for the harbour will not hold so many vessels as he has <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he steers eastward after us we can escape from him and then people will soon gather to us but if he return to the harbours where his fleet can lie i know for certain that the desire to return home will not be less in his army than in ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think also we have ravaged so widely in summer that the villagers both in scania and in halland know well whose favour they have to seek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> canutes army will thus be dispersed so widely that it is uncertain to whom fate may at the last give the victory but let us first find out what resolution he takes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus king olaf ended his speech and it found much applause and his advice was followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> spies were sent into king canutes army and both the kings olaf and onund remained lying where they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> endnotes the thingmen or hired bodyguard attending the court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when king canute saw that the kings of norway and sweden steered eastward with their forces along the coast he sent men to ride night and day on the land to follow their movements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some spies went forward others returned so that king canute had news every day of their progress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had also spies always in their army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now when he heard that a great part of the fleet had sailed away from the kings he turned back with his forces to seeland and lay with his whole fleet in the sound so that a part lay on the scania side and a part on the seeland side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king canute himself the day before michaelmas rode with a great retinue to roeskilde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there his brotherinlaw earl ulf had prepared a great feast for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl was the most agreeable host but the king was silent and sullen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl talked to him in every way to make him cheerful and brought forward everything which he thought would amuse him but the king remained stern and speaking little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the earl proposed to him a game at chess which he agreed to and a chessboard was produced and they played together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> earl ulf was hasty in temper stiff and in nothing yielding but everything he managed went on well in his hands and he was a great warrior about whom there are many stories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the most powerful man in denmark next to the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> earl ulfs sister gyda was married to earl gudin godwin ulfnadson and their sons were harald king of england and earl toste earl valthiof earl morukare and earl svein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gyda was the name of their daughter who was married to the english king edward the good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they had played a while the king made a false move at which the earl took a knight from the king but the king set the piece again upon the board and told the earl to make another move but the earl grew angry threw over the chessboard stood up and went away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king said runnest thou away ulf the coward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl turned round at the door and said thou wouldst have run farther at helga river if thou hadst come to battle there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou didst not call me ulf the coward when i hastened to thy help while the swedes were beating thee like a dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl then went out and went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little later the king also went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following morning while the king was putting on his clothes he said to his footboy go thou to earl ulf and kill him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lad went was away a while and then came back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king said hast thou killed the earl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not kill him for he was gone to saint lucius church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a man called ivar white a norwegian by birth who was the kings courtman and chamberlain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king said to him go thou and kill the earl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ivar went to the church and in at the choir and thrust his sword through the earl who died on the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then ivar went to the king with the bloody sword in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king said hast thou killed the earl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the earl was killed the monks closed the church and locked the doors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when that was told the king he sent a message to the monks ordering them to open the church and sing high mass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did as the king ordered and when the king came to the church he bestowed on it great property so that it had a large domain by which that place was raised very high and these lands have since always belonged to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king canute rode down to his ships and lay there till late in harvest with a very large army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when king olaf and king onund heard that king canute had sailed to the sound and lay there with a great force the kings held a housething and spoke much about what resolution they should adopt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king olaf wished they should remain there with all the fleet and see what king canute would at last resolve to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the swedes held it to be unadvisable to remain until the frost set in and so it was determined and king onund went home with all his army and king olaf remained lying after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while king olaf lay there he had frequently conferences and consultations with his people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night egil halson and tofe valgautson had the watch upon the kings ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tofe came from west gautland and was a man of high birth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while they sat on watch they heard much lamentation and crying among the people who had been taken in the war and who lay bound on the shore at night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tofe said it made him ill to hear such distress and asked egil to go with him and let loose these people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this work they set about cut the cords and let the people escape and they looked upon it as a piece of great friendship but the king was so enraged at it that they themselves were in the greatest danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when egil afterwards fell sick the king for a long time would not visit him until many people entreated it of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it vexed egil much to have done anything the king was angry at and he begged his forgiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king now dismissed his wrath against egil laid his hands upon the side on which egils pain was and sang a prayer upon which the pain ceased instantly and egil grew better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tofe came after entreaty into reconciliation with the king on condition that he should exhort his father valgaut to come to the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a heathen but after conversation with the king he went over to christianity and died instantly when he was baptized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king olaf had now frequent conferences with his people and asked advice from them and from his chiefs as to what he should determine upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was no unanimity among them some considering that unadvisable which others considered highly serviceable and there was much indecision in their councils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king canute had always spies in king olafs army who entered into conversation with many of his men offering them presents and favour on account of king canute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many allowed themselves to be seduced and gave promises of fidelity and to be king canutes men and bring the country into his hands if he came to norway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was apparent afterwards of many who at first kept it concealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some took at once money bribes and others were promised money afterwards and a great many there were who had got great presents of money from him before for it may be said with truth of king canute that every man who came to him and who he thought had the spirit of a man and would like his favour got his hands full of gifts and money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this account he was very popular although his generosity was principally shown to foreigners and was greatest the greater distance they came from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king olaf had often conferences and meetings with his people and asked their counsel but as he observed they gave different opinions he had a suspicion that there must be some who spoke differently from what they really thought advisable for him and he was thus uncertain if all gave him due fidelity in council <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some pressed that with the first fair wind they should sail to the sound and so to norway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they said the danes would not dare to attack them although they lay with so great a force right in the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the king was a man of too much understanding not to see that this was impracticable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew also that olaf trygvason had found it quite otherwise as to the danes not daring to fight when he with a few people went into battle against a great body of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king also knew that in king canutes army there were a great many norwegians therefore he entertained the suspicion that those who gave this advice were more favourable to king canute than to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king olaf came at last to the determination from all these considerations that the people who would follow him should make themselves ready to proceed by land across gautland and so to norway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but our ships said he and all things that we cannot take with us i will send eastward to the swedish kings dominions and let them be taken care of for us there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harek of thjotta replied thus to the kings speech it is evident that i cannot travel on foot to norway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am old and heavy and little accustomed to walking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides i am unwilling to part with my ship for on that ship and its apparel i have bestowed so much labour that it would go much against my inclination to put her into the hands of my enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king said come along with us harek and we shall carry thee when i mount my ocean steed and oer the sea ill speed forests and hills are not for me i love the moving sea though canute block the sound rather than walk the ground and leave my ship ill see what my ship will do for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then king olaf let everything be put in order for the journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people had their walking clothing and weapons but their other clothes and effects they packed upon such horses as they could get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he sent off people to take his ships east to calmar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he had the vessels laid up and the ships apparel and other goods taken care of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harek did as he had said and waited for a wind and then sailed west to scania until about the decline of the day he came with a fresh and fair wind to the eastward of holar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he let the sail and the vane and flag and mast be taken down and let the upper works of the ship be covered over with some grey tiltcanvas and let a few men sit at the oars in the fore part and aft but the most were sitting low down in the vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when canutes watchmen saw the ship they talked with each other about what ship it might be and made the guess that it must be one loaded with herrings or salt as they only saw a few men at the oars and the ship besides appeared to them grey and wanting tar as if burnt up by the sun and they saw also that it was deeply loaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now when harek came farther through the sound and past the fleet he raised the mast hoisted sail and set up his gilded vane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sail was white as snow and in it were red and blue stripes of cloth interwoven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the kings men saw the ship sailing in this state they told the king that probably king olaf had sailed through them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but king canute replies that king olaf was too prudent a man to sail with a single ship through king canutes fleet and thought it more likely to be harek of thjotta or the like of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many believed the truth to be that king canute knew of this expedition of harek and that it would not have succeeded so if they had not concluded a friendship beforehand with each other which seemed likely after king canutes and hareks friendly understanding became generally known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harek made this song as he sailed northward round the isle of the widows of lund may smile through their tears the danish girls may have their jeers they may laugh or smile but outside their isle old harek still on to his north land steers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harek went on his way and never stopped till he came north to halogaland to his own house in thjotta <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when king olaf began his journey he came first into smaland and then into west gautland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he marched quietly and peaceably and the country people gave him all assistance on his journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus he proceeded until he came into viken and north through viken to sarpsborg where he remained and ordered a winter abode to be prepared ad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he gave most of the chiefs leave to return home but kept the lendermen by him whom he thought the most serviceable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were with him also all the sons of arne arnmodson and they stood in great favour with the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> geller thorkelson who the summer before had come from iceland also came there to the king as before related <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sigvat the skald had long been in king olafs household as before related and the king made him his marshal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sigvat had no talent for speaking in prose but in skaldcraft he was so practised that the verses came as readily from his tongue as if he were speaking in usual language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had made a mercantile journey to normandy and in the course of it had come to england where he met king canute and obtained permission from him to sail to norway as before related <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he came to norway he proceeded straight to king olaf and found him at sarpsborg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he presented himself before the king just as he was sitting down to table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king looked at sigvat and was great king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thy marshal is come home no more by land or sea to roam but by thy side still to abide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what seat here shall be take for the kings honour not his sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all seats here to me are dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then was verified the old saying that many are the ears of a king for king olaf had heard all about sigvats journey and that he had spoken with canute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says to sigvat i do not know if thou art my marshal or hast become one of canutes men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> canute whose golden gifts display a generous heart would have me stay service in his great court to take and my own norway king forsake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two masters at a time i said were one too many for men bred where truth and virtue shown to all make all men true in olafs hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then king olaf told sigvat to take his seat where he before used to sit and in a short time sigvat was in as high favour with the king as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> erling skjalgson and all his sons had been all summer in king canutes army in the retinue of earl hakon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorer hund was also there and was in high esteem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now when king canute heard that king olaf had gone overland to norway he discharged his army and gave all men leave to go to their winter abodes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was then in denmark a great army of foreigners both english norwegians and men of other countries who had joined the expedition in summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> erling skjalgson went to norway with his men and received great presents from king canute at parting but thorer hund remained behind in king canutes court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with erling went messengers from king canute well provided with money and in winter they travelled through all the country paying the money which king canute had promised to many in autumn for their assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gave presents in money besides to many whose friendship could be purchased for king canute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they received much assistance in their travels from erling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this way it came to pass that many turned their support to king canute promised him their services and agreed to oppose king olaf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some did this openly but many more concealed it from the public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king olaf heard this news for many had something to tell him about it and the conversation in the court often turned upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sigvat the skald made a song the base traitors ply with purses of gold wanting to buy what is not to be sold the kings life and throne wanting to buy but our souls are our own and to hell well not hie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no pleasure in heaven as we know full well to the traitor is given his soul is his hell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often also the conversation turned upon how ill it beseemed earl hakon to raise his hand in arms against king olaf who had given him his life when he fell into the kings power but sigvat was a particular friend of earl hakon and when he heard the earl our own court people we may blame if they take gold to their own shame their king and country to betray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with those who give its not the same from them we have no faith to claim tis we are wrong if we give way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> king olaf gave a great feast at yule and many great people had come to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the seventh day of yule that the king with a few persons among whom was sigvat who attended him day and night went to a house in which the kings most precious valuables were kept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had according to his custom collected there with great care the valuable presents he was to make on new years eve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was in the house no small number of gold the swords stand there all bright and fair those oars that dip in blood if i in favour stood i too might have a share <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sword the skald would gladly take and use it for his masters sake in favour once he stood and a sword has stained in blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king took a sword of which the handle was twisted round with gold and the guard was goldmounted and gave it to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a valuable article but the gift was not seen without envy as will appear hereafter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately after yule the king began his journey to the uplands for he had a great many people about him but had received no income that autumn from the north country for there had been an armament in summer and the king had laid out all the revenues he could command and also he had no vessels with which he and his people could go to the north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time he had news from the north from which he could see that there would be no safety for him in that quarter unless he went with a great force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for these reasons he determined to proceed through the uplands although it was not so long a time since he had been there in guestquarters as the law prescribes and as the kings usually had the custom of observing in their visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he came to the uplands the lendermen and the richest bondes invited him to be their guest and thus lightened his expenses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a man called bjorn who was of gautland family and a friend and acquaintance of queen astrid and in some way related to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had given him farmmanagement and other offices in the upper part of hedemark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had also the management of osterdal district <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bjorn was not in esteem with the king nor liked by the bondes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened in a hamlet which bjorn ruled over that many swine and cattle were missing therefore bjorn ordered a thing to be called to examine the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such pillage he attributed chiefly to the people settled in forestfarms far from other men by which he referred particularly to those who dwelt in osterdal for that district was very thinly inhabited and full of lakes and forestcleanings and but in few places was any great neighbourhood together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a man called raud who dwelt in osterdal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife was called ragnhild and his sons dag and sigurd were men of great talent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were present at the thing made a reply in defence of the osterdal people and removed the accusation from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bjorn thought they were too pert in their answer and too fine in their clothes and weapons and therefore turned his speech against these brothers and said it was not unlikely they may have committed these thefts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon after king olaf with his retinue came to guest quarters in the house of bailiff bjorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the matter which had been before the thing was then complained of to the king and bjorn said that rauds sons appeared to him to have committed these thefts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a messenger was sent for rauds sons and when they appeared before the king he said they had not at all the appearance of thieves and acquitted them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon they invited the king with all his retinue to a three days entertainment at their fathers and although bjorn dissuaded him from it the king went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at rauds there was a very excellent feast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king asked raud what people he and his wife were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raud answered that he was originally a swedish man rich and of high birth but i ran away with the wife i have ever since had and she is a sister of king hring dagson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found that father and sons were men of understanding and asked them what they could do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sigurd said he could interpret dreams and determine the time of the day although no heavenly bodies could be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king made trial of his art and found it was as sigurd had said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dag stated as his accomplishment that he could see the misdeeds and vices of every man who came under his eye when he chose to observe him closely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king told him to declare what faults of disposition he saw in the king himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dag mentioned a fault which the king was sensible he really had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the king asked what fault the bailiff bjorn had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dag said bjorn was a thief and told also where bjorn had concealed on his farm the bones horns and hides of the cattle he had stolen in autumn for he committed said dag all the thefts in autumn which he accuses other people of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dag also told the king the places where the king should go after leaving them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the king departed from rauds house he was accompanied on the way and presented with friendly gifts and rauds sons remained with the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king went first to bjorns and found there that all dag had told him was true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon which he drove bjorn out of the country and he had to thank the queen that he preserved life and limbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorer a son of olver of eggja a stepson of kalf arnason and a sisters son of thorer hund was a remarkably handsome man stout and strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was at this time eighteen years old had made a good marriage in hedemark by which he got great wealth and was besides one of the most popular of men and formed to be a chief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he invited the king and his retinue home to him to a feast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king accepted the invitation went to thorers and was well received <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the entertainment was very splendid they were excellently treated and all that was set before the guests was of the best that could be got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king and his people talked among themselves of the excellence of everything and knew not what they should admire the most whether thorers house outside or the inside furniture the table service or the liquors or the host who gave them such a feast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king used often to speak to dag and ask him about various things and he had proved the truth of all that dag had said both of things that had happened or were to happen and therefore the king had much confidence in what he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king called dag to him to have a private conversation together and spoke to him about many things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwards the king turned the conversation on thorer what an excellent man thorer was and what a superb feast he had made for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dag answered but little to this but agreed it was true what the king said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king then asked dag what disposition or faith he found in thorer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dag replied that he must certainly consider thorer of a good disposition if he be really what most people believe him to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king told him to answer direct what he was asked and said that it was his duty to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dag replies then thou must allow me to determine the punishment if i disclose his faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king replied that he would not submit his decision to another man but again ordered dag to reply to what he asked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dag replies the sovereigns order goes before all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i find this disposition in thorer as in so many others that he is too greedy of money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king is he then a thief or a robber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to win money he is a traitor to his sovereign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has taken money from king canute the great for thy head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king asks what proof hast thou of the truth of this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dag he has upon his right arm above the elbow a thick gold ring which king canute gave him and which he lets no man see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this ended their conference and the king was very wroth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now as the king sat at table and the guests had drunk a while with great mirth and thorer went round to see the guests well served the king ordered thorer to be called to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went up before the table and laid his hands upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king asked how old a man art thou thorer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stout man thou art for those years and thou hast been fortunate also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the king took his right hand and felt it towards the elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorer said take care for i have a boil upon my arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king held his hand there and felt there was something hard under it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hast thou not heard said he that i am a physician <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as thorer saw it was of no use to conceal it longer he took off the ring and laid it on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king asked if that was the gift of king canute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was drawn by a very quiet but very keenlooking man with irongray hair who was slightly lame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had passed us when the carriage stopped and the old gentleman within putting out his arm called to me by my name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went back and was absent from mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slinkton and his niece for about five minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed it is well you have not been longer or my niece might have died an old east india director said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an intimate friend of our friends at whose house i first had the pleasure of meeting you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very rich miss niner but very old and very crippled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an amiable man sensible much interested in you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he of all the visitors who could come here he said in a hoarse alarmed voice turning to his companion this is the one i should desire most to avoid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the student opened a frail door in the wall communicating where the garretroof began to slope towards the floor with a small the student then resumed his place upon the couch and called to dear mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edmund said milly looking round they told me there was a gentleman here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put her little basket on the table and went up to the back of the couch as if to take the extended hand but it was not there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little surprised in her quiet way she leaned over to look at are you quite as well tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your head is not so cool as in the afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the student petulantly very little ails me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little more surprise but no reproach was expressed in her face as she withdrew to the other side of the table and took a small packet of needlework from her basket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she laid it down again on second thoughts and going noiselessly about the room set everything exactly in its place and in the neatest order even to the cushions on the couch which she touched with so light a hand that he hardly seemed to know it as he lay looking at the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when all this was done and she had swept the hearth she sat down in her modest little bonnet to her work and was quietly busy on its the new muslin curtain for the window mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edmund said milly stitching away as she talked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will look very clean and nice though it costs very little and will save your eyes too from the light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my william says the room should not be too light just now when you are recovering so well or the glare might make you giddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said nothing but there was something so fretful and impatient in his change of position that her quick fingers stopped and she the pillows are not comfortable she said laying down her work and rising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raised his head to say this and looked at her so thanklessly that after he had thrown himself down again she stood timidly pausing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however she resumed her seat and her needle without having directed even a murmuring look towards him and was soon as i have been thinking mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edmund that you have been often thinking of late when i have been sitting by how true the saying is that adversity is a good teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> health will be more precious to you after this illness than it has ever been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he does not paw and prance and arch his neck and bid the world admire his beauties but like his master he is useful and when he is wanted he can always do his work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o fortunatus nimium agricola who has one horse and that a good one in the middle of a hunting country the man who hunts and never jumps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the british public who do not hunt believe too much in the jumping of those who do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is thought by many among the laity that the hunting man is always in the air making clear flights over fivebarred gates sixfoot walls and double posts and rails at none of which would the average hunting man any more think of riding than he would at a small house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we used to hear much of the galway blazers and it was supposed that in county galway a stiffbuilt wall six feet high was the sort of thing that you customarily met from field to field when hunting in that comfortable county <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such little impediments were the ordinary food of a real blazer who was supposed to add another foot of stonework and a sod of turf when desirous of making himself conspicuous in his moments of splendid ambition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twenty years ago i rode in galway now and then and i found the sixfoot walls all shorn of their glory and that men whose necks were of any value were very anxious to have some preliminary knowledge of the nature of the fabric whether for instance it might be solid or built of loose stones before they trusted themselves to an encounter with a wall of four feet and a half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here in england history that nursing mother of fiction has given hunting men honours which they here never fairly earned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once upon a time said the linnet there was an honest little fellow named hans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no answered the linnet i dont think he was distinguished at all except for his kind heart and his funny round goodhumoured face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lived in a tiny cottage all by himself and every day he worked in his garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all the countryside there was no garden so lovely as his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sweetwilliam grew there and gillyflowers and shepherdspurses and fairmaids of france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were damask roses and yellow roses lilac crocuses and gold purple violets and white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> columbine and ladysmock marjoram and wild basil the cowslip and the flowerdeluce the daffodil and the clovepink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by one flower taking another flowers place so that there were always beautiful things to look at and pleasant odours to smell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little hans had a great many friends but the most devoted friend of all was big hugh the miller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed so devoted was the rich miller to little hans that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay or a handful of sweet herbs or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> real friends should have everything in common the miller used to say and little hans nodded and smiled and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was strangely pale but his lips were like a proud red flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed weary and was leaning back toying in a listless manner with the pommel of his dagger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the grass beside him lay a plumed hat and a pair of ridinggloves gauntleted with gilt lace and sewn with seedpearls wrought into a curious device <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a short cloak lined with sables hang from his shoulder and his delicate white hands were gemmed with rings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young fisherman watched him as one snared in a spell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last their eyes met and wherever he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the man were upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard the witch laugh and caught her by the waist and whirled her madly round and round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly a dog bayed in the wood and the dancers stopped and going up two by two knelt down and kissed the mans hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they did so a little smile touched his proud lips as a birds wing touches the water and makes it laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us worship whispered the witch and she led him up and a great desire to do as she besought him seized on him and he followed her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when he came close and without knowing why he did it he made on his breast the sign of the cross and called upon the holy name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew away and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a spasm of pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man went over to a little wood and whistled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a jennet with silver trappings came running to meet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he leapt upon the saddle he turned round and looked at the young fisherman sadly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the witch with the red hair tried to fly away also but the fisherman caught her by her wrists and held her fast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loose me she cried and let me go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for thou hast named what nay he answered but i will not let thee go till thou hast told what secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the witch wrestling with him like a wild cat and biting her foamflecked lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her grassgreen eyes grew dim with tears and she said to the he laughed and held her all the more tightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she saw that she could not free herself she whispered to him surely i am as fair as the daughters of the sea and as comely as those that dwell in the blue waters and she fawned on him and put her face close to his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he thrust her back frowning and said to her if thou keepest not the promise that thou madest to me i will slay thee for a false she grew grey as a blossom of the judas tree and shuddered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she took from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green vipers skin and gave it to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a miserable dogs life he lived with old matt abrahamson for the old fisherman was in his cups more than half the time and when he was so there was hardly a day passed that he did not give tom a curse or a buffet or as like as not an actual beating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one would have thought that such treatment would have broken the spirit of the poor little foundling but it had just the opposite effect upon tom chist who was one of your stubborn sturdy stiffwilled fellows who only grow harder and more tough the more they are illtreated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been a long time now since he had made any outcry or complaint at the hard usage he suffered from old matt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at such times he would shut his teeth and bear whatever came to him until sometimes the halfdrunken old man would be driven almost mad by his stubborn silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe he would stop in the midst of the beating he was administering and grinding his teeth would cry out wont ye say naught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then ill see if i cant make ye say naught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when things had reached such a pass as this molly would generally interfere to protect her foster son and then she and tom would together fight the old man until they had wrenched the stick or the strap out of his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then old matt would chase them out of doors and around and around the house for maybe half an hour until his anger was cool when he would go back again and for a time the storm would be over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides his foster mother tom chist had a very good friend in parson jones who used to come over every now and then to abrahamsons hut upon the chance of getting a half dozen fish for breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he always had a kind word or two for tom who during the winter evenings would go over to the good mans house to learn his letters and to read and write and cipher a little so that by now he was able to spell the words out of the bible and the almanac and knew enough to change tuppence into four hapennies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the sort of boy tom chist was and this is the sort of life he led <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the late spring or early summer of captain kidds sloop sailed into the mouth of the delaware bay and changed the whole fortune of his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this is how you come to the story of captain kidds treasure box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old matt abrahamson kept the flatbottomed boat in which he went fishing some distance down the shore and in the neighborhood of the old wreck that had been sunk on the shoals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the usual fishing ground of the settlers and here old matts boat generally lay drawn up on the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had been a thunderstorm that afternoon and tom had gone down the beach to bale out the boat in readiness for the mornings fishing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was full moonlight now as he was returning and the night sky was full of floating clouds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then there was a dull flash to the westward and once a muttering growl of thunder promising another storm to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that day the pirate sloop had been lying just off the shore back of the capes and now tom chist could see the sails glimmering pallidly in the moonlight spread for drying after the storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was walking up the shore homeward when he became aware that at some distance ahead of him there was a ships boat drawn up on the little narrow beach and a group of men clustered about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hurried forward with a good deal of curiosity to see who had landed but it was not until he had come close to them that he could distinguish who and what they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he knew that it must be a party who had come off the pirate sloop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had evidently just landed and two men were lifting out a chest from the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them was a negro naked to the waist and the other was a white man in his shirt sleeves wearing petticoat breeches a monterey cap upon his head a red bandanna handkerchief around his neck and gold earrings in his ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a long plaited queue hanging down his back and a great sheath knife dangling from his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another man evidently the captain of the party stood at a little distance as they lifted the chest out of the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a cane in one hand and a lighted lantern in the other although the moon was shining as bright as day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore jack boots and a handsome laced coat and he had a long drooping mustache that curled down below his chin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore a fine feathered hat and his long black hair hung down upon his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this tom chist could see in the moonlight that glinted and twinkled upon the gilt buttons of his coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were so busy lifting the chest from the boat that at first they did not observe that tom chist had come up and was standing there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the white man with the long plaited queue and the gold earrings that spoke to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then dropping his end of the chest and without giving tom time to answer he pointed off down the beach and said youd better be going about your own business if you know whats good for you and dont you come back or youll find what you dont want waiting for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom saw in a glance that the pirates were all looking at him and then without saying a word he turned and walked away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man who had spoken to him followed him threateningly for some little distance as though to see that he had gone away as he was bidden to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but presently he stopped and tom hurried on alone until the boat and the crew and all were dropped away behind and lost in the moonlight night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he himself stopped also turned and looked back whence he had come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had been something very strange in the appearance of the men he had just seen something very mysterious in their actions and he wondered what it all meant and what they were going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood for a little while thus looking and listening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could see nothing and could hear only the sound of distant talking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what were they doing on the lonely shore thus at night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then following a sudden impulse he turned and cut off across the sand hummocks skirting around inland but keeping pretty close to the shore his object being to spy upon them and to watch what they were about from the back of the low sand hills that fronted the beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had gone along some distance in his circuitous return when he became aware of the sound of voices that seemed to be drawing closer to him as he came toward the speakers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped and stood listening and instantly as he stopped the voices stopped also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he crouched there silently in the bright glimmering moonlight surrounded by the silent stretches of sand and the stillness seemed to press upon him like a heavy hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly the sound of a mans voice began again and as tom listened he could hear some one slowly counting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ninetyone the voice began ninetytwo ninetythree ninetyfour ninetyfive ninety six ninetyseven ninetyeight ninetynine one hundred one hundred and onethe slow monotonous count coming nearer and nearer one hundred and two one hundred and three one hundred and four and so on in its monotonous reckoning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he saw three heads appear above the sand hill so close to him that he crouched down quickly with a keen thrill close beside the hummock near which he stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his first fear was that they might have seen him in the moonlight but they had not and his heart rose again as the counting voice went steadily on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> utterson the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering and the cook crying out bless god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> utterson ran forward as if to take him in her arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very irregular very unseemly your master would be far from pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blank silence followed no one protesting only the maid lifted up her voice and now wept loudly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poole said to her with a ferocity of accent that testified to his own jangled nerves and indeed when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation they had all started and turned toward the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now continued the butler addressing the knifeboy reach me a candle and well get this through hands at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> utterson to follow him and led the way to the backgarden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now sir said he you come as gently as you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to hear and i dont want you to be heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and see here sir if by any chance he was to ask you in dont go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> uttersons nerves at this unlookedfor termination gave a jerk that nearly threw him from his balance but he recollected and followed the butler into the laboratory building and through the surgical theatre with its lumber of crates and bottles to the foot of the stair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen while he himself setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> utterson sir asking to see you he called and even as he did so once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a voice answered from within tell him i cannot see any one it said complainingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you sir said poole with a note of something like triumph in his voice and taking up his candle he led mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> utterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> utterson in the eyes was that my masters voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind made talking difficult and flecked the blood into the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers besides for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> utterson thought he had never seen that part of london so deserted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could have wished it otherwise never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellowcreatures for struggle as he might there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the square when they got there was full of wind and dust and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poole who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead now pulled up in the middle of the pavement and in spite of the biting weather took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pockethandkerchief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for all the hurry of his coming these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away but the moisture of some strangling anguish for his face was white and his voice when he spoke harsh and broken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir he said here we are and god grant there be nothing wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner the door was opened on the chain and a voice asked from within is that you poole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hall when they entered it was brightly lighted up the fire was built high and about the hearth the whole of the servants men and women stood huddled together like a flock of sheep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> utterson the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering and the cook crying out bless god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> utterson ran forward as if to take him in her arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very irregular very unseemly your master would be far from pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blank silence followed no one protesting only the maid lifted her voice and now wept loudly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phil was blissfully content with the little one over the kitchen and aunt jamesina was to have the downstairs one off the livingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne walking home from redmond a few days after her return became aware that the people that she met surveyed her with a covert indulgent smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne wondered uneasily what was the matter with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> craning her head to investigate anne for the first time saw rusty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trotting along behind her close to her heels was quite the most forlorn specimen of the cat tribe she had ever beheld <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the animal was well past kittenhood lank thin disreputable looking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pieces of both ears were lacking one eye was temporarily out of repair and one jowl ludicrously swollen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for color if a once black cat had been well and thoroughly singed the result would have resembled the hue of this waifs thin draggled unsightly fur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne shooed but the cat would not shoo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as she stood he sat back on his haunches and gazed at her reproachfully out of his one good eye when she resumed her walk he followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne resigned herself to his company until she reached the gate of pattys place which she coldly shut in his face fondly supposing she had seen the last of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when fifteen minutes later phil opened the door there sat the rustybrown cat on the step <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more he promptly darted in and sprang upon annes lap with a halfpleading halftriumphant miaow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne said stella severely do you own that animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like decent cats reasonably well but i dont like beasties of your complexion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he coolly curled up in annes lap and began to purr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor creature is starving said phil pityingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why his bones are almost coming through his skin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill give him a square meal and then he must return to whence he came said anne resolutely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning he was still on the doorstep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the doorstep he continued to sit bolting in whenever the door was opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no coolness of welcome had the least effect on him of nobody save anne did he take the least notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of compassion the girls fed him but when a week had passed they decided that something must be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eye and cheek had resumed their normal appearance he was not quite so thin and he had been seen washing his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for all that we cant keep him said stella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aunt jimsie is coming next week and she will bring the sarahcat with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant keep two cats and if we did this rusty coat would fight all the time with the sarahcat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a pitched battle last evening with the tobaccokings cat and routed him horse foot and artillery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must get rid of him agreed anne looking darkly at the subject of their discussion who was purring on the hearth rug with an air of lamblike meekness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can four unprotected females get rid of a cat who wont be got rid of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who of us knows anything about chloroforming a cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its one of my few sadly few useful accomplishments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you take the cat in the morning and give him a good breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you take an old burlap bag theres one in the back porch put the cat on it and turn over him a wooden box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then take a twoounce bottle of chloroform uncork it and slip it under the edge of the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put a heavy weight on top of the box and leave it till evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cat will be dead curled up peacefully as if he were asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> accordingly the chloroform was procured and the next morning rusty was lured to his doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ate his breakfast licked his chops and climbed into annes lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could she be a party to this destruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here take him she said hastily to phil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wont suffer you know comforted phil but anne had fled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fatal deed was done in the back porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at dusk phil declared that rusty must be buried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pris and stella must dig his grave in the orchard declared phil and anne must come with me to lift the box off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two conspirators tiptoed reluctantly to the back porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phil gingerly lifted the stone she had put on the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly faint but distinct sounded an unmistakable mew under the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he he isnt dead gasped anne sitting blankly down on the kitchen doorstep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no the voices of the dead sound like the distant torrents fall promptly counterquoted anne pointing solemnly to the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must leave him here till morning said phil replacing the stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps the mews we heard were his dying groan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or perhaps we merely imagined them under the strain of our guilty consciences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when the box was lifted in the morning rusty bounded at one gay leap to annes shoulder where he began to lick her face affectionately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never was there a cat more decidedly alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres a knot hole in the box groaned phil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now weve got to do it all over again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes my cat and youve just got to make the best of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well if youll settle with aunt jimsie and the sarahcat said stella with the air of one washing her hands of the whole affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that time rusty was one of the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slept onights on the scrubbing cushion in the back porch and lived on the fat of the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time aunt jamesina came he was plump and glossy and tolerably respectable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but like kiplings cat he walked by himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his paw was against every cat and every cats paw against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one by one he vanquished the aristocratic felines of spofford avenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for human beings he loved anne and anne alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an angry spit and something that sounded much like very improper language greeted any one who did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the airs that cat puts on are perfectly intolerable declared stella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> him was a nice old pussens him was vowed anne cuddling her pet defiantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont know how he and the sarahcat will ever make out to live together said stella pesimistically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> catfights in the orchard onights are bad enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but catfights here in the livingroom are unthinkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne and priscilla and phil had awaited her advent rather dubiously but when aunt jamesina was enthroned in the rocking chair before the open fire they figuratively bowed down and worshipped her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hooted in a joyous chorus at the close of each refrain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed finally the master of cere monies for the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is zuyamanis story of his great ride that we should now hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not far from this place upon the missouri river and within the recollection of many of us that this occurred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was the ready response of all pres ent and the drum was struck once according to custom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pipe was filled and handed to zuy amani who gravely smoked for a few moments in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he related his contribution to the unwritten history of our frontier in these it was during the winter following that sum mer in which general sibley pursued many of our people across the muddy river that we hunkpatees friendly sioux were camping at a place called huntthedeer about two miles from fort rice dakota territory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chief soldier of the garrison called one day upon the leading chiefs of our band <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to each one he said lend me your bravest war rior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each chief called his principal warriors together and laid the matter before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chief soldier at this place they ex plained wants to send a message to fort ber thold where the rees and mandans live to an other chief soldier there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the soldiers of the great father do not know the way neither could any of them get through the lines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asks for the mandans and the rees were our hered itary enemies but this was not the principal rea son for our hesitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had declared alle giance to the great father at washington we had taken our stand against the fighting men of our own nation and the hostile sioux were worse than enemies to us at this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each chief had only called on his leading warriors and each in turn reported his failure to secure a volunteer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the chief soldier sent again and said is there not a young man among you who dares to face death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he reaches the fort with my message he will need to be quickwitted as well as brave and the great father will not forget now all the chiefs together called all the young men in a great council and submitted to them the demand of the great fathers servant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we knew well that the country between us and fort berthold about one hundred and fifty miles distant was alive with hostile sioux and that if any of us should be caught and recognized by them he would surely be put to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would not be easy to deceive them by professing hostil ity to the government for the record of each individual indian is well known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the warriors were still unwilling to go for they argued thus this is a white mans errand and will not be recorded as a brave deed upon the honor roll of our people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think many would have vol unteered but for that belief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that time we had not a high opinion of the white man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since all the rest were silent it came into my mind to offer my services <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the warriors looked at me in astonishment for i was a very young man and had no experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our chief two bears who was my own uncle finally presented my name to the command ing officer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he praised my courage and begged me to be vigilant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the interpreter told him that i had never been upon the warpath and would be knocked over like a rabbit but as no one else would go he was obliged to accept me as his messenger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave me a fine horse and saddle also a rifle and soldiers uniform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would not take the gun nor wear the blue coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i accepted only a revolver and i took my bow and quiver full of arrows and wore my usual dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i set out before daybreak the next morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rode up the river on the west bank keeping a very close watch all the way but seeing nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been provided with a pair of field glasses and i surveyed the country on all sides from the top of every hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having traveled all day and part of the night i rested my horse and i took a little sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after eating a small quantity of pemmican i made a very early start in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was scarcely light when i headed for a nearby ridge from which to survey the country beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as i ascended the rise i found myself almost sur rounded by loose ponies evidently belonging to a winter camp of the hostile sioux <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i readjusted my saddle tightened the girths and prepared to ride swiftly around the camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw some men already out after ponies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one appeared to have seen me as yet but i felt that as soon as it became lighter they could not help observing me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned to make the circuit of the camp which was a very large one and as soon as i reached the timbered bottom lands i began to congratulate myself that i had not been seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i entered the woods at the crossing of a dry creek i noticed that my horse was nervous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that horses are quick to discover animals or men by scent and i became nervous too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the animal put his four feet together and almost slid down the steep bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he came out on the opposite side he swerved suddenly and started to run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed a reflection on me that i was not ambitious enough to have found all such matters out before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am surprised my boy that you should fail to recognize this feather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a cree medicine feather and not a warriors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i said with much embarrassment you had better tell me again uncle the lan guage of the feathers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day was now gone the moon had risen but the cold had not lessened for the trunks of the trees were still snapping all around our tee pee which was lighted and warmed by the im mense logs which uncheedahs industry had pro vided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncle white footprint now under took to explain to me the significance of the eagles feather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eagle is the most warlike bird he be gan and the most kingly of all birds besides his feathers are unlike any others and these are the reasons why they are used by our people to signify deeds of bravery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not true that when a man wears a feather bonnet each one of the feathers represents the kill ing of a foe or even a coup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a man wears an eagle feather upright upon his head he is sup posed to have counted one of four coups upon his enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then a coup does not mean the killing of an enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no it is the afterstroke or touching of the body after he falls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is so ordered because often times the touching of an enemy is much more dif ficult to accomplish than the shooting of one from a distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it requires a strong heart to face the whole body of the enemy in order to count the coup on the fallen one who lies under cover of his kinsmens fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many a brave man has been lost in the attempt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a warrior approaches his foe dead or alive he calls upon the other warriors to wit ness by saying i fearless bear your brave again perform the brave deed of counting the first or second or third or fourth coup upon the body of the bravest of your enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally those who are present will see the act and be able to testify to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they return the heralds as you know announce publicly all such deeds of valor which then become a part of the mans war record <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any brave who would wear the eagles feather must give proof of his right to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a brave is wounded in the same battle where he counted his coup he wears the feather hanging downward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he is wounded but makes no count he trims his feather and in that case it need not be an eagle feather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a warrior wears a feather with a round mark it means that he slew his enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the mark is cut into the feather and painted red it means that he took the scalp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a brave who has been successful in ten bat tles is entitled to a warbonnet and if he is a rec ognized leader he is permitted to wear one with long trailing plumes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also those who have counted many coups may tip the ends of the feath ers with bits of white or colored down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some times the eagle feather is tipped with a strip of weasel skin that means the wearer had the honor of killing scalping and counting the first coup upon the enemy all at the same time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this feather you have found was worn by a creeit is indiscriminately painted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all other feathers worn by the common indians mean noth ing he added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me uncle whether it would be proper for me to wear any feathers at all if i have never gone upon the warpath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you could wear any other kind of feathers but not an eagles replied my uncle although sometimes one is worn on great occasions by the child of a noted man to indicate the fathers dig nity and position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fire had gone down somewhat so i pushed the embers together and wrapped my robe more closely about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then the ice on the lake would burst with a loud report like thunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> uncheedah was busy restringing one of uncles old snowshoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were two different kinds that he wore one with a straight toe and long the other shorter and with an upturned toe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had one of the shoes fastened toe down between sticks driven into the ground while she put in some new strings and tightened the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aunt four stars was beading a new pair of moccasins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wabeda the dog the companion of my boy hood days was in trouble because he insisted upon bringing his extra bone into the teepee while uncheedah was determined that he should not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sympathized with him because i saw the matter as he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he should bury it in the snow out side i knew shunktokecha the coyote would surely steal it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew just how anxious wabeda was about his bone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a fat bonei mean a bone of a fat deer and all indians know how much better they are than the other kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wabeda always hated to see a good thing go to waste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes spoke words to me for he and i had been friends for a long time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i was afraid of anything in the woods he would get in front of me at once and gently wag his tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he always made it a point to look directly in my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his kind large eyes gave me a thousand assur ances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i was perplexed he would hang about me until he understood the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many times i believed he saved my life by utter ing the dog word in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most animals even the dangerous grizzly do not care to be seen when the twolegged kind and his dog are about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i feared a surprise by a bear or a grey wolf i would say to wabeda now my dog give your warwhoop and immediately he would sit up on his haunches and bark to beat the band as you white boys say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his bitter and at the same time wellgrounded and philosophical dislike of the conquering race is well expressed in a speech made before the purely indian council before referred to upon the powder river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will give it in brief as it has been several times repeated to me by men who were present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behold my friends the spring is come the earth has gladly received the embraces of the sun and we shall soon see the results of their love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every seed is awakened and all animal life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is through this mysterious power that we too have our being and we therefore yield to our neighbors even to our animal neighbors the same right as ourselves to inhabit this vast land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have now to deal with another people small and feeble when our forefathers first met with them but now great and overbearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strangely enough they have a mind to till the soil and the love of possessions is a disease in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these people have made many rules that the rich may break but the poor may not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have a religion in which the poor worship but the rich will not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they even take tithes of the poor and weak to support the rich and those who rule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they claim this mother of ours the earth for their own use and fence their neighbors away from her and deface her with their buildings and their refuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they compel her to produce out of season and when sterile she is made to take medicine in order to produce again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this nation is like a spring freshet it overruns its banks and destroys all who are in its path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only seven years ago we made a treaty by which we were assured that the buffalo country should be left to us forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now they threaten to take that from us also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or shall we say to them first kill me before you can take possession of my fatherland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as sitting bull spoke so he felt and he had the courage to stand by his words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crazy horse led his forces in the field as for him he applied his energies to state affairs and by his strong and aggressive personality contributed much to holding the hostiles together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be said without fear of contradiction that sitting bull never killed any women or children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a fair fighter and while not prominent in battle after his young manhood he was the brains of the sioux resistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has been called a medicine man and a dreamer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strictly speaking he was neither of these and the white historians are prone to confuse the two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a medicine man is a doctor or healer a dreamer is an active war prophet who leads his war party according to his dream or prophecy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is called by whites making medicine in war time is again a wrong conception <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every warrior carries a bag of sacred or lucky charms supposed to protect the wearer alone but it has nothing to do with the success or safety of the party as a whole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one can make any medicine to affect the result of a battle although it has been said that sitting bull did this at the battle of the little big horn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when custer and reno attacked the camp at both ends the chief was caught napping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the village was in danger of surprise and the women and children must be placed in safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like other men of his age sitting bull got his family together for flight and then joined the warriors on the reno side of the attack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus he was not in the famous charge against custer nevertheless his voice was heard exhorting the warriors throughout that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the autumn of after the fall of custer sitting bull was hunted all through the yellowstone region by the military <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following characteristic letter doubtless written at his dictation by a halfbreed interpreter was sent to colonel otis immediately after a daring attack upon his wagon train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to know what you are doing traveling on this road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to turn back from here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont i will fight you again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to leave what you have got here and turn back from here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sudden clamor of highpitched voices broke the deadly stillness of the dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the women talked excitedly about the invulnerable red of the eagles feathers while the wouldbe heroes sulked within their wigwams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the evening of the same day sat a group of hunters around a bright burning fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were talking of a strange young man whom they spied while out upon a hunt for deer beyond the bluffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> following the point of his arrow with their eyes they beheld a herd of buffalo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it darted into the skull of the foremost buffalo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but unlike other arrows it pierced through the head of the creature and spinning in the air lit into the next buffalo head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one by one the buffalo fell upon the sweet grass they were grazing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with straight quivering limbs they lay on their sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man stood calmly by counting on his fingers the buffalo as they dropped dead to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the last one fell he ran thither and picking up his magic arrow wiped it carefully on the soft grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slipped it into his long fringed quiver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is going to make a feast for some hungry tribe of men or beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the hunters among themselves as they hastened away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were afraid of the stranger with the sacred arrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the hunters tale of the strangers arrow reached the ears of the chieftain his face brightened with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sent forth fleet horsemen to learn of him his birth his name and his deeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he is the avenger with the magic arrow sprung up from the earth out of a clot of buffalo blood bid him come hither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let him kill the red eagle with his magic arrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let him win for himself one of my beautiful daughters he had said to his messengers for the old story of the badgers manson was known all over the level lands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after four days and nights the braves returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is straight and tall handsome in face with large black eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paints his round cheeks with bright red and wears the penciled lines of red over his temples like our men of honored rank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he carries on his back a long fringed quiver in which he keeps his magic arrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is coming now to kill the big red eagle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all around the camp ground from mouth to ear passed those words of the returned messengers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sacred beast bird or reptile represented by its stuffed skin or by a rude painting was treated with reverence and carried into battle to insure the guardianship of the spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the symbolic attribute of beaver bear or tortoise such as wisdom cunning courage and the like was supposed to be mysteriously conferred upon the wearer of the badge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the totem or charm used in medicine was ordinarily that of the medicine lodge to which the practitioner belonged though there were some great men who boasted a special revelation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are two ceremonial usages which so far as i have been able to ascertain were universal among american indians and apparently fundamental <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these have already been referred to as the eneepee or vaporbath and the chanduhupahyuzapee or ceremonial of the pipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in our siouan legends and traditions these two are preeminent as handed down from the most ancient time and in our creation myth or story of the first man the vaporbath was the magic used by theonewhowasfirstcreated to give life to the dead bones of his younger brother who had been slain by the monsters of the deep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the shore of the great water he dug two round holes over one of which he built a low enclosure of fragrant cedar boughs and here he gathered together the bones of his brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the other pit he made a fire and heated four round stones which he rolled one by one into the lodge of boughs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having closed every aperture save one he sang a mystic chant while he thrust in his arm and sprinkled water upon the stones with a bunch of sage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately steam arose and as the legend says there was an appearance of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a second time he sprinkled water and the dry bones rattled together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third time he seemed to hear soft singing from within the lodge and the fourth time a voice exclaimed brother let me out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then in a somewhat groggy kind of way he began to laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six hours in the spiritual abyss and all because i never thought of the dentist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a simple such a beautiful and peaceful thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> friends we have passed a night in hell but now the sun is risen the birds are singing and the radiant form of the dentist consoles the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will get some sense out of this cried flambeau striding forward if i use the tortures of the inquisition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father brown repressed what appeared to be a momentary disposition to dance on the now sunlit lawn and cried quite piteously like a child oh let me be silly a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know how unhappy i have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now i know that there has been no deep sin in this business at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only a little lunacy perhaps and who minds that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spun round once more then faced them with gravity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is not a story of crime he said rather it is the story of a strange and crooked honesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are dealing with the one man on earth perhaps who has taken no more than his due <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a study in the savage living logic that has been the religion of this race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that old local rhyme about the house of glengyle as green sap to the simmer trees is red gold to the ogilvies was literal as well as metaphorical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did not merely mean that the glengyles sought for wealth it was also true that they literally gathered gold they had a huge collection of ornaments and utensils in that metal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were in fact misers whose mania took that turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the light of that fact run through all the things we found in the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> diamonds without their gold rings candles without their gold candlesticks snuff without the gold snuffboxes pencilleads without the gold pencilcases a walking stick without its gold top clockwork without the gold clocksor rather watches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mad as it sounds because the halos and the name of god in the old missals were of real gold these also were taken away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the garden seemed to brighten the grass to grow gayer in the strengthening sun as the crazy truth was told <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flambeau lit a cigarette as his friend went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were taken away continued father brown were taken away but not stolen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thieves would have taken the gold snuffboxes snuff and all the gold pencilcases lead and all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have to deal with a man with a peculiar conscience but certainly a conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found that mad moralist this morning in the kitchen garden yonder and i heard the whole story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the late archibald ogilvie was the nearest approach to a good man ever born at glengyle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his bitter virtue took the turn of the misanthrope he moped over the dishonesty of his ancestors from which somehow he generalised a dishonesty of all men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more especially he distrusted philanthropy or freegiving and he swore if he could find one man who took his exact rights he should have all the gold of glengyle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having delivered this defiance to humanity he shut himself up without the smallest expectation of its being answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day however a deaf and seemingly senseless lad from a distant village brought him a belated telegram and glengyle in his acrid pleasantry gave him a new farthing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least he thought he had done so but when he turned over his change he found the new farthing still there and a sovereign gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the accident offered him vistas of sneering speculation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either way the boy would show the greasy greed of the species <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either he would vanish a thief stealing a coin or he would sneak back with it virtuously a snob seeking a reward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle of that night lord glengyle was knocked up out of his bedfor he lived aloneand forced to open the door to the deaf idiot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idiot brought with him not the sovereign but exactly nineteen shillings and elevenpence threefarthings in change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the wild exactitude of this action took hold of the mad lords brain like fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he swore he was diogenes that had long sought an honest man and at last had found one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made a new will which i have seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took the literal youth into his huge neglected house and trained him up as his solitary servant and after an odd mannerhis heir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and whatever that queer creature understands he understood absolutely his lords two fixed ideas first that the letter of right is everything and second that he himself was to have the gold of glengyle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far that is all and that is simple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has stripped the house of gold and taken not a grain that was not gold not so much as a grain of snuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lifted the gold leaf off an old illumination fully satisfied that he left the rest unspoilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that i understood but i could not understand this skull business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was really uneasy about that human head buried among the potatoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will put the skull back in the grave when he has taken the gold out of the tooth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and indeed when flambeau crossed the hill that morning he saw that strange being the just miser digging at the desecrated grave the plaid round his throat thrashing out in the mountain wind the sober top hat on his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certain of the great roads going north out of london continue far into the country a sort of attenuated and interrupted spectre of a street with great gaps in the building but preserving the line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here will be a group of shops followed by a fenced field or paddock and then a famous publichouse and then perhaps a market garden or a nursery garden and then one large private house and then another field and another inn and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anyone walks along one of these roads he will pass a house which will probably catch his eye though he may not be able to explain its attraction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a long low house running parallel with the road painted mostly white and pale green with a veranda and sunblinds and porches capped with those quaint sort of cupolas like wooden umbrellas that one sees in some oldfashioned houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact it is an oldfashioned house very english and very suburban in the good old wealthy clapham sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet the house has a look of having been built chiefly for the hot weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking at its white paint and sunblinds one thinks vaguely of pugarees and even of palm trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot trace the feeling to its root perhaps the place was built by an angloindian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyone passing this house i say would be namelessly fascinated by it would feel that it was a place about which some story was to be told <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he would have been right as you shall shortly hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this is the storythe story of the strange things that did really happen in it in the whitsuntide of the year anyone passing the house on the thursday before whitsunday at about halfpast four pm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would have seen the front door open and father brown of the small church of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mungo come out smoking a large pipe in company with a very tall french friend of his called flambeau who was smoking a very small cigarette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these persons may or may not be of interest to the reader but the truth is that they were not the only interesting things that were displayed when the front door of the whiteandgreen house was opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are further peculiarities about this house which must be described to start with not only that the reader may understand this tragic tale but also that he may realise what it was that the opening of the door revealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole house was built upon the plan of a t but a t with a very long cross piece and a very short tail piece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the long cross piece was the frontage that ran along in face of the street with the front door in the middle it was two stories high and contained nearly all the important rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the short tail piece which ran out at the back immediately opposite the front door was one story high and consisted only of two long rooms the one leading into the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first of these two rooms was the study in which the celebrated mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quinton wrote his wild oriental poems and romances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have heard at least of the butterworths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did everything in the world for him they turned themselves inside out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gave him a dozen dinner parties and balls and were the means of his being invited to fifty more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first he used to come into mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butterworths box at the opera in a tweed traveling suit but someone stopped that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate he had a beautiful time and they parted the best friends in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two years elapse and the butterworths come abroad and go to london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing they see in all the papersin england those things are in the most prominent placeis that the duke of greenerin has arrived in town for the season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butterworthas polite as evergoes and leaves a card <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wait a little more the visit is not returned they wait three weekssilence de mortthe duke gives no sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the butterworths see a lot of other people put down the duke of greenerin as a rude ungrateful man and forget all about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one fine day they go to ascot races and there they meet him face to face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stares a moment and then comes up to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butterworth taking something from his pocketbooksomething which proves to be a banknote <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butterworth he says so that i can pay you that ten pounds i lost to you in new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw the other day you remembered our bet here are the ten pounds mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and off he goes and thats the last they see of the duke of greenerin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe it said the young girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> westgate you are not so simple after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> believe it or not as you please there is no smoke without fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is that the way asked bessie after a moment that you expect your friends to treat you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i defy them to treat me very ill because i shall not give them the opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the best will in the world in that case they cant be very offensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see what makes you talk that way she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exactly and that is just the way they have grown great by dropping you when you have ceased to be useful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people say they are not clever but i think they are very clever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know you have liked themall the englishmen you have seen said bessie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have liked me her sister rejoined it would be more correct to say that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bessie alden resumed for some moments her studies in sea green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well she said whether they like me or not i mean to like them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and happily she added lord lambeth does not owe me ten pounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the first few days after their arrival at joness hotel our charming americans were much occupied with what they would have called looking about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they found occasion to make a large number of purchases and their opportunities for conversation were such only as were offered by the deferential london shopmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he carried her into the lodge and there renewed his promise to stay there always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man married them and they were happy for four days but on the fifth morning oldman was gonegone with all the dried meat in the lodgethe thief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were sure that the rascal had run away the woman began to cry but not so the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got his bow and arrows and left the lodge in anger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was snow on the ground and the man took the track of oldman intending to catch and kill him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the track was fresh and the man started on a run for he was a good hunter and as fast as a deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course he gained on old man who was a much slower traveller and the sun was not very high when the old thief stopped on a hilltop to look back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this will never do he said to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what i shall do i shall turn myself into a dead bullelk and lie down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he will pass he took off his moccasins and said to them moccasins go on toward the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep going and making plain tracks in the snow toward the bigwater where the sun sleeps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queerone will follow you and when you pass out of the snowy country you can lose him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go quickly for he is close the moccasins ran away as oldman wanted them to and they made plain tracks in the snow leading away toward the bigwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old man turned into a dead bullelk and stretched himself near the tracks the moccasins had made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up the hill came the man his breath short from running <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the dead elk and thought it might be oldman playing a trick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was about to shoot an arrow into the dead elk to make sure but just as he was about to let the arrow go he saw the tracks the moc casins had made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course he thought the moccasins were on oldmans feet and that the carcass was really that of a dead elk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was badly fooled and took the tracks again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on and on he went following the moccasins over hills and rivers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faster than before went the man and still faster travelled the empty moccasins the trail growing dimmer and dim mer as the daylight faded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all day long and all of the night the man followed the tracks without rest or food and just at day break he came to the shore of the bigwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there right by the waters edge stood the empty moccasins side by side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes were red and his legs were trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right over his head he saw the black bird and knew him too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you fooled me and now you are a crow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think you will escape me do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you will not for i too know magic with a stick the man drew a cricle in the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he stood within the ring and sang a song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve found the cure for all the worlds diseases.come may find your goodhumor and come home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come and preach your saintsimonian doctrines tomorrow to kirbys hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let them have a clear idea of the rights of the soul and ill venture next week theyll strike for higher wages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you send the coachdriver to this side of the mills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke kindly it was his habit to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deborah seeing the puddler go crept after him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you say the pocket and the heart of the world speak without meaning to these people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned his head indolently and looked into the mills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there hung about the place a thick unclean odor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slightest motion of his hand marked that he perceived it and his insufferable disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may said nothing only quickened his angry tramp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides added mitchell giving a corollary to his answer it would be of no use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no vital movement of the peoples has worked down for good or evil fermented instead carried up the heaving cloggy mass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was my gun and knife and lantern and patent matches all necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then there was the real plant of the affair in hand a mortal weight of gunpowder a pair of dynamite fishingbombs and two or three pieces of slow match that i had hauled out of the tin cases and spliced together the best way i could for the match was only trade stuff and a man would be crazy that trusted it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> altogether you see i had the materials of a pretty good blowup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> expense was nothing to me i wanted that thing done right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as i was in the open and had the lamp in my house to steer by i did well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when i got to the path it fell so dark i could make no headway walking into trees and swearing there like a man looking for the matches in his bedroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew it was risky to light up for my lantern would be visible all the way to the point of the cape and as no one went there after dark it would be talked about and come to cases ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had either to give the business over and lose caste with maea or light up take my chance and get through the thing the smartest i was able <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as i was on the path i walked hard but when i came to the black beach i had to run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the tide was now nearly flowed and to get through with my powder dry between the surf and the steep hill took all the quickness i possessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was even the wash caught me to the knees and i came near falling on a stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this time the hurry i was in and the free air and smell of the sea kept my spirits lively but when i was once in the bush and began to climb the path i took it easier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fearsomeness of the wood had been a good bit rubbed off for me by master cases banjo strings and graven images yet i thought it was a dreary walk and guessed when the disciples went up there they must be badly scared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light of the lantern striking among all these trunks and forked branches and twisted ropeends of lianas made the whole place or all that you could see of it a kind of a puzzle of turning shadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came to meet you solid and quick like giants and then span off and vanished they hove up over your head like clubs and flew away into the night like birds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the floor of the bush glimmered with dead wood the way the matchbox used to shine after you had struck a lucifer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> big cold drops fell on me from the branches overhead like sweat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no wind to mention only a little icy breath of a landbreeze that stirred nothing and the harps were silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first landfall i made was when i got through the bush of wild cocoanuts and came in view of the bogies on the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mighty queer they looked by the shining of the lantern with their painted faces and shell eyes and their clothes and their hair hanging <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one after another i pulled them all up and piled them in a bundle on the cellar roof so as they might go to glory with the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i chose a place behind one of the big stones at the entrance buried my powder and the two shells and arranged my match along the passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i had a look at the smoking head just for goodbye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was my first idea to light up and be getting homeward for the darkness and the glimmer of the dead wood and the shadows of the lantern made me lonely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i knew where one of the harps hung it seemed a pity it shouldnt go with the rest and at the same time i couldnt help letting on to myself that i was mortal tired of my employment and would like best to be at home and have the door shut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stepped out of the cellar and argued it fore and back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a sound of the sea far down below me on the coast nearer hand not a leaf stirred i might have been the only living creature this side of cape horn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well as i stood there thinking it seemed the bush woke and became full of little noises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little noises they were and nothing to hurt a bit of a crackle a bit of a rush but the breath jumped right out of me and my throat went as dry as a biscuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wasnt case i was afraid of which would have been commonsense i never thought of case what took me as sharp as the colic was the old wives tales the devilwomen and the man pigs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the toss of a penny whether i should run but i got a purchase on myself and stepped out and held up the lantern like a fool and looked all round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the direction of the village and the path there was nothing to be seen but when i turned inland its a wonder to me i didnt drop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there coming right up out of the desert and the bad bush there sure enough was a devilwoman just as the way i had figured she would look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw the light shine on her bare arms and her bright eyes and there went out of me a yell so big that i thought it was my death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says the devilwoman in a kind of a high whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> follow me through this passage then that i and as he strode on his way before the supposed friar frontdeboeuf thus schooled him in the part which he desired he should act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou seest sir friar yon herd of saxon swine who have dared to environ this castle of torquilstone tell them whatever thou hast a mind of the weakness of this fortalice or aught else that can detain them before it for twentyfour hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime bear thou this scrollbut softcanst read not a jot i answered cedric save on my breviary and then i know the characters because i have the holy service by heart praised be our the fitter messenger for my purpose.carry thou this scroll to the castle of philip de malvoisin say it cometh from me and is written by the templar brian de boisguilbert and that i pray him to send it to york with all the speed man and horse can make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile tell him to doubt nothing he shall find us whole and sound behind our battlementshame on it that we should be compelled to hide thus by a pack of runagates who are wont to fly even at the flash of our pennons and the tramp of our horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say to thee priest contrive some cast of thine art to keep the knaves where they are until our friends bring up their lances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my vengeance is awake and she is a falcon by my patron saint said cedric with deeper energy than became his character and by every saint who has lived and died in england your commands shall be obeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a saxon shall stir from before these walls if i have art and influence to detain ha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said frontdeboeuf thou changest thy tone sir priest and speakest brief and bold as if thy heart were in the slaughter of the saxon herd cedric was no ready practiser of the art of dissimulation and would at this moment have been much the better of a hint from wambas more fertile brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but necessity according to the ancient proverb sharpens invention and he muttered something under his cowl concerning the men in question being excommunicated outlaws both to church and to kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> despardieux answered frontdeboeuf thou hast spoken the very truthi forgot that the knaves can strip a fat abbot as well as if they had been born south of yonder salt channel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it not he of st ives whom they tied to an oaktree and compelled to sing a mass while they were rifling his mails and his wallets?no by our ladythat jest was played by gualtier of middleton one of our own companionsatarms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they were saxons who robbed the chapel at st bees of cup they were godless men answered cedric <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay and they drank out all the good wine and ale that lay in store for many a secret carousal when ye pretend ye are but busied with vigils and primes!priest thou art bound to revenge such i am indeed bound to vengeance murmured frontdeboeuf in the meanwhile led the way to a postern where passing the moat on a single plank they reached a small barbican or exterior defence which communicated with the open field by a wellfortified sallyport <end> <end> 
<start> <start> begone then and if thou wilt do mine errand and if thou return hither when it is done thou shalt see saxon flesh cheap as ever was hogs in the shambles of sheffield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hark thee thou seemest to be a jolly confessorcome hither after the onslaught and thou shalt have as much malvoisie assuredly we shall meet again answered cedric <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something in hand the whilst continued the norman and as they parted at the postern door he thrust into cedrics reluctant hand a gold byzant adding remember i will fly off both cowl and full leave will i give thee to do both answered cedric leaving the postern and striding forth over the free field with a joyful step if when we meet next i deserve not better at thine hand.turning then back towards the castle he threw the piece of gold towards the donor exclaiming at the same time false norman thy money frontdeboeuf heard the words imperfectly but the action was suspiciousarchers he called to the warders on the outward battlements send me an arrow through yon monks frock!yet stay he said as his retainers were bending their bows it avails notwe must thus far trust him since we have no better shift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think he dares not betray meat the worst i can but treat with these saxon dogs whom i have safe in kennel.ho <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles jailor let them bring cedric of rotherwood before me and the other churl his companionhim i mean of coningsburghathelstane there or what call they him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their very names are an encumbrance to a norman knights mouth and have as it were a flavour of bacongive me a stoup of wine as jolly prince john said that i may wash away the relishplace it in the armoury and thither his commands were obeyed and upon entering that gothic apartment hung with many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father he found a flagon of wine on the massive oaken table and the two saxon captives under the guard of four of his dependants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frontdeboeuf took a long drought of wine and then addressed his prisoners for the manner in which wamba drew the cap over his face the change of dress the gloomy and broken light and the barons imperfect acquaintance with the features of cedric who avoided his norman neighbours and seldom stirred beyond his own domains prevented him from discovering that the most important of his captives had made his escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gallants of england said frontdeboeuf how relish ye your entertainment at torquilstone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are ye yet aware what your surquedy and surquedy and outrecuidanceinsolence and presumption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of a prince of the house of anjou?have ye forgotten how ye requited the unmerited hospitality of the royal john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by god and st dennis an ye pay not the richer ransom i will hang ye up by the feet from the iron bars of these windows till the kites and hooded crows have made skeletons of you!speak out ye saxon dogs what bid ye for your worthless lives?how say you you of rotherwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a doit i answered poor wambaand for hanging up by the feet my brain has been topsyturvy they say ever since the biggin was bound first round my head so turning me upside down saint genevieve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said frontdeboeuf what and with the back of his hand he struck cedrics cap from the head of the jester and throwing open his collar discovered the fatal badge of servitude the silver collar round his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the furious norman what have you brought i think i can tell you said de bracy who just entered the apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is cedrics clown who fought so manful a skirmish with isaac i shall settle it for them both replied frontdeboeuf they shall hang on the same gallows unless his master and this boar of coningsburgh will pay well for their lives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their wealth is the least they can surrender they must also carry off with them the swarms that are besetting the castle subscribe a surrender of their pretended immunities and live under us as serfs and vassals too happy if in the new world that is about to begin we leave them the breath of their nostrils.go said he to two of his attendants fetch me the right cedric hither and i pardon your error for once the rather ay but said wamba your chivalrous excellency will find there are more fools than franklins what means the knave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said frontdeboeuf looking towards his followers who lingering and loath faltered forth their belief that if this were not cedric who was there in presence they knew not what was become of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> echoed frontdeboeuf it was then the boar of rotherwood whom i ushered to the postern and dismissed with my own hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thou he said to wamba whose folly could overreach the wisdom of idiots yet more gross than thyselfi will give thee holy ordersi will shave thy crown for thee!here let them tear the scalp from his head and then pitch him headlong from the battlementsthy trade is to jest canst you deal with me better than your word noble knight whimpered forth poor wamba whose habits of buffoonery were not to be overcome even by the immediate prospect of death if you give me the red cap you propose out of a simple monk the poor wretch said de bracy is resolved to die in his vocation.frontdeboeuf you shall not slay him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give him to me to make sport for my free companions.how sayst thou knave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wilt thou take heart of grace and go to the wars with ay with my masters leave said wamba for look you i must not slip collar and he oh a norman saw will soon cut a saxon collar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay noble sir said wamba and thence norman saw on english oak on english neck a norman yoke norman spoon in english dish and england ruled as normans wish blithe world to england never will be more thou dost well de bracy said frontdeboeuf to stand there listening to a fools jargon when destruction is gaping for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seest thou not we are overreached and that our proposed mode of communicating with our friends without has been disconcerted by this same motley gentleman thou art so fond to brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what views have we to the battlements then said de bracy when didst thou ever see me the graver for the thoughts of battle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> call the templar yonder and let him fight but half so well for his life as he has done for his ordermake thou to the walls thyself with thy huge bodylet me do my poor endeavour in my own way and i tell thee the saxon outlaws may as well attempt to scale the clouds as the castle of torquilstone or if you will treat with the banditti why not employ the mediation of this worthy franklin who seems in such deep contemplation of the wineflagon?here saxon he continued addressing athelstane and handing the cup to him rinse thy throat with that noble liquor and rouse up thy soul to say what thou wilt what a man of mould may answered athelstane providing it be what a man of manhood ought.dismiss me free with my companions and and wilt moreover assure us the retreat of that scum of mankind who are swarming around the castle contrary to gods peace and the kings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in so far as i can answered athelstane i will withdraw them and i fear not but that my we are agreed then said frontdeboeuf thou and they are to be set at freedom and peace is to be on both sides for payment of a thousand marks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a trifling ransom saxon and thou wilt owe gratitude to the moderation which accepts of it in exchange of your persons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mark this nor to the jew isaacs daughter said the neither said frontdeboeuf belong to this i were unworthy to be called christian if they did replied athelstane deal with the unbelievers neither does the ransom include the lady rowena said de bracy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it shall never be said i was scared out of a fair prize without striking a neither said frontdeboeuf does our treaty refer to this wretched jester whom i retain that i may make him an example to every knave the lady rowena answered athelstane with the most steady countenance is my affianced bride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will be drawn by wild horses before i consent to part with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slave wamba has this day saved the life of my father cedrici will lose thy affianced bride?the lady rowena the affianced bride of a vassal like thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said de bracy saxon thou dreamest that the days of thy seven kingdoms are returned again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell thee the princes of the house of anjou confer not their my lineage proud norman replied athelstane is drawn from a source more pure and ancient than that of a beggarly frenchman whose living is won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his paltry standard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kings were my ancestors strong in war and wise in council who every day feasted in their hall more hundreds than thou canst number individual followers whose names have been sung by minstrels and their laws recorded by wittenagemotes whose bones were interred amid the prayers of saints and thou hast it de bracy said frontdeboeuf well pleased with the rebuff which his companion as fairly as a captive can strike said de bracy with apparent carelessness for he whose hands are tied should have his tongue at freedom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but thy glibness of reply comrade rejoined he speaking to athelstane will not win the freedom to this athelstane who had already made a longer speech than was his custom to do on any topic however interesting returned no answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a menial who announced that a monk demanded admittance at the postern gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the name of saint bennet the prince of these bullbeggars said frontdeboeuf have we a real monk this time or another impostor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> search him slavesfor an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed upon you i will have your eyes torn let me endure the extremity of your anger my lord said giles if this be not a real shaveling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your squire jocelyn knows him well and will vouch him to be brother ambrose a monk in admit him said frontdeboeuf most likely he brings us news from his jovial master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely the devil keeps holiday and the priests are relieved from duty that they are strolling thus wildly through the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remove these prisoners i claim said athelstane an honourable imprisonment with due care of my board and of my couch as becomes my rank and as is due to one who is in treaty for ransom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover i hold him that deems himself the best of you bound to answer to me with his body for this aggression on my freedom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this defiance hath already been sent to thee by thy sewer thou underliest it and art i answer not the challenge of my prisoner said frontdeboeuf nor shalt thou maurice de bracy.giles he continued hang the franklins glove upon the tine of yonder branched antlers there shall it remain until he is a free man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should he then presume to demand it or to affirm he was unlawfully made my prisoner by the belt of saint christopher he will speak to one who hath never refused to meet a foe on foot or on horseback alone the saxon prisoners were accordingly removed just as they introduced the monk ambrose who appeared to be in great perturbation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the real deus vobiscum said wamba as he passed the reverend brother the others holy mother said the monk as he addressed the assembled knights i am at last safe and safe thou art replied de bracy and for christianity here is the stout baron reginald frontdeboeuf whose utter abomination is a jew and the good knight templar brian de boisguilbert whose trade is to slay saracensif these are not good marks of christianity i know no other which they bear about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye are friends and allies of our reverend father in god aymer prior of jorvaulx said the monk without noticing the tone of de bracys reply ye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity for what saith the blessed saint augustin what saith the devil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interrupted frontdeboeuf or rather what dost thou say sir priest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have little time to hear texts from the holy sancta maria <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ejaculated father ambrose how prompt to ire are these unhallowed laymen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but be it known to you brave knights that certain murderous caitiffs casting behind them fear of god and reverence of his church and not regarding the bull of the holy see si quis suadende brother priest said the templar all this we know or guess attell us plainly is thy master surely said ambrose he is in the hands of the men of belial infesters of these woods and contemners of the holy text touch not mine here is a new argument for our swords sirs said frontdeboeuf turning to his companions and so instead of reaching us any assistance the prior of jorvaulx requests aid at our hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man is well helped of these lazy churchmen when he hath most to do!but speak out priest and say so please you said ambrose violent hands having been imposed on my reverend superior contrary to the holy ordinance which i did already quote and the men of belial having rifled his mails and budgets and stripped him of two hundred marks of pure refined gold they do yet demand of him a large sum beside ere they will suffer him to depart from their uncircumcised hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore the reverend father in god prays you as his dear friends to rescue him either by paying down the ransom at which they hold him or by force of arms the foul fiend quell the prior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said frontdeboeuf his mornings drought has been a deep one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when did thy master hear of a norman baron unbuckling his purse to relieve a churchman whose bags are ten times as weighty as ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how can we do aught by valour to free him that are cooped up here by ten times our number and that was what i was about to tell you said the monk had your hastiness allowed me time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> london is a great and grievous city and mayhappen when ye come thither it shall seem to you overgreat to deal with when ye remember the little townships and the cots ye came from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover when ye dwell here in kent ye think forsooth of your brethren in essex or suffolk and there belike an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but from london ye may have an inkling of all the world and over burdensome maybe shall that seem to you a few and a feeble people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless i say to you remember the fellowship in the hope of which ye have this day conquered and when ye come to london be wise and wary and that is as much as to say be bold and hardy for in these days are ye building a house which shall not be overthrown and the world shall not be too great or too little to hold it for indeed it shall be the world itself set free from evildoers for friends to dwell in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ceased awhile but they hearkened still as if something tomorrow we shall take the road for rochester and most like it were well to see what sir john newton in the castle may say to us for the man is no ill man and hath a tongue wellshapen for words and it were well that we had him out of the castle and away with us and that we put a word in his mouth to say to the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and wot ye well good fellows that by then we come to rochester we shall be a goodly company and ere we come to blackheath a very great company and at london bridge who shall stay our host <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore there is nought that can undo us except our own selves and our hearkening to soft words from those who would slay us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they shall bid us go home and abide peacefully with our wives and children while they the lords and councillors and lawyers imagine counsel and remedy for us and even so shall our own folly bid us and if we hearken thereto we are undone indeed for they shall fall upon our peace with war and our wives and children they shall take from us and some of us they shall hang and some they shall scourge and the others shall be their yoke beastsyea and worse for they shall lack meat more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to fools hearken not whether they be yourselves or your foemen for either shall lead you astray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the lords parley not for ye know already what they would say to you and that is churl let me bridle thee and saddle thee and eat thy livelihood that thou winnest and call thee hard names because i eat thee up and for thee speak not and do all that is the end of their parleying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore be ye bold and again bold and thrice bold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grip the bow handle the staff draw the sword and set on in the name of the fellowship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my infatuation for the oakland waterfront was quite dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt like the looks of it nor the life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt care for the drinking nor the vagrancy of it and i wandered back to the oakland free library and read the books with greater understanding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then too my mother said i had sown my wild oats and it was time i settled down to a regular job <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i got a job at the jute millsa tenhour day at ten cents an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> despite my increase in strength and general efficiency i was receiving no more than when i worked in the cannery several years before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then there was a promise of a rise to a dollar and a quarter a day after a few months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here so far as john barleycorn is concerned began a period of innocence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not know what it was to take a drink from month end to month end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not yet eighteen years old healthy and with labourhardened but unhurt muscles like any young animal i needed diversion excitement something beyond the books and the mechanical toil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the life there was healthful and athletic but too juvenile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not boy nor youth despite my paucity of years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was from the other side of life so far as concerned the young men i encountered in the ymca <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spoke another language possessed a sadder and more terrible wisdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i come to think it over i realise now that i have never had a boyhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young men were too juvenile for me too unsophisticated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i would not have minded could they have met me and helped me mentally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i had got more out of the books than they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their meagre physical experiences plus their meagre intellectual experiences made a negative sum so vast that it overbalanced their wholesome morality and healthful sports <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short i couldnt play with the pupils of a lower grade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the clean splendid young life that was theirs was denied me thanks to my earlier tutelage under john barleycorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet in the good time coming when alcohol is eliminated from the needs and the institutions of men it will be the ymca <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and similar unthinkably better and wiser and more virile congregatingplaces that will receive the men who now go to saloons to find themselves and one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime we live today here and now and we discuss today here and now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was working ten hours a day in the jute mills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to realise myself in other ways than at a machine for ten cents an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet i had had my fill of saloons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was developing unguessed and troubling potencies and proclivities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at this very stage fortunately i met louis shattuck and we became chums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis shattuck without one vicious trait was a real innocently devilish young fellow who was quite convinced that he was a sophisticated town boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i wasnt a town boy at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis was handsome and graceful and filled with love for the girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with him it was an exciting and allabsorbing pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been too busy being a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was an entirely new phase of existence which had escaped me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when i saw louis say goodbye to me raise his hat to a girl of his acquaintance and walk on with her side by side down the sidewalk i was made excited and envious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well theres only one thing to do said louis and that is you must get a girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me show you at the expense of a slight going aside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis did not know girls in their home life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had the entree to no girls home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of course i a stranger in this new world was similarly circumstanced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but further louis and i were unable to go to dancingschools or to public dances which were very good places for getting acquainted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a blacksmiths apprentice and was earning but slightly more than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we both lived at home and paid our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we had done this and bought our cigarettes and the inevitable clothes and shoes there remained to each of us for personal spending a sum that varied between seventy cents and a dollar for the week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we whacked this up shared it and sometimes loaned all of what was left of it when one of us needed it for some more gorgeous girl adventure such as carfare out to blairs park and backtwenty cents bang just like that and icecream for twothirty cents or tamales in a tamaleparlour which came cheaper and which for two cost only twenty cents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the disdain i had learned for money from the oyster pirates had never left me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt care overweeningly for it for personal gratification and in my philosophy i completed the circle finding myself as equable with the lack of a tencent piece as i was with the squandering of scores of dollars in calling all men and hangerson up to the bar to drink with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no girls home to which louis could take me and where i might be introduced to girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and louis several girls he wanted for himself and anyway in the very human nature of boys and girls ways he couldnt turn any of them over to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did persuade them to bring girl friends for me but i found them weak sisters pale and ineffectual alongside the choice specimens he had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have to do like i did he said finally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have to get one the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be remembered that louis and i were hard situated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we really had to struggle to pay our board and maintain a decent appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we met each other in the evening after the days work on the street corner or in a little candy store on a side street our sole frequentingplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we bought our cigarettes and occasionally a nickels worth of redhots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes louis and i unblushingly ate candyall we could get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither of us ever went into a but the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in quite primitive fashion as louis advised me i was to select her and make myself acquainted with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sea catch she said at last our babys going to be white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there never has been such a thing in the world as a white seal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant help that said matkah theres going to be now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she sang the low crooning seal song that all the mother seals you mustnt swim till youre six weeks old or your head will be sunk by your heels and summer gales and killer whales are bad for baby seals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are bad for baby seals dear rat as bad as bad can be but splash and grow strong and you cant be wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paddled and scrambled about by his mothers side and learned to scuffle out of the way when his father was fighting with another seal and the two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matkah used to go to sea to get things to eat and the baby was fed only once in two days but then he ate all he could and throve upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing he did was to crawl inland and there he met tens of thousands of babies of his own age and they played together like puppies went to sleep on the clean sand and played again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old people in the nurseries took no notice of them and the holluschickie kept to their own grounds and the babies had a beautiful playtime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when matkah came back from her deepsea fishing she would go straight to their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb and wait until she heard kotick bleat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she would take the straightest of straight lines in his direction striking out with her fore flippers and knocking the youngsters head over heels right and left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were always a few hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds and the babies were kept lively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as matkah told kotick so long as you dont lie in muddy water and get mange or rub the hard sand into a cut or scratch and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy sea nothing will hurt you here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little seals can no more swim than little children but they are unhappy till they learn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first time that kotick went down to the sea a wave carried him out beyond his depth and his big head sank and his little hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song and if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have drowned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled but he always kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was two weeks learning to use his flippers and all that while he floundered in and out of the water and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and took catnaps on the sand and went back again until at last he found that he truly belonged to the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions ducking under the rollers or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach or standing up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did or playing im the king of the castle on slippery weedy rocks that just stuck out of the wash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then he would see a thin fin like a big sharks fin drifting along close to shore and he knew that that was the killer whale the grampus who eats young seals when he can get them and kotick would head for the beach like an arrow and the fin would jig off slowly as if it were looking for nothing at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> late in october the seals began to leave st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauls for the deep sea by families and tribes and there was no more fighting over the nurseries and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next year said matkah to kotick you will be a holluschickie but this year you must learn how to catch fish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they set out together across the pacific and matkah showed kotick how to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little nose just out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no cradle is so comfortable as the long rocking swell of the pacific <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when kotick felt his skin tingle all over matkah told him he was learning the feel of the water and that tingly prickly feelings meant bad weather coming and he must swim hard and get away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a little time she said youll know where to swim to but just now well follow sea pig the porpoise for he is very wise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a school of porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water and little kotick followed them as fast as he could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do you know where to go to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked under <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when youre south of the sticky water he meant the equator and your tail tingles that means theres a gale in front of you and you must head north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later he caught sight of josiah bean gazing up and down the thoroughfare and acting like one demented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he counted the money last an now its gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around the corner walking as fast as he could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought he looked like a slick one he added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he led the way and josiah bean came behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old farmer looked as if he was ready to drop with fright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought of losing his wifes money was truly horrifying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh say boy weve got to catch that rascal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had noted the direction taken by the swindler and now ran across the street and into a side thoroughfare leading to where a new building was being put up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here from a workman he learned that the sharper had boarded a street car going south <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hailed the next car and both he and the old farmer got aboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this aint much use said josiah bean with quivering lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dunno how far he took himself to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us trust to luck to meet him said joe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they rode for a distance of a dozen blocks and then the car came to a halt for there was a blockade ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we may as well get off said our hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may be in one of the forward cars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they alighted and walked on past half a dozen cars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then our hero gave a cry of triumph there he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said and pointed to the swindler who stood on a car platform gazing anxiously ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such were josiah beans words as he rushed up to henry davis and grabbed the swindler by the shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slicklooking individual was thoroughly startled for he had not dreamed that the countryman would get on his track so soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned and looked at the man and also at joe and his face fell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know well enough what i am talking about answered josiah bean wrathfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want my money every cent o itan you are agoin to jail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir you are making a sad mistake said the swindler slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know nothing of you or your money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> make him get off the car put in joe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boy what have you to do with this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the swindler turning bitterly to our hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want that money went on the countryman doggedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he caught the swindler tighter than ever and made him walk to the sidewalk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time a crowd of people began to collect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes robbed me thats whats the matter answered the countryman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has got six hundred dollars o mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried several and began to take a deeper interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw him before came loudly from the swindler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was with the man who lost the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a respectable merchant from pittsburg went on the swindler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is outrageous to be accused in this fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody had better call a policeman said joe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill do dat answered a newsboy and ran off to execute the errand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the crowd began to collect the swindler saw that he was going to have difficulty in clearing himself or getting away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked around and seeing an opening made a dash for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might have gotten away had it not been for joe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but our hero was watching him with the eyes of a hawk and quick as a flash he caught the rascal by the coat sleeve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two of them are said to be brothers the one an old soldier but now a biscuitmaker the other a lame sailor but now a sailmaker the third a joiner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says john the biscuitmaker one day to thomas his brother the sailmaker brother tom what will become of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plague truly says thomas i am at a great loss what to do for i find if it comes down into wapping i shall be turned out of my lodging <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thus they began to talk of it beforehand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turned out of your lodging tom i if you are i dont know who will take you in for people are so afraid of one another now theres no getting a lodging anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the people where i lodge are good civil people and have kindness enough for me too but they say i go abroad every day to my work and it will be dangerous and they talk of locking themselves up and letting nobody come near them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why they are in the right to be sure if they resolve to venture staying in town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay i might even resolve to stay within doors too for except a suit of sails that my master has in hand and which i am just finishing i am like to get no more work a great while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> workmen and servants are turned off everywhere so that i might be glad to be locked up too but i do not see they will be willing to consent to that any more than to the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i am almost as bad as you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people where i lodge are all gone into the country but a maid and she is to go next week and to shut the house quite up so that i shall be turned adrift to the wide world before you and i am resolved to go away too if i knew but where to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were both distracted we did not go away at first then we might have travelled anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres no stirring now we shall be starved if we pretend to go out of town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wont let us have victuals no not for our money nor let us come into the towns much less into their houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that which is almost as bad i have but little money to help myself with neither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to that we might make shift i have a little though not much but i tell you theres no stirring on the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know a couple of poor honest men in our street have attempted to travel and at barnet or whetstone or thereabouts the people offered to fire at them if they pretended to go forward so they are come back again quite discouraged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would have ventured their fire if i had been there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had been denied food for my money they should have seen me take it before their faces and if i had tendered money for it they could not have taken any course with me by law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you talk your old soldiers language as if you were in the low countries now but this is a serious thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people have good reason to keep anybody off that they are not satisfied are sound at such a time as this and we must not plunder them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no brother you mistake the case and mistake me too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would plunder nobody but for any town upon the road to deny me leave to pass through the town in the open highway and deny me provisions for my money is to say the town has a right to starve me to death which cannot be true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they do not deny you liberty to go back again from whence you came and therefore they do not starve you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the next town behind me will by the same rule deny me leave to go back and so they do starve me between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides there is no law to prohibit my travelling wherever i will on the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there will be so much difficulty in disputing with them at every town on the road that it is not for poor men to do it or undertake it at such a time as this is especially <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why brother our condition at this rate is worse than anybody elses for we can neither go away nor stay here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am of the same mind with the lepers of samaria if we stay here we are sure to die i mean especially as you and i are stated without a dwellinghouse of our own and without lodging in anybody elses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no lying in the street at such a time as this we had as good go into the deadcart at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore i say if we stay here we are sure to die and if we go away we can but die i am resolved to be gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whither will you go and what can you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would as willingly go away as you if i knew whither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we were born and here we must die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look you tom the whole kingdom is my native country as well as this town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may as well say i must not go out of my house if it is on fire as that i must not go out of the town i was born in when it is infected with the plague <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was born in england and have a right to live in it if i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you know every vagrant person may by the laws of england be taken up and passed back to their last legal settlement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i desire only to travel on upon my lawful occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what lawful occasions can we pretend to travel or rather wander upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will not be put off with words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is not flying to save our lives a lawful occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and do they not all know that the fact is true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but suppose they let us pass whither shall we go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anywhere to save our lives it is time enough to consider that when we are got out of this town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i am once out of this dreadful place i care not where i go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know not what to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was about the beginning of july and though the plague was come forward in the west and north parts of the town yet all wapping as i have observed before and redriff and ratdiff and limehouse and poplar in short deptford and greenwich all both sides of the river from the hermitage and from over against it quite down to blackwall was entirely free there had not one person died of the plague in all stepney parish and not one on the south side of whitechappel road no not in any parish and yet the weekly bill was that very week risen up to it was a fortnight after this before the two brothers met again and then the case was a little altered and the plague was exceedingly advanced and the number greatly increased the bill was up at and prodigiously increasing though still both sides of the river as below kept pretty well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but some began to die in redriff and about five or six in ratdiff highway when the sailmaker came to his brother john express and in some fright for he was absolutely warned out of his lodging and had only a week to provide himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his brother john was in as bad a case for he was quite out and had only begged leave of his master the biscuitmaker to lodge in an outhouse belonging to his workhouse where he only lay upon straw with some biscuitsacks or breadsacks as they called them laid upon it and some of the same sacks to cover him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here they resolved seeing all employment being at an end and no work or wages to be had they would make the best of their way to get out of the reach of the dreadful infection and being as good husbands as they could would endeavour to live upon what they had as long as it would last and then work for more if they could get work anywhere of any kind let it be what it would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while they were considering to put this resolution in practice in the best manner they could the third man who was acquainted very well with the sailmaker came to know of the design and got leave to be one of the number and thus they prepared to set out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the man was startling he was no less startled himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leaping from the struggling forms of pierre and loge who defeated each others frantic efforts to rise he was across the barroom in three wild bounds shrieking shrilly as he leaped he bolted through the west door and cleared the verandah at a jump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loge gaining his feet was after the man in blue in an instant evidently thinking no more of cleggett than if the latter had been in madagascar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as for cleggett although he might have shot down loge a dozen times over he was so astonished at what he saw that the thought never entered his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had in fact forgotten that he held a pistol in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pierre scrambled to his feet and followed loge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cleggett running after them saw the man in the blue pajamas sprinting along the sandy margin of the bay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but loge his hat gone his coat tails level in the wind behind him and his large patent leather shoes flashing in the morning sunlight was overhauling him with long and powerful strides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cleggett saw the quarry throw a startled glance over his shoulder he was no match for the terrible loge in speed and he must have realized it with despair for he turned sharply at right angles and rushed into the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loge unhesitatingly plunged after him and had caught him by the shoulder and whirled him about before he had reached a swimming depth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they clinched in water midthigh deep and then cleggett saw loge plant his fist with scientific precision and awful force upon the point of the others jaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man in the blue pajamas collapsed he would have dropped into the water but loge caught him as he fell threw his body across a shoulder with little apparent effort and trotted back into the house with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cleggett had left his sword cane in the barroom but he judged it would be just as well to allow it to remain there for the present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned and walked meditatively across the sands when cleggett returned to the ship he found captain abernethy in conversation with a young man of deprecating manner whom the captain introduced as the rev <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i been tellin him said the capn pitching his voice shrilly above the din the workmen made and not giving the rev <end> <end> 
<start> <start> calthrop an opportunity to speak for himself i been tellin him it may be a long time before the jasper b <end> <end> 
<start> <start> calthrop who stood with downcast eyes and fingers that worked nervously at the lapels of his rusty black coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive knowed him sence he was a boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes in disgrace simeon calthrop is shrieked the captain preventing the preacher from answering cleggetts question and scorning to answer it directly himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> been kicked out of his church fur kissin a married woman and cant get another one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the capn meant another the preacher merely raised his eyes which were large and brown and slightly protuberant and murmured with a kind of brave it is true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but why do you want to go to palestine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sung in the choir and she had three children screamed capn abernethy and she limped some <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hey simeon did she have a cork foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> calthrop flushed painfully but he forced himself courageously to answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> abernethy i do not know he said humbly and with the look of a stricken animal in his big brown eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a handsome young fellow of about thirtyor he would have been handsome cleggett thought had he not been so emaciated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hair was dark and brown and inclined to curl his forehead was high and white and broad and his fingers were long and white and slender his nose was well modeled but his lips were a trifle too full <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although he belonged to one of the evangelical denominations the rev <end> <end> 
<start> <start> calthrop affected clothing very like the regulation costume of the episcopalian clergy but this clothing was now worn and torn and dusty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buttons were gone here and there the knees of the unpressed trousers were baggy and beginning to be ragged and the sole of one shoe flapped as he walked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a three days growth of beard and no baggage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when capn abernethy had delivered himself and walked away the rev <end> <end> 
<start> <start> calthrop confirmed the story of his own disgrace speaking in a low but clear voice and with a gentle and wistful smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am one of the most miserable of sinners mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have proved myself to be that most despicable thing an unworthy minister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> calthrop seemed to find the sort of satisfaction in confessing his sins to the world that the medieval flagellants found in scoring themselves with whips they struck their bodies he drew forth his soul and beat it publicly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cleggett learned that he had set himself as a punishment and a mortification the task of obtaining his daily bread by the work of his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was his intention to make a pilgrimage to jerusalem refusing all assistance except that which he earned by manual labor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after such a term of years as should satisfy all men and particularly his own spiritual sense of the genuineness of his penitence he would apply to his church for reinstatement and ask for an appointment to some difficult mission in a wild and savage country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> calthrop intimated that if he chose to accept rehabilitation on less arduous terms he might obtain it but the poignancy of his own sense of failure drove him to extremes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you sure said cleggett sternly that you are not making a luxury of this very penitence itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you sure that it would not be more acceptable to heaven if you forgave yourself more easily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> calthrop with a sigh and his calm and wistful smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am cursed with a fatal magnetism which women find it impossible to resist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i am continually tempted to permit it to exert itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the cross that i bear through life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should marry some good woman said cleggett <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not feel that i am worthy said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speaking as an orderloving man which i hope i am though i fear i am noti should say yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speaking from experience and unbiased nature i should say no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can a woman be unhappy who has only been married eight weeks to a man she chose freely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have to go back by the six oclock train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will be staying on here i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a few days to wind up aunts affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall i go to the train with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little laugh of objection came from sue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edlin has plenty of room if you dont like to stay here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt tell him i would come for certain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jude went to the widows house adjoining to let her know and returning in a few minutes sat down again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is horrible how we are circumstanced suehorrible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said abruptly with his eyes bent to the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell you all my part of the gloom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your part is that you ought not to have married him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw it before you had done it but i thought i mustnt interfere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what makes you assume all this dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> becausei can see you through your feathers my poor little bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her hand lay on the table and jude put his upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats absurd sue cried he after what weve been talking about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am more strict and formal than you if it comes to that and that you should object to such an innocent action shows that you are ridiculously inconsistent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it was too prudish she said repentantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only i have fancied it was a sort of trick of ours too frequent perhaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there you may hold it as much as you like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as it means nothing it may be bothering him needlessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellare you sure you mean it only as my cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no feelings of love left in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she winced at the hit then said curiously when did you see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so shes come back and you never told me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you will live with her now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of coursejust as you live with your husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses withered for want of attention and through them at the outer distance till her eyes began to grow moist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should you be so glad to go back to her ifif what you used to say to me is still truei mean if it were true then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could your heart go back to arabella so soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a special providence i suppose helped it on its way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are teasing me thats allbecause you think i am not happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were unhappy it would be my fault my wickedness not that i should have a right to dislike him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is considerate to me in everything and he is very interesting from the amount of general knowledge he has acquired by reading everything that comes in his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think jude that a man ought to marry a woman his own age or one younger than himself eighteen yearsas i am than he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it depends upon what they feel for each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave her no opportunity of selfsatisfaction and she had to go on unaided ii think i must be equally honest with you as you have been with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps you have seen what it is i want to say?that though i like mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phillotson as a friend i dont like himit is a torture to me tolive with him as a husband!there now i have let it out i couldnt help it although i have beenpretending i am happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now youll have a contempt for me for ever i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she bent down her face upon her hands as they lay upon the cloth and silently sobbed in little jerks that made the fragile threelegged table quiver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have only been married a month or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went on still remaining bent upon the table and sobbing into her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it is said that what a woman shrinks fromin the early days of her marriageshe shakes down to with comfortable indifference in half a dozen years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that is much like saying that the amputation of a limb is no affliction since a person gets comfortably accustomed to the use of a wooden leg or arm in the course of time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jude could hardly speak but he said i thought there was something wrong sue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is not as you think!there is nothing wrong except my own wickedness i suppose youd call ita repugnance on my part for a reason i cannot disclose and what would not be admitted as one by the world in general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what tortures me so much is the necessity of being responsive to this man whenever he wishes good as he is morally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dreadful contract to feel in a particular way in a matter whose essence is its voluntariness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish he would beat me or be faithless to me or do some open thing that i could talk about as a justification for feeling as i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he does nothing except that he has grown a little cold since he has found out how i feel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why he didnt come to the funeral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i am very miserablei dont know what to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont come near me jude because you mustnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had jumped up and put his face against hersor rather against her ear her face being inaccessible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you didi only wish toconsole you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it all arose through my being married before we met didnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would have been my wife sue wouldnt you if it hadnt been for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of replying she rose quickly and saying she was going to walk to her aunts grave in the churchyard to recover herself went out of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twenty minutes later he saw her cross the village green towards mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edlins and soon she sent a little girl to fetch her bag and tell him she was too tired to see him again that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the lonely room of his aunts house jude sat watching the cottage of the widow edlin as it disappeared behind the night shade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and disheartened and again questioned his devotional motto that all was for the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he retired to rest early but his sleep was fitful from the sense that sue was so near at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at some time near two oclock when he was beginning to sleep more soundly he was aroused by a shrill squeak that had been familiar enough to him when he lived regularly at marygreen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as was the little creatures habit it did not soon repeat its cry and probably would not do so more than once or twice but would remain bearing its torture till the morrow when the trapper would come and knock it on the head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he who in his childhood had saved the lives of the earthworms now began to picture the agonies of the rabbit from its lacerated leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it were a bad catch by the hindleg the animal would tug during the ensuing six hours till the iron teeth of the trap had stripped the legbone of its flesh when should a weakspringed instrument enable it to escape it would die in the fields from the mortification of the limb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it were a good catch namely by the foreleg the bone would be broken and the limb nearly torn in two in attempts at an impossible escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost half an hour passed and the rabbit repeated its cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jude could rest no longer till he had put it out of its pain so dressing himself quickly he descended and by the light of the moon went across the green in the direction of the sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reached the hedge bordering the widows garden when he stood still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the faint click of the trap as dragged about by the writhing animal guided him now and reaching the spot he struck the rabbit on the back of the neck with the side of his palm and it stretched itself out dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was turning away when he saw a woman looking out of the open casement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent been able to sleep at all and then i heard the rabbit and couldnt help thinking of what it suffered till i felt i must come down and kill it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am so glad you got there first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ought not to be allowed to set these steel traps ought they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jude had reached the window which was quite a low one so that she was visible down to her waist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she let go the casementstay and put her hand upon his her moonlit face regarding him wistfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you with your religious doctrines think that a married woman in trouble of a kind like mine commits a mortal sin in making a man the confidant of it as i did you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that may have been my view but my doctrines and i begin to part company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thats why i vowed i wouldnt disturb your belief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buti am so glad to see you!and oh i didnt mean to see you again now the last tie between us aunt drusilla is dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill never care about my doctrines or my religion any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me help you even if i do love you and even if you dont say it!i know what you mean but i cant admit so much as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guess what you like but dont press me to answer questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you were happy whatever i may be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so few could enter into my feelingthey would say twas my fanciful fastidiousness or something of that sort and condemn me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is none of the natural tragedies of love thats loves usual tragedy in civilized life but a tragedy artificially manufactured for people who in a natural state would find relief in parting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have been wrong perhaps for me to tell my distress to you if i had been able to tell it to anybody else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jude before i married him i had never thought out fully what marriage meant even though i knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was idiotic of methere is no excuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was old enough and i thought i was very experienced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i rushed on when i had got into that training school scrape with all the cocksureness of the fool that i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am certain one ought to be allowed to undo what one had done so ignorantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i daresay it happens to lots of women only they submit and i kick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when people of a later age look back upon the barbarous customs and superstitions of the times that we have the unhappiness to live in what will they say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how i wishi wish you must go in now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment of impulse she bent over the sill and laid her face upon his hair weeping and then imprinting a scarcely perceptible little kiss upon the top of his head withdrawing quickly so that he could not put his arms round her as otherwise he unquestionably would have done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shut the casement and he returned to his cottage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sues distressful confession recurred to judes mind all the night as being a sorrow indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning after when it was time for her to go the neighbours saw her companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path which led into the lonely road to alfredston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an hour passed before he returned along the same route and in his face there was a look of exaltation not unmixed with recklessness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had stood parting in the silent highway and their tense and passionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how far their intimacy ought to go till they had almost quarrelled and she said tearfully that it was hardly proper of him as a parson in embryo to think of such a thing as kissing her even in farewell as he now wished to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she had conceded that the fact of the kiss would be nothing all would depend upon the spirit of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if given in the spirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection if in the spirit of a lover she could not permit it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you swear that it will not be in that spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they had turned from each other in estrangement and gone their several ways till at a distance of twenty or thirty yards both had looked round simultaneously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that look behind was fatal to the reserve hitherto more or less maintained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had quickly run back and met and embracing most unpremeditatedly kissed close and long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they parted for good it was with flushed cheeks on her side and a beating heart on his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kiss was a turningpoint in judes career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> back again in the cottage and left to reflection he saw one thing that though his kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his faultful life as long as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it was glaringly inconsistent for him to pursue the idea of becoming the soldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded as at its best a frailty and at its worst damnation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what sue had said in warmth was really the cold truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children have not been home for three days the weather has been so bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not know what is happeningit came suddenly two months before we expected it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jurgis was standing by the table and he caught himself with his hand his head sank and his arms shookit looked as if he were going to collapse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly aniele got up and came hobbling toward him fumbling in her skirt pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she drew out a dirty rag in one corner of which she had something tied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she unwrapped it and counted it outthirtyfour cents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you go now she said and try and get somebody yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and maybe the rest can helpgive him some money you he will pay you back some day and it will do him good to have something to think about even if he doesnt succeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he comes back maybe it will be over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so the other women turned out the contents of their pocketbooks most of them had only pennies and nickels but they gave him all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olszewski who lived next door and had a husband who was a skilled cattle butcher but a drinking man gave nearly half a dollar enough to raise the whole sum to a dollar and a quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then jurgis thrust it into his pocket still holding it tightly in his fist and started away at a run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame haupt hebamme ran a sign swinging from a secondstory window over a saloon on the avenue at a side door was another sign with a hand pointing up a dingy flight of stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jurgis went up them three at a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame haupt was frying pork and onions and had her door half open to let out the smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he tried to knock upon it it swung open the rest of the way and he had a glimpse of her with a black bottle turned up to her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he knocked louder and she started and put it away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a dutchwoman enormously fatwhen she walked she rolled like a small boat on the ocean and the dishes in the cupboard jostled each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore a filthy blue wrapper and her teeth were black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had run like mad all the way and was so out of breath he could hardly speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hair was flying and his eyes wildhe looked like a man that had risen from the tomb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame haupt set the frying pan to one side and wiped her hands on her wrapper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you vant me to come for a case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i haf yust come back from a case she said <end> <end>

<start> <start> he flung up his hands with a gesture of despair and turned and started away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its no use i vill make it five dollars for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you vill be foolish not to take such an offer she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you vont find nobody go out on a rainy day like dis for less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vy i haf never took a case in my life so sheap as dot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt pay mine room rent jurgis interrupted her with an oath of rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i havent got it he shouted how can i pay it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damn it i would pay you if i could but i tell you i havent got it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you hear me i havent got it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was halfway down the stairs before madame haupt could shout to him vait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not goot to tink of anybody suffering she said in a melancholy voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might as vell go mit you for noffing as vot you offer me but i vill try to help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gott in himmel it ought to be vorth more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vun dollar und a quarter und a day like dis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you understand nowyou vill pay me de rest of twentyfive dollars soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jurgis put the money on the table and the woman counted it and stowed it away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she wiped her greasy hands again and proceeded to get ready complaining all the time she was so fat that it was painful for her to move and she grunted and gasped at every step <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took off her wrapper without even taking the trouble to turn her back to jurgis and put on her corsets and dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was a black bonnet which had to be adjusted carefully and an umbrella which was mislaid and a bag full of necessaries which had to be collected from here and therethe man being nearly crazy with anxiety in the meantime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were on the street he kept about four paces ahead of her turning now and then as if he could hurry her on by the force of his desire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but madame haupt could only go so far at a step and it took all her attention to get the needed breath for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came at last to the house and to the group of frightened women in the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not over yet jurgis learnedhe heard ona crying still and meantime madame haupt removed her bonnet and laid it on the mantelpiece and got out of her bag first an old dress and then a saucer of goose grease which she proceeded to rub upon her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more cases this goose grease is used in the better luck it brings to the midwife and so she keeps it upon her kitchen mantelpiece or stowed away in a cupboard with her dirty clothes for months and sometimes even for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they escorted her to the ladder and jurgis heard her give an exclamation of dismay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gott in himmel vot for haf you brought me to a place like dis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not git troo a trap door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i vill not try itvy i might kill myself already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vot sort of a place is dot for a woman to bear a child in up in a garret mit only a ladder to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jurgis stood in the doorway and listened to her scolding half drowning out the horrible moans and screams of ona <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last aniele succeeded in pacifying her and she essayed the ascent then however she had to be stopped while the old woman cautioned her about the floor of the garret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had no real floorthey had laid old boards in one part to make a place for the family to live it was all right and safe there but the other part of the garret had only the joists of the floor and the lath and plaster of the ceiling below and if one stepped on this there would be a catastrophe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was half dark up above perhaps one of the others had best go up first with a candle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there were more outcries and threatening until at last jurgis had a vision of a pair of elephantine legs disappearing through the trap door and felt the house shake as madame haupt started to walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly aniele came to him and took him by the arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do as i tell youyou have done all you can and you are only in the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go on the street if there is no other placeonly go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the end she and marija pushed him out of the door and shut it behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was just about sundown and it was turning cold the rain had changed to snow and the slush was freezing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jurgis shivered in his thin clothing and put his hands into his pockets and started away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not eaten since morning and he felt weak and ill with a sudden throb of hope he recollected he was only a few blocks from the saloon where he had been wont to eat his dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they might have mercy on him there or he might meet a friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he set out for the place as fast as he could walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hello jack said the saloonkeeper when he enteredthey call all foreigners and unskilled men jack in packingtown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been in jail he said and ive just got out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walked home all the way and ive not a cent and had nothing to eat since this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ive lost my home and my wifes ill and im done up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the saloonkeeper gazed at him with his haggard white face and his blue trembling lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he pushed a big bottle toward him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jurgis could hardly hold the bottle his hands shook so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont be afraid said the saloonkeeper fill her up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so jurgis drank a large glass of whisky and then turned to the lunch counter in obedience to the others suggestion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ate all he dared stuffing it in as fast as he could and then after trying to speak his gratitude he went and sat down by the big red stove in the middle of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was too good to last howeverlike all things in this hard world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his soaked clothing began to steam and the horrible stench of fertilizer to fill the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an hour or so the packing houses would be closing and the men coming in from their work and they would not come into a place that smelt of jurgis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also it was saturday night and in a couple of hours would come a violin and a cornet and in the rear part of the saloon the families of the neighborhood would dance and feast upon wienerwurst and lager until two or three oclock in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stammered the man not knowing whether to believe his eyes or his ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this boy who fought like a demon and talked like a saint and who though battered and bruised prattled of the beautiful world he had found was most disconcerting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then still more softly hes the little tramp boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh said the man his face clearing and his eyes showing a quick sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre the boy at the holly farmhouse are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he plays the fiddle everywhere volunteered the little girl with ardent admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you hadnt been shut up sick just now youd have heard him yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> murmured jack politely shuddering a little at what he fancied would come from a violin played by a boy like the one before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack could play the violin himself a littleenough to know it some and love it more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hmm well and what else do you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing except to go for walks and read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are real ones all right said marston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them killed a revenue officer at that front door last week and was killed by the posse as he was trying to escape out of the back window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that house will be in ashes soon he added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we rode down the mountain we told him about our trip and the people with whom we had spent the nightand all the time he was smiling curiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mart had him posted down there on the river to toll you to his houseto toll you he added to the blight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pulled in his horse suddenly turned and looked up toward the top of the mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the edge of the cliff far upward on which the blind tiger sat was a gray horse and on it was a man who motionless was looking down at us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes been following you all the way said the engineer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats mart up theremy friend and yours said marston to the blight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im rather glad i didnt meet you on the other side of the mountainthats the wild dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blight looked incredulous but marston knew the man and knew the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so marthardworking martwas the wild dog and he was content to do the blight all service without thanks merely for the privilege of secretly seeing her face now and then and yet he would not look upon that face when she was a guest under his roof and asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still when we dropped behind the two girls i gave marston the hon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sams warning and for a moment he looked rather grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he said smiling if im found in the road some day youll know i shook my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no he isnt i dont know said marston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am seeking somebody said i and it comes in my mind that you will have news of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and very foolishly instead of showing him the button i sought to pass a shilling in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very much affronted he said and this is not the way that one shentleman should behave to another at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man you ask for is in france but if he was in my sporran says he and your belly full of shillings i would not hurt a hair upon his body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw i had gone the wrong way to work and without wasting time upon apologies showed him the button lying in the hollow of my palm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aweel aweel said neil and i think ye might have begun with that end of the stick whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if ye are the lad with the silver button all is well and i have the word to see that ye come safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if ye will pardon me to speak plainly says he there is a name that you should never take into your mouth and that is the name of alan breck and there is a thing that ye would never do and that is to offer your dirty money to a hieland shentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not very easy to apologise for i could scarce tell him what was the truth that i had never dreamed he would set up to be a gentleman until he told me so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neil on his part had no wish to prolong his dealings with me only to fulfil his orders and be done with it and he made haste to give me my route <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was to lie the night in kinlochaline in the public inn to cross morven the next day to ardgour and lie the night in the house of one john of the claymore who was warned that i might come the third day to be set across one loch at corran and another at balachulish and then ask my way to the house of james of the glens at aucharn in duror of appin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a good deal of ferrying as you hear the sea in all this part running deep into the mountains and winding about their roots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it makes the country strong to hold and difficult to travel but full of prodigious wild and dreadful prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had some other advice from neil to speak with no one by the way to avoid whigs campbells and the redsoldiers to leave the road and lie in a bush if i saw any of the latter coming for it was never chancy to meet in with them and in brief to conduct myself like a robber or a jacobite agent as perhaps neil thought me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inn at kinlochaline was the most beggarly vile place that ever pigs were styed in full of smoke vermin and silent highlanders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not only discontented with my lodging but with myself for my mismanagement of neil and thought i could hardly be worse off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but very wrongly as i was soon to see for i had not been half an hour at the inn standing in the door most of the time to ease my eyes from the peat smoke when a thunderstorm came close by the springs broke in a little hill on which the inn stood and one end of the house became a running water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> places of public entertainment were bad enough all over scotland in those days yet it was a wonder to myself when i had to go from the fireside to the bed in which i slept wading over the shoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early in my next days journey i overtook a little stout solemn man walking very slowly with his toes turned out sometimes reading in a book and sometimes marking the place with his finger and dressed decently and plainly in something of a clerical style <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i found to be another catechist but of a different order from the blind man of mull being indeed one of those sent out by the edinburgh society for propagating christian knowledge to evangelise the more savage places of the highlands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his name was henderland he spoke with the broad southcountry tongue which i was beginning to weary for the sound of and besides common countryship we soon found we had a more particular bond of interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my good friend the minister of essendean had translated into the gaelic in his bytime a number of hymns and pious books which henderland used in his work and held in great esteem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed it was one of these he was carrying and reading when we met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we fell in company at once our ways lying together as far as to kingairloch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we went he stopped and spoke with all the wayfarers and workers that we met or passed and though of course i could not tell what they discoursed about yet i judged mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henderland must be well liked in the countryside for i observed many of them to bring out their mulls and share a pinch of snuff with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him as far in my affairs as i judged wise as far that is as they were none of alans and gave balachulish as the place i was travelling to to meet a friend for i thought aucharn or even duror would be too particular and might put him on the scent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his part he told me much of his work and the people he worked among the hiding priests and jacobites the disarming act the dress and many other curiosities of the time and place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed moderate blaming parliament in several points and especially because they had framed the act more severely against those who wore the dress than against those who carried weapons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this moderation put it in my mind to question him of the red fox and the appin tenants questions which i thought would seem natural enough in the mouth of one travelling to that country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its wonderful said he where the tenants find the money for their life is mere starvation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye dont carry such a thing as snuff do ye mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but these tenants as i was saying are doubtless partly driven to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> james stewart in duror thats him they call james of the glens is halfbrother to ardshiel the captain of the clan and he is a man much looked up to and drives very hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then theres one they call alan breck ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what of the wind that bloweth where it listeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes here and awa here today and gone tomorrow a fair heathercat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might be glowering at the two of us out of yon whinbush and i wouldnae wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yell no carry such a thing as snuff will ye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him no and that he had asked the same thing more than once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it seems strange ye shouldnae carry it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however as i was saying this alan breck is a bold desperate customer and well kent to be jamess right hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his life is forfeit already he would boggle at naething and maybe if a tenantbody was to hang back he would get a dirk in his wame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you make a poor story of it all mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it is all fear upon both sides i care to hear no more of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henderland but theres love too and selfdenial that should put the like of you and me to shame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres something fine about it no perhaps christian but humanly fine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even alan breck by all that i hear is a chield to be respected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres many a lying sneckdraw sits close in kirk in our own part of the country and stands well in the worlds eye and maybe is a far worse man mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> balfour than yon misguided shedder of mans blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay ay we might take a lesson by them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yell perhaps think ive been too long in the hielands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him not at all that i had seen much to admire among the highlanders and if he came to that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is to turn the tenants out by force i hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes says he but the business has gone back and forth as folk say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but finally they missed his cheery voice and as their master always sang or whistled on his journeys the silence warned them that something was wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little wisk stuck out his head from underneath the seat and found santa claus gone and no one to direct the flight of the reindeer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called out and the deer obediently slackened speed and came to a halt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they thought the old men would die and the young men be so ill and weary that they could not bring up families and so the race would vanish away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in spite of the work and suffering the israelites remained strong and more and more boys grew up to make the king afraid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he did the wickedest thing of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ordered his soldiers to kill every boy baby that should be born in an israelitish family he did not care about the girls because they could not grow up to fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very soon after this evil order a boy baby was born in a certain israelitish family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his mother first looked at him her heart was nearly broken for he was even more beautiful than most babies areso strong and fair and sweet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow she contrived to keep him hidden for three whole months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the end of that time she saw that it was not going to be possible to keep him safe any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been thinking all this time about what she should do and now she carried out her plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first she took a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it all over with pitch so that it was watertight and then she laid the baby in it then she carried it to the edge of the river and laid it in the flags by the rivers brink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did not show at all unless one were quite near it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she kissed her little son and left him there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his sister stood far off not seeming to watch but really watching carefully to see what would happen to the baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon there was the sound of talk and laughter and a train of beautiful women came down to the waters edge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the kings daughter come down to bathe in the river with her maidens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the maidens walked along by the rivers side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the kings daughter came near to the water she saw the strange little basket lying in the flags and she sent her maid to bring it to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she had opened it she saw the child the poor baby was crying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she saw him so helpless and so beautiful crying for his mother the kings daughter pitied him and loved him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew the cruel order of her father and she said at once this is one of the hebrews children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that moment the babys sister came to the princess and said shall i go and find thee a nurse from the hebrew women so that she may nurse the child for thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a word did she say about whose child it was but perhaps the princess guessed i dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at all events she told the little girl to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the maiden went and brought her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the kings daughter said to the babys mother take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee wages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and can you think how happy the babys mother was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for now the baby would be known only as the princesss adopted child and would be safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother kept him until he was old enough to be taken to the princesss palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he was brought and given to the kings daughter and he became her son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the strangest part of the whole story is that when moses grew to be a man he became so strong and wise that it was he who at last saved his people from the king and conquered the egyptians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the one child saved by the kings own daughter was the very one the king would most have wanted to kill if he had known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adapted from the facts given in the german of die zehn feeen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once upon a time there was a dear little girl whose name was elsa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elsas father and mother worked very hard and became rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they loved elsa so much that they did not like to have her do any work very foolishly they let her play all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so when elsa grew up she did not know how to do anything she could not make bread she could not sweep a room she could not sew a seam she could only laugh and sing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she was so sweet and merry that everybody loved her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by and by she married one of the people who loved her and had a house of her own to take care of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then then my dears came hard times for elsa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were so many things to be done in the house and she did not know how to do any of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and because she had never worked at all it made her very tired even to try she was tired before the morning was over every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the maid would come and say how shall i do this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and elsa would have to say i dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the maid would pretend that she did not know either and when she saw her mistress sitting about doing nothing she too sat about idle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elsas husband had a hard time of it he did not have good things to eat and they were not ready at the right time and the house looked all in a clutter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made him sad and that made elsa sad for she wanted to do everything just right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last one day elsas husband went away quite cross he said to her as he went out the door it is no wonder that the house looks so when you sit all day with your hands in your lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little elsa cried bitterly when he was gone for she did not want to make her husband unhappy and cross and she wanted the house to look nice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh dear she sobbed i wish i could do things right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wishi wish i had ten good fairies to work for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i offered to help him with my money and he promised me a letter to cardinal napoli <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it reached me on my return to rome and through the influence of the cardinal i was given an audience with the pope and i was encouraged to aid father paul as far as i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had meant to build a memorial church for father but they urged me to give the money instead to this cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all my dealings until today have been with father paul alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen a little of the prince kalonay because they are always together but he has always treated me in a way to which no one could take exception and he is certainly very much in earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when father paul left paris mother and i came on here in order to be near him and that is how you find me at tangier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now that you understand how much this means to me i know you will not do anything to stand in our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those men inside are afraid that you came here for just the reason that apparently has brought you and when they saw you a little while ago through the windows they were greatly disturbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me tell them that you mean to volunteer for the campaign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king cannot refuse the services of a man who has done the things you are always doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i promise you that for a reward you shall be the only one to tell the story of our attempt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i promise you she repeated earnestly that the day we enter the capital you can cable whatever you please and tell our story to the whole of europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have made this a much more serious business than a newspaper story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am here now because i am not going to have you compromised and robbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl stood up and looked down at the young man indignantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have no right whatever to use that tone to me she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am of age and my own adviser <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am acting for the good of a great number of people and according to what my conscience and common sense tell me is right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall hate you if you attempt to interfere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can do one of two things archie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i give you your choice you can either go with them as a volunteer and promise to keep our secret or you can cable what you know now what you know only by accident but if you do you will lose your best friend and you will defeat a good and a noble effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gordon leaned back in his chair and looked up at her steadily for a brief moment and then rose with a smile and bowed to the two women in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he crossed the terrace quickly with an amused and puzzled countenance and walked into the breakfastroom from the windows of which as he rightly guessed the five conspirators had for some time observed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked from one to the other of the men about the table until his eyes finally met those of the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe sir you are leading an expedition against the republic of messina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid it cant start unless you take me with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again when i had left my study and was passing through the familiar rooms again the hope came to me that nothing had happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the odor of the drugs iodoform and phenic acid brought me back to a sense of reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in passing through the hall beside the childrens chamber i saw little lise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was looking at me with eyes that were full of fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i even thought that all the children were looking at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i approached the door of our sleepingroom a servant opened it from within and came out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing that i noticed was her light gray dress upon a chair all dark with blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on our common bed she was stretched with knees drawn up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lay very high upon pillows with her chemise half open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a heavy smell of iodoform filled the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before and more than anything else i was astonished at her face which was swollen and bruised under the eyes and over a part of the nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the result of the blow that i had struck her with my elbow when she had tried to hold me back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes probably she repents thought i shall i forgive her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she is dying i must forgive her i added trying to be generous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with difficulty she raised her eyes and in her face through the physical sufferings in spite of the approach of death was expressed the same old hatred so familiar to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children i will not give them to you all the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of that which i considered essential of her fault of her treason one would have said that she did not think it necessary to say even a word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the door stood her sister with the children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cast a glance at the children and then at her bruised and swollen face and for the first time i forgot myself my rights my pride and for the first time i saw in her a human being a sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all that which a moment before had been so offensive to me now seemed to me so pettyall this jealousyand on the contrary what i had done seemed to me so important that i felt but i did not dare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was silent with eyelids lowered evidently having no strength to speak further <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then her deformed face began to tremble and shrivel and she feebly pushed me back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes if you had not killed me she cried suddenly and her eyes shone feverishly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fire i do not fear but strike them all he has gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she no longer recognized the children not even little lise who had approached <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for me i was arrested before her death at eight oclock in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they took me to the police station and then to prison and there during eleven months awaiting the verdict i reflected upon myself and upon my past and i understood it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i began to understand from the third day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third day they took me to the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> posdnicheff seemed to wish to add something but no longer having the strength to repress his sobs he stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a few i began to understand only when i saw her in the coffin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then only when i saw her dead face did i understand all that i had done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understood that it was i i who had killed her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understood that i was the cause of the fact that she who had been a moving living palpitating being had now become motionless and cold and that there was no way of repairing this thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he who has not lived through that cannot understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face had become delicate and long and his mouth had grown larger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said he suddenly if i had known what i now know i should never have married her never not for anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again we remained silent for a long time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes that is what i have done that is my experience we must understand the real meaning of the words of the gospelmatthew v <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery and these words relate to the wife to the sister and not only to the wife of another but especially to ones own wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the reading of this book has interested you do not fail to get its sequel entitled kreutzer sonata bearing fruit by pauline grayson which is an exceedingly interesting narrative showing one of the results of the ideas set forth in kreutzer sonata <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is bound in paper covers and will be sent by mail postage paid upon receipt of cents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had no brain no wit no culture on an animal basis a woman would look twice before shed send him away but with such fanatics as pryors one cant always tell what will happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a case like this one can be reasonably certain said mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know what social position they occupied at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve no such notions here as they have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank god for so much at any rate said mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how old england would rise up and exult if she had a man in line with laddies body blood and brain to set on her throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this talk about class and social position makes me sick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men are men and laddie is as much above the customary timber found in kings and princes physically and mentally as the sky is above the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i catch it coming from any of mine save you i will beat it out of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has admitted hes in love with the girl the real question is whether shes fit to be his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should say she appears so said father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when its a question of lifetime misery and the souls salvation of my son if things go wrong ive no time for appearances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might have known he would make her angry when he laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she punched the pillow and wouldnt say another word so i went to sleep and didnt miss anything that time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next morning at breakfast laddie was beaming and father hardly waited to ask the blessing before he inquired well how did you make it son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laddie laughed and answered altogether it might have been much worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was all he would say until miss amelia started to school then he took me on his lap and talked as he buttoned my coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thomas met me at the gate he said and held my horse while i went to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of their women opened it and i inquired for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said he was in the field looking at the horses so i asked for miss pryor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she came in a minute so i gave her the branch told her about it and offered the jelly and cake for her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told her i couldnt without her fathers permission so i went to the field to see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dogs were with him and he had the surprise of his life when his maneaters rolled at my feet and licked my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> told thomas theyd been overfed and didnt amount to a brass farthing to take them to the woods and shoot them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thomas said hed see to it the very first thing in the morning and then mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pryor told him he would shoot him if he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i told him id been at the house to carry a little gift to his wife and daughter and to inquire if i might visit an hour and as he was not there i had come to the field to ask him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill warrant the women asked you to come in he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss pryor was so kind i answered but i enter no mans house without his permission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i talk with your daughter an it makes no earthly difference to me he said which was not gracious but might have been worse so i thanked him and went back to the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i knocked the second time the princess came and i told her the word was that it made no difference to her father if i came in so she opened the door widely took my hat and offered me a seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she went to the next room and said mother father has given mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she came at once offering her hand and saying i have already met mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stanton so often really we should have the privilege of speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she meant that i have haunted the road passing their place for two years and shed seen me so frequently that she came to recognize me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i sharpened all the wits i had and went to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never tried so hard in my life to be entertaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i had to feel my way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id no idea what would interest a delicate high bred ladymother sniffed againso i had to search and probe and go by guess until i saw a shade of interest then i worked in more of the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was easy enough to talk to the princess all young folks have a lot in common we could get along on fifty topics it was different with the housebound mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did my best and after a while mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked him if any of his horses had been attacked with the trouble some of the neighbours were having and told him what it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said he would tell thomas not to tie his horse at the public hitching rack when he went to town and once he got started he was wild to talk with a man and id no chance to say a word to the women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was interested in our colleges state and national laws in land development and everything that all live men are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a maid announced dinner i apologized for having stayed so long and excused myself because i had been so interested but mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pryor merely said im waiting to be well you should have seen me drop my hat and step up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did my best and while i talked to him a little i made it most to the women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any one could see they were starved for company so i took the job of entertaining them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told some college jokes funny things that had happened in the neighbourhood and everything of interest i could think up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know we were at the table for two hours with things coming and going on silver platters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just what did they have to eat and how did they serve it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> couldnt tell if i were to be shot for it mummy said laddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this first plunge i had to use all my brains not to be a bore to them and to handle food and cutlery as the women did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its quite a process but as they were served first i could do right by waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never was where things were done quite so elaborately before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they didnt know they would have company until you went to the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well they must have thought likely there was a place for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then any one who drops in can be served and see that they are not a mite of trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought youd get something out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we left the table and talked an hour more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the women asked me to come again he didnt say anything on that subject but when he ordered my horse he asked the princess if she would enjoy a little exercise and she said she would so he told thomas to bring their horses and we rode around the section the princess and i ahead mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where the road was good and the light fine enough that there was no danger of laming a horse we dropped back one on either side of him so we could talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pryor ate the cake and said it was fine and the conserve she called it delicious as she ever had tasted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said all our fruits here had much more flavour than at home she thought it was the dryer climate and more sunshine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sent her grateful thanks and she wants your recipe before next preserving time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she did love to have the things she cooked bragged on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there isnt a doubt about it said laddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive yet to see the first person who doesnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can think of nothing more at this minute answered laddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anything comes to my mind later i wont forget to tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes there was one thing you couldnt keep mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must have taken a great fancy to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he talked until he worried the princess and she tried to keep him away from the subject but his mind seemed to run on it constantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we were riding she talked quite as much as he and it will hustle us to think what the little scamp did any bigger than they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course father you understood the price mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pryor made on one of his very finest colts was a joke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a strain of arab in the fatherhe showed me the record and the mother is bluegrass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there you get gentleness and endurance combined with speed and nerve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id trade flos for that colt as it stands today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres nothing better on earth in the way of horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know with the records to prove its pedigree what that colt would bring him in any city market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want leon to have a horse but a boy in a first experience and reckless as he is doesnt need a horse like that for one thing and what is more important i refuse to be put under any obligations to pryors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pryor asked anything at all for the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is my opinion that he would be greatly pleased to give it to leon if he could do what he liked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well thats precisely the thing he cant do in this family said mother sternly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to that proposition said father but i would have to take time to thresh it out completely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeals to me that leon is old enough to recognize the value of the animal and that the care of it would develop and strengthen his character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be a responsibility that would steady him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you could teach him to tend and break it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why father hes riding it bareback all over the pryor meadow now and jumping it over logs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever he leaves it follows him to the fence and the princess says almost any hour of the day you look out you can see it pacing up and down watching this way and whinnying for him to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laddie laughed as he tied my hood strings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont feel about the pryors as the rest of you do he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the money isnt claimed inside the time you specified i would let leon and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy wont know for years that it is practically a gift and it would please mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to go so i didnt know how they settled it but if they wouldnt let leon have that horse it was downright mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what if we were under obligations to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were to sarah hood and half the people we knew and what was more we liked to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i came from school that night father had been to town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had an ax and was opening a big crate containing two of the largest bluest geese you ever saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laddie said being boxed that way and seeing them so close made them look so big really they were no finer than pryors where he had got the address of the place that sold them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said she had needed a new strain for a long time to improve her feathers now she would have pillows worth while in a few years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they put them in the barn where our geese stayed over night and how they did scream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is one of them did the other acted queerly and father said to laddie that he was afraid the trip was hard on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laddie said it might have been hurt and mother was worried too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before she had them an hour she had sold all our ganders spring had come she had saved the blue goose eggs set them under a hen raised the goslings with the little chickens never lost one picked them and made a new pair of pillows too fine for any one less important than a bishop or a judge or dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and still the goose didnt act as spry or feel as good as the gander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stuck up his head screamed spread his wings and waved them and the butts looked so big and hard i was not right certain whether it would be safe to tease him or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first person who came to see them was sarah hood and she left with the promise of a pair as soon as mother could raise them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father said the only reason mother didnt divide her hair with sarah hood was because it was fast and she couldnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shed be glad to get rid of some of it if she could and of course sarah should have first chance at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hadnt she kept her over night so she could see her new home when she was rested and didnt she come with her and help her get settled and had she ever failed when we had a baby or sickness or trouble or thrashers or a party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course shed gladly divide even the hair of her head with sarah hood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and father said yes he guessed she would and come to think of it hed just as soon spare sarah part of his and then they both laughed when it was nothing so very funny that i could see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next caller the geese had was mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mother promised her a couple of eggs to set under a hen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father said she was gradually coming down the scale of her feelings and before two weeks shed give isaac thomas at least a quill for a pen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost no one wrote with them any more but often father made a few and showed us how to use them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said they were gone with candles sand boxes and snuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mother said she had no use for snuff but candles were not gone shed make and use them to the day of her death as they were the nicest light ever invented to carry from room to room or when you only wanted to sit and think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father said there was really no good pen except the quill you sharpened yourself and while he often used steel ones like we children had at school to write to the brothers and sisters away and his family he always kept a few choice quills in the till of his chest and when he wrote a deed or any valuable paper where there was a deal with money he used them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said it lent the dignity of a past day to an important occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freshett had talked over every single thing about the geese and that they were like pryors had been settled mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freshett said since he told about it before all of us and started out the way he did would it be amiss to ask how laddie got on at pryors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just the way i thought he would said mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stayed until all of us were in bed and id never have known when he came in if it were not a habit of his always to come to my door to see if im sleeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes im wakeful and if he pommels my pillow good brings me a drink and rubs my head a few strokes with his strong cool hands i can settle down and have a good nights rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was awake when he came or id never have known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was almost midnight but they sat two hours at the table and then all of them rode <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course everybody knew that the deed with which the accused was charged had been done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had loved the princess and neither he she nor any one else thought of denying the fact but the king would not think of allowing any fact of this kind to interfere with the workings of the tribunal in which he took such great delight and satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were other people staying there and at the end of the week we all traveled back to london together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were six of us in the carriage colonel elbourn and his wife and their daughter a girl of seventeen and another married couple the bretts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been at winchester with brett but had hardly seen him since that time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was in the indian civil and was home on leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife was to remain in england for some months and then join him out there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told me that this was her age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only trouble had been that on the last night at dinner my uncle asked me if i still went in for the gipsy business as he always called it and of course the three ladies were immensely excited and implored me to do their hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told them it was all nonsense i said i had forgotten all i once knew i made various excuses and the matter dropped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite true that i had given up reading hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i avoided anything that might remind me of what was in my own hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the minute afterward she became only a bird and with a screech and a chatter spread her wings and flew away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prince dolor fell into a kind of swoon of utter misery bewilderment and exhaustion and when he awoke he found himself in his own room alone and quietwith the dawn just breaking and the long rim of yellow light in the horizon glimmering through the windowpanes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when prince dolor sat up in bed trying to remember where he was whither he had been and what he had seen the day before he perceived that his room was empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> generally his nurse rather worried him by breaking his slumbers coming in and setting things to rights as she called it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the dust lay thick upon chairs and tables there was no harsh voice heard to scold him for not getting up immediately which i am sorry to say this boy did not always do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he so enjoyed lying still and thinking lazily about everything or nothing that if he had not tried hard against it two little men who lay in their bed till the clock struck ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was striking ten now and still no nurse was to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was rather relieved at first for he felt so tired and besides when he stretched out his arm he found to his dismay that he had gone to bed in his clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very uncomfortable he felt of course and just a little frightened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> especially when he began to call and call again but nobody answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often he used to think how nice it would be to get rid of his nurse and live in this tower all by himselflike a sort of monarch able to do everything he liked and leave undone all that he did not want to do but now that this seemed really to have happened he did not like it at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come back and i will be the best boy in all the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she did not come back and nothing but silence answered his lamentable call he very nearly began to cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this wont do he said at last dashing the tears from his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its just like a baby and im a big boyshall be a man some day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sprang out of bednot to his feet alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to his poor little weak knees and crawled on them from room to room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the four chambers were desertednot forlorn or untidy for everything seemed to have been done for his comfort the breakfast and dinner things were laid the food spread in order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might live like a prince as the proverb is for several days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the place was entirely forsakenthere was evidently not a creature but himself in the solitary tower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great fear came upon the poor boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lonely as his life had been he had never known what it was to be absolutely alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a kind of despair seized himno violent anger or terror but a sort of patient desolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what in the world am i to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thought he and sat down in the middle of the floor half inclined to believe that it would be better to give up entirely lay himself down and die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this feeling however did not last long for he was young and strong and i said before by nature a very courageous boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came into his head somehow or other a proverb that his nurse had taught himthe people of nomansland for every evil under the sun there is a remedy or theres none if there is one try to find it if there isnt never mind it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder is there a remedy now and could i find it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the prince jumping up and looking out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he only saw the broad bleak sunshiny plainthat is at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but by and by in the circle of mud that surrounded the base of the tower he perceived distinctly the marks of a horses feet and just in the spot where the deafmute was accustomed to tie up his great black charger while he himself ascended there lay the remains of a bundle of hay and a feed of corn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has come and gone taking nurse away with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while she was coiling her rope he was making halfhearted buck jumps across the corral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she swished the rope through the air to widen her loop he reared and whirled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she jabbed him smartly with the spurs and he kicked forward at her feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say she drawled to burns i dont know what sort of a picture youre going to make but if you want any roping done from this horse youll have to furnish meals and beds for your audiences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with that she was off across the corral at a tearing pace that made the watchers gasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came near going down in a heap but recovered himself after scrambling along on his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jean brought him to a stand before burns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill have to ask you to raise your price mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns if you want me to run this animal down the bluff she stated firmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes just what i thought he was all along a ridearoundtheblock horse from some livery stable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it comes to range work he doesnt know as much as some people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you be willing to let me have the use of himat so much per <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now since youre here and dont seem as busy as you thought you were ill show you the difference between this liverystable beast and a real ropehorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dismounted and called to pard and pard came to her stepping warily because of the sorrel and the rope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just to save time will one of you boys go and bring my riding outfit from the stable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked the line at the fence whereupon the leading man and all the villains started unanimously to perform that slight service which shows pretty well how jean stood in their estimation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now thats a real typical liverystable saddle and bridle she observed to burns pointing scornfully at the sorrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was going to tell you that id hate to be seen in a picture riding that outfit anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you watch how differently pard behaves with a rope and everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you watch the sorrel get whats coming to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns in his eagerness began to climb the corral fenceuntil he heard a rail crack under his weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you can rope and throw that sorrel jean did not reply to that halffinished sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was busy saddling pard now she mounted and widened her loop with a sureness of the result that flashed a thrill of expectation to her audience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice the loop circled over her head before she flipped it out straight and true toward the frantic sorrel as he surged by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she caught him fairly by both front feet and swung pard half away from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pards muscles stiffened against the jerk of the rope and the sorrel went down with a bump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pard backed knowingly and braced himself like the trained ropehorse he was and jean looked at robert grant burns and laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she touched pard with her heel and rode up so that the rope slackened and she could throw off the loop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could have gotten off and gone clear away and pard would have kept that horse from getting on his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pard never would have gone down like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh youll do chuckled robert grant burns ill pay you a little more and use you and your horse together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when lite objected to her staying altogether at the lazy a jean assured him that she was being terribly practical and cautious and businesslike and pointed out to him that staying there would save pard and herself the trip back and forth each day and would give her time mornings and evenings to work on her book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lite of course knew all about that soontobefamous book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he usually did know nearly everything that concerned jean or held her interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether after three years of futile attempts lite still felt himself entitled to be called jeans boss i cannot say for a certainty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had grown rather silent upon that subject and rather inclined to keep himself in the background as jean grew older and more determined in her ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but certainly he was jeans one confidential friend her pal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so lite perforce listened while jean told him the plot of her story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she asked him in all earnestness what he thought would be best for the tragic element ghosts or indians lite meditated gravely upon the subject and then suggested that she put in both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is why jean lavishly indulged in mysterious footsteps all through the first chapter and then opened the second with bloodcurdling warwhoops that chilled the soul of her heroine and led her to suspect that the rocks behind the cabin concealed the forms of painted savages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her imagination must have been stimulated by her new work which called for wild rides after posses and wilder flights away from the outlaws while the flash of blank cartridges and the smokepots of disaster by fire added their spectacular effect to a scene now and then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jean of course was invariably the wild rider who fled in a blond wig and muriels clothes from pursuing villains or dashed up to the sheriffs office to give the alarm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frequently she fired the blank cartridges until lite warned her that blank cartridges would ruin her gunbarrel after which she insisted upon using bullets to the secret trepidation of the villains who must stand before her and who could never quite grasp the fact that jean knew exactly where those bullets were going to land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would sit in her room at the lazy a when the sun and the big black automobile and the painted workers were gone and write feverishly of ghosts and indians and the fair maiden who endured so much and the brave hero who dared so much and loved so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lee milligan she visualized as the human wolf who looked with desire upon lillian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gil huntley became the hero as the story unfolded and while i have told you absolutely nothing about jeans growing acquaintance with these two you may draw your own conclusions from the place she made for them in her book that she was writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you may also form some idea of what lite avery was living through during those days when his work and his pride held him apart and jean did stunts to her hearts content with these others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a letter from the higherups in the great western company written just after a trial run of the first picture wherein jean had worked had served to stimulate burns appetite for the spectacular so that the stunts became more and more the features of his pictures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> muriel gay was likely to become the most famous photo play actress in the west he believed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is she would if jean continued to double for her in everything save the straight dramatic work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jean did not care just at that time how much glory muriel gay was collecting for work that jean herself had done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she assured me however that she would release me if they did not come too soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we heard them coming down the trench and i bade mary hide in a corner lest she be discovered and punished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was naught else she could do and so she crawled away into the stygian blackness behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the leader exhibited a unique method of discovering my whereabouts in the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he advanced slowly kicking out viciously before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later i had been jerked roughly to my feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the fellows stopped and severed the bonds that held my ankles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two pulled and hauled me through the low doorway and along the trench <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a party of forty or fifty warriors were awaiting us at the brink of the excavation some hundred yards from the hut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hands were lowered to us and we were dragged to the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stumbled through the underbrush wet with dew our way lighted by a score of torchbearers who surrounded us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the torches were not to light the waythat was but incidental <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were carried to keep off the huge carnivora that moaned and coughed and roared about us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yellowgreen eyes blazed wickedly at us from out the surrounding darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these they kept ever pointed toward the beast of prey and i learned from snatches of the conversation i overheard that occasionally there might be a lion who would brave even the terrors of fire to leap in upon human prey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was for such that the spears were always couched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but nothing of the sort occurred during this hideous death march and with the first pale heralding of dawn we reached our goalan open place in the midst of a tangled wildwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here rose in crumbling grandeur the first evidences i had seen of the ancient civilization which once had graced fair albiona single timeworn arch of masonry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the entrance to the camp of the lions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> murmured one of the party in a voice husky with awe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the party knelt while buckingham recited a weird prayerlike chant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was rather long and i recall only a portion of it which ran if my memory serves me somewhat lord of grabritin we fall on our knees to thee this gift to bring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the party rose and dragging me to the crumbling arch made me fast to a huge corroded copper ring which was dangling from an eyebolt imbedded in the masonry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of them not even buckingham seemed to feel any personal animosity toward me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were naturally rough and brutal as primitive men are supposed to have been since the dawn of humanity but they did not go out of their way to maltreat me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the coming of dawn the number of lions about us seemed to have greatly diminishedat least they made less noise and as buckingham and his party disappeared into the woods leaving me alone to my terrible fate i could hear the grumblings and growlings of the beasts diminishing with the sound of the chant which the party still continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeared that the lions had failed to note that i had been left for their breakfast and had followed off after their worshippers instead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i knew the reprieve would be but for a short time and though i had no wish to die i must confess that i rather wished the ordeal over and the peace of oblivion upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the voices of the men and the lions receded in the distance until finally quiet reigned about me broken only by the sweet voices of birds and the sighing of the summer wind in the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why there was a buck i had shot in hogley woods a magnificent pricket and do you know how she had it sent up to table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however it is no matter now for it is all over and i dont think it was very nice of her brothers to starve me to death starve you to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ghost i mean sir simon are you no thank you i never eat anything now but it is very kind of you all the same and you are much nicer than the rest of your stop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried virginia stamping her foot it is you who are rude and horrid and vulgar and as for dishonesty you know you stole the paints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous bloodstain in the library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first you took all my reds including the vermilion and i couldnt do any more sunsets then you took the emeraldgreen and the chromeyellow and finally i had nothing left but indigo and chinese white and could only do moonlight scenes which are always depressing to look at and not at all easy to paint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never told on you though i was very much annoyed and it was most ridiculous the whole thing for who ever heard of well really said the ghost rather meekly what was i to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays and as your brother began it all with his paragon detergent i certainly saw no reason why i should not have your paints <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for colour that is always a matter of taste the cantervilles have blue blood for instance the very bluest in england but i know you you know nothing about it and the best thing you can do is to emigrate and improve your mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father will be only too happy to give you a free passage and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind there will be no difficulty about the custom house as the officers are all democrats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once in new york you are sure to be a great success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to have a grandfather and i suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities said virginia satirically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answered the ghost you have your navy good evening i will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra please dont go miss virginia he cried i am so lonely and so unhappy and i really dont know what to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to go to sleep thats quite absurd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have merely to go to bed and blow out the candle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very difficult sometimes to keep awake especially at church but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why even babies know how to do that and they are not i have not slept for three hundred years he said sadly and virginias beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder for three hundred virginia grew quite grave and her little lips trembled like rose leaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she came towards him and kneeling down at his side looked up into his old withered face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor poor ghost she murmured have you no place where you can far away beyond the pinewoods he answered in a low dreamy voice there is a little garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there the grass grows long and deep there are the great white stars of the hemlock flower there the nightingale sings all night long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all night long he sings and the cold crystal moon looks down and the yewtree spreads out its virginias eyes grew dim with tears and she hid her face in her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he never could forget what he had been and he knew that he had once disliked gowan for no better reason than that he had come in his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harassed by these thoughts he now began to wish the marriage over gowan and his young wife gone and himself left to fulfil his promise and discharge the generous function he had accepted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this last week was in truth an uneasy interval for the whole house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before pet or before gowan mr meagles was radiant but clennam had more than once found him alone with his view of the scales and scoop much blurred and had often seen him look after the lovers in the garden or elsewhere when he was not seen by them with the old clouded face on which gowan had fallen like a shadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the arrangement of the house for the great occasion many little reminders of the old travels of the father and mother and daughter had to be disturbed and passed from hand to hand and sometimes in the midst of these mute witnesses to the life they had had together even pet herself would yield to lamenting and weeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs meagles the blithest and busiest of mothers went about singing and cheering everybody but she honest soul had her flights into store rooms where she would cry until her eyes were red and would then come out attributing that appearance to pickled onions and pepper and singing clearer than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs tickit finding no balsam for a wounded mind in buchans domestic medicine suffered greatly from low spirits and from moving recollections of minnies infancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the latter was powerful with her she usually sent up secret messages importing that she was not in parlour condition as to her attire and that she solicited a sight of her child in the kitchen there she would bless her childs face and bless her childs heart and hug her child in a medley of tears and congratulations choppingboards rollingpins and piecrust with the tenderness of an old attached servant which is a very pretty tenderness indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but all days come that are to be and the marriageday was to be and it came and with it came all the barnacles who were bidden to the feast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was mr tite barnacle from the circumlocution office and mews street grosvenor square with the expensive mrs tite barnacle nee stiltstalking who made the quarter days so long in coming and the three expensive miss tite barnacles doubleloaded with accomplishments and ready to go off and yet not going off with the sharpness of flash and bang that might have been expected but rather hanging fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was barnacle junior also from the circumlocution office leaving the tonnage of the country which he was somehow supposed to take under his protection to look after itself and sooth to say not at all impairing the efficiency of its protection by leaving it alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the engaging young barnacle deriving from the sprightly side of the family also from the circumlocution office gaily and agreeably helping the occasion along and treating it in his sparkling way as one of the official forms and fees of the church department of how not to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were three other young barnacles from three other offices insipid to all the senses and terribly in want of seasoning doing the marriage as they would have done the nile old rome the new singer or jerusalem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was lord decimus tite barnacle himself in the odour of circumlocutionwith the very smell of despatchboxes upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes there was lord decimus tite barnacle who had risen to official heights on the wings of one indignant idea and that was my lords that i am yet to be told that it behoves a minister of this free country to set bounds to the philanthropy to cramp the charity to fetter the public spirit to contract the enterprise to damp the independent self reliance of its people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was in other words that this great statesman was always yet to be told that it behoved the pilot of the ship to do anything but prosper in the private loaf and fish trade ashore the crew being able by dint of hard pumping to keep the ship above water without him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this sublime discovery in the great art how not to do it lord decimus had long sustained the highest glory of the barnacle family and let any illadvised member of either house but try how to do it by bringing in a bill to do it that bill was as good as dead and buried when lord decimus tite barnacle rose up in his place and solemnly said soaring into indignant majesty as the circumlocution cheering soared around him that he was yet to be told my lords that it behoved him as the minister of this free country to set bounds to the philanthropy to cramp the charity to fetter the public spirit to contract the enterprise to damp the independent self reliance of its people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the discovery of this behoving machine was the discovery of the political perpetual motion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it never wore out though it was always going round and round in all the state departments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there with his noble friend and relative lord decimus was william barnacle who had made the everfamous coalition with tudor stiltstalking and who always kept ready his own particular recipe for how not to do it sometimes tapping the speaker and drawing it fresh out of him with a first i will beg you sir to inform the house what precedent we have for the course into which the honourable gentleman would precipitate us sometimes asking the honourable gentleman to favour him with his own version of the precedent sometimes telling the honourable gentleman that he william barnacle would search for a precedent and oftentimes crushing the honourable gentleman flat on the spot by telling him there was no precedent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but precedent and precipitate were under all circumstances the wellmatched pair of battlehorses of this able circumlocutionist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no matter that the unhappy honourable gentleman had been trying in vain for twentyfive years to precipitate william barnacle into thiswilliam barnacle still put it to the house and at secondhand or so to the country whether he was to be precipitated into this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no matter that it was utterly irreconcilable with the nature of things and course of events that the wretched honourable gentleman could possibly produce a precedent for thiswilliam barnacle would nevertheless thank the honourable gentleman for that ironical cheer and would close with him upon that issue and would tell him to his teeth that there was no precedent for this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might perhaps have been objected that the william barnacle wisdom was not high wisdom or the earth it bamboozled would never have been made or if made in a rash mistake would have remained blank mud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but precedent and precipitate together frightened all objection out of most people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there too was another barnacle a lively one who had leaped through twenty places in quick succession and was always in two or three at once and who was the muchrespected inventor of an art which he practised with great success and admiration in all barnacle governments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was when he was asked a parliamentary question on any one topic to return an answer on any other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had done immense service and brought him into high esteem with the circumlocution office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there too was a sprinkling of less distinguished parliamentary barnacles who had not as yet got anything snug and were going through their probation to prove their worthiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these barnacles perched upon staircases and hid in passages waiting their orders to make houses or not to make houses and they did all their hearing and ohing and cheering and barking under directions from the heads of the family and they put dummy motions on the paper in the way of other mens motions and they stalled disagreeable subjects off until late in the night and late in the session and then with virtuous patriotism cried out that it was too late and they went down into the country whenever they were sent and swore that lord decimus had revived trade from a swoon and commerce from a fit and had doubled the harvest of corn quadrupled the harvest of hay and prevented no end of gold from flying out of the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also these barnacles were dealt by the heads of the family like so many cards below the courtcards to public meetings and dinners where they bore testimony to all sorts of services on the part of their noble and honourable relatives and buttered the barnacles on all sorts of toasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they stood under similar orders at all sorts of elections and they turned out of their own seats on the shortest notice and the most unreasonable terms to let in other men and they fetched and carried and toadied and jobbed and corrupted and ate heaps of dirt and were indefatigable in the public service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there was not a list in all the circumlocution office of places that might fall vacant anywhere within half a century from a lord of the treasury to a chinese consul and up again to a governorgeneral of india but as applicants for such places the names of some or of every one of these hungry and adhesive barnacles were down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was necessarily but a sprinkling of any class of barnacles that attended the marriage for there were not two score in all and what is that subtracted from legion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the sprinkling was a swarm in the twickenham cottage and filled it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a barnacle assisted by a barnacle married the happy pair and it behoved lord decimus tite barnacle himself to conduct mrs meagles to breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the entertainment was not as agreeable and natural as it might have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr meagles hove down by his good company while he highly appreciated it was not himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs gowan was herself and that did not improve him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fiction that it was not mr meagles who had stood in the way but that it was the family greatness and that the family greatness had made a concession and there was now a soothing unanimity pervaded the affair though it was never openly expressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the barnacles felt that they for their parts would have done with the meagleses when the present patronising occasion was over and the meagleses felt the same for their parts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then gowan asserting his rights as a disappointed man who had his grudge against the family and who perhaps had allowed his mother to have them there as much in the hope it might give them some annoyance as with any other benevolent object aired his pencil and his poverty ostentatiously before them and told them he hoped in time to settle a crust of bread and cheese on his wife and that he begged such of them as more fortunate than himself came in for any good thing and could buy a picture to please to remember the poor painter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then lord decimus who was a wonder on his own parliamentary pedestal turned out to be the windiest creature here proposing happiness to the bride and bridegroom in a series of platitudes that would have made the hair of any sincere disciple and believer stand on end and trotting with the complacency of an idiotic elephant among howling labyrinths of sentences which he seemed to take for high roads and never so much as wanted to get out of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then mr tite barnacle could not but feel that there was a person in company who would have disturbed his lifelong sitting to sir thomas lawrence in full official character if such disturbance had been possible while barnacle junior did with indignation communicate to two vapid gentlemen his relatives that there was a feller here look here who had come to our department without an appointment and said he wanted to know you know and that look here if he was to break out now as he might you know for you never could tell what an ungentlemanly radical of that sort would be up to next and was to say look here that he wanted to know this moment you know that would be jolly wouldnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pleasantest part of the occasion by far to clennam was the painfullest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when mr and mrs meagles at last hung about pet in the room with the two pictures where the company were not before going with her to the threshold which she could never recross to be the old pet and the old delight nothing could be more natural and simple than the three were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gowan himself was touched and answered mr meagless o gowan take care of her take care of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with an earnest dont be so brokenhearted sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by heaven and so with the last sobs and last loving words and a last look to clennam of confidence in his promise pet fell back in the carriage and her husband waved his hand and they were away for dover though not until the faithful mrs tickit in her silk gown and jet black curls had rushed out from some hidingplace and thrown both her shoes after the carriage an apparition which occasioned great surprise to the distinguished company at the windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the said company being now relieved from further attendance and the chief barnacles being rather hurried for they had it in hand just then to send a mail or two which was in danger of going straight to its destination beating about the seas like the flying dutchman and to arrange with complexity for the stoppage of a good deal of important business otherwise in peril of being done went their several ways with all affability conveying to mr and mrs meagles that general assurance that what they had been doing there they had been doing at a sacrifice for mr and mrs meagless good which they always conveyed to mr john bull in their official condescension to that most unfortunate creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a miserable blank remained in the house and in the hearts of the father and mother and clennam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr meagles called only one remembrance to his aid that really did him good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its very gratifying arthur he said after all to look back the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had made him much more low and unhappy at the time but now it really did him good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its very gratifying he said often repeating the remark in the course of the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such high it was at this time that mr pancks in discharge of his compact with clennam revealed to him the whole of his gipsy story and told him little dorrits fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her father was heiratlaw to a great estate that had long lain unknown of unclaimed and accumulating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his right was now clear nothing interposed in his way the marshalsea gates stood open the marshalsea walls were down a few flourishes of his pen and he was extremely rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his tracking out of the claim to its complete establishment mr pancks had shown a sagacity that nothing could baffle and a patience and secrecy that nothing could tire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i little thought sir said pancks when you and i crossed smithfield that night and i told you what sort of a collector i was that this would come of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i little thought sir when i told you you were not of the clennams of cornwall that i was ever going to tell you who were of the dorrits of dorsetshire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how having that name recorded in his notebook he was first attracted by the name alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how having often found two exactly similar names even belonging to the same place to involve no traceable consanguinity near or distant he did not at first give much heed to this except in the way of speculation as to what a surprising change would be made in the condition of a little seamstress if she could be shown to have any interest in so large a property <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he rather supposed himself to have pursued the idea into its next degree because there was something uncommon in the quiet little seamstress which pleased him and provoked his curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he had felt his way inch by inch and moled it out sir that was mr panckss expression grain by grain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how in the beginning of the labour described by this new verb and to render which the more expressive mr pancks shut his eyes in pronouncing it and shook his hair over them he had alternated from sudden lights and hopes to sudden darkness and no hopes and back again and back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he had made acquaintances in the prison expressly that he might come and go there as all other comers and goers did and how his first ray of light was unconsciously given him by mr dorrit himself and by his son to both of whom he easily became known with both of whom he talked much casually but always moleing youll observe said mr pancks and from whom he derived without being at all suspected two or three little points of family history which as he began to hold clues of his own suggested others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how it had at length become plain to mr pancks that he had made a real discovery of the heiratlaw to a great fortune and that his discovery had but to be ripened to legal fulness and perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he had thereupon sworn his landlord mr rugg to secrecy in a solemn manner and taken him into moleing partnership <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how they had employed john chivery as their sole clerk and agent seeing to whom he was devoted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how until the present hour when authorities mighty in the bank and learned in the law declared their successful labours ended they had confided in no other human being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so if the whole thing had broken down sir concluded pancks at the very last say the day before the other day when i showed you our papers in the prison yard or say that very day nobody but ourselves would have been cruelly disappointed or a penny the clennam who had been almost incessantly shaking hands with him throughout the narrative was reminded by this to say in an amazement which even the preparation he had had for the main disclosure smoothed down my dear mr pancks this must have cost pretty well sir said the triumphant pancks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no trifle though we did it as cheap as it could be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the difficulties you have so wonderfully conquered in the whole business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill tell you how i did it said the delighted pancks putting his hair into a condition as elevated as himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first i spent i am sorry for it said clennam not that it matters now noble old boy ant he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said mr pancks entering on a series of the dryest snorts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we never do business for less at our arthur felt an awkward consciousness of having in his exultant condition been a little premature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said to that boilingover old christian mr pancks pursued appearing greatly to relish this descriptive epithet that i had got a little project on hand a hopeful one i told him a hopeful one which wanted a certain small capital <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i proposed to him to lend me the money on my note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which he did at twenty sticking the twenty on in a businesslike way and putting it into the note to look like a part of the principal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had broken down after that i should have been his grubber for the next seven years at half wages and double grind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but hes a perfect patriarch and it arthur for his life could not have said with confidence whether pancks really thought so or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when that was gone sir resumed pancks and it did go though i dribbled it out like so much blood i had taken mr rugg into the secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i proposed to borrow of mr rugg or of miss rugg its the same thing she made a little money by a speculation in the common pleas once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lent it at ten and thought that pretty high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mr ruggs a redhaired man sir and gets his hair cut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as to the crown of his hat its high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as to the brim of his hat its narrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and theres no more benevolence bubbling out of him your own recompense for all this mr pancks said clennam ought i dont mistrust getting it sir said pancks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i owed you one on that score now i have paid it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> money out of pocket made good time fairly allowed for and mr ruggs bill settled a thousand pounds would be a fortune to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i authorize you now to break all this to the family in any way you think best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss amy dorrit will be with mrs finching this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this conversation took place in clennams bedroom while he was yet in bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for mr pancks had knocked up the house and made his way in very early in the morning and without once sitting down or standing still had delivered himself of the whole of his details illustrated with a variety of documents at the bedside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he now said he would go and look up mr rugg from whom his excited state of mind appeared to require another back and bundling up his papers and exchanging one more hearty shake of the hand with clennam he went at full speed downstairs and steamed off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clennam of course resolved to go direct to mr casbys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dressed and got out so quickly that he found himself at the corner of the patriarchal street nearly an hour before her time but he was not sorry to have the opportunity of calming himself with a leisurely walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he returned to the street and had knocked at the bright brass knocker he was informed that she had come and was shown upstairs to floras breakfastroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little dorrit was not there herself but flora was and testified the greatest amazement at seeing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried that lady who would have ever thought of seeing such a sight as this and pray excuse a wrapper for upon my word i really never and a faded check too which is worse but our little friend is making me a not that i need mind mentioning it to you for you must know that there are such things a skirt and having arranged that a trying on should take place after breakfast is the reason though i wish not so badly i ought to make an apology said arthur for so early and abrupt in times for ever fled arthur returned mrs finching pray excuse me doyce and clennam infinitely more correct and though unquestionably distant still tis distance lends enchantment to the view at least i dont mean that and if i did i suppose it would depend considerably on the nature of the view but im running on in times for ever fled i was going to say it would have sounded strange indeed for arthur clennamdoyce and clennam naturally quite differentto make apologies for coming here at any time but that is past and what is past can never be recalled except in his own case as poor mr f <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said when he was in spirits cucumber and she was making the tea when arthur came in and now hastily finished that operation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> papa she said all mystery and whisper as she shut down the teapot lid is sitting prosingly breaking his new laid egg in the back parlour over the city article exactly like the woodpecker tapping and need never know that you are here and our little friend you are well aware may be fully trusted when she comes down arthur then told her in the fewest words that it was their little friend he came to see and what he had to announce to their little friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at which astounding intelligence flora clasped her hands fell into a tremble and shed tears of sympathy and pleasure like the goodnatured creature she really was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for goodness sake let me get out of the way first said flora putting her hands to her ears and moving towards the door or i know i shall go off dead and screaming and make everybody worse and the dear little thing only this morning looking so nice and neat and good and yet so poor and now a fortune is she really and deserves it too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and might i mention it to mr f.s aunt arthur not doyce and clennam for this once or if objectionable not on any arthur nodded his free permission since flora shut out all verbal communication <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flora nodded in return to thank him and hurried out of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little dorrits step was already on the stairs and in another moment she was at the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do what he could to compose his face he could not convey so much of an ordinary expression into it but that the moment she saw it she dropped her work and cried mr nothing nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have come to tell you something but it is a piece of great good fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stood in a window and her eyes full of light were fixed upon his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put an arm about her seeing her likely to sink down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put a hand upon that arm partly to rest upon it and partly so to preserve their relative positions as that her intent look at him should be shaken by no change of attitude in either of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ice of the pale face broke at the word and little lights and shoots of expression passed all over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have clasped the little figure closer but he saw that the eyes appealed to him not to be moved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father can be free within this week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he does not know it we must go to him from here to tell him of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father will be free within a few days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father will be free within a few that brought her back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes were closing but they opened again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is not all the wonderful your father will be no beggar when he is free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knows nothing of she seemed to entreat him for a little time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held her in his arm and after a pause bent down his ear to listen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great sum of money is waiting to be paid over to him as his inheritance you are all henceforth very wealthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bravest and best of children i thank as he kissed her she turned her head towards his shoulder and raised her arm towards his neck cried out father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon which flora returned to take care of her and hovered about her on a sofa intermingling kind offices and incoherent scraps of conversation in a manner so confounding that whether she pressed the marshalsea to take a spoonful of unclaimed dividends for it would do her good or whether she congratulated little dorrits father on coming into possession of a hundred thousand smelling bottles or whether she explained that she put seventyfive thousand drops of spirits of lavender on fifty thousand pounds of lump sugar and that she entreated little dorrit to take that gentle restorative or whether she bathed the foreheads of doyce and clennam in vinegar and gave the late mr f <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more air no one with any sense of responsibility could have undertaken to decide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a tributary stream of confusion moreover poured in from an adjoining bedroom where mr f.s aunt appeared from the sound of her voice to be in a horizontal posture awaiting her breakfast and from which bower that inexorable lady snapped off short taunts whenever she could get a hearing as dont believe its his doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he neednt take no credit to himself for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and itll be long enough i expect afore hell give up any of his own money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all designed to disparage clennams share in the discovery and to relieve those inveterate feelings with which mr f.s aunt regarded him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but little dorrits solicitude to get to her father and to carry the joyful tidings to him and not to leave him in his jail a moment with this happiness in store for him and still unknown to him did more for her speedy restoration than all the skill and attention on earth could have done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spoke of nothing but him thought of nothing but him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kneeling down and pouring out her thankfulness with uplifted hands her thanks were for her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> floras tenderness was quite overcome by this and she launched out among the cups and saucers into a wonderful flow of tears and speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i declare she sobbed i never was so cut up since your mama and my papa not doyce and clennam for this once but give the precious little thing a cup of tea and make her put it to her lips at least pray arthur do not even mr f.s last illness for that was of another kind and gout is not a childs affection though very painful for all parties and mr f <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a martyr with his leg upon a rest and the wine trade in itself inflammatory for they will do it more or less among themselves and who can wonder it seems like a dream i am sure to think of nothing at all this morning and now mines of money is it really but you must know my darling love because you never will be strong enough to tell him all about it upon teaspoons mightnt it be even best to try the directions of my own medical man for though the flavour is anything but agreeable still i force myself to do it as a prescription and find the benefit youd rather not why no my dear id rather not but still i do it as a duty everybody will congratulate you some in earnest and some not and many will congratulate you with all their hearts but none more so i do assure you from the bottom of my own i do myself though sensible of blundering and being stupid and will be judged by arthur not doyce and clennam for this once so goodbye darling and god bless you and may you be very happy and excuse the liberty vowing that the dress shall never be finished by anybody else but shall be laid by for a keepsake just as it is and called little dorrit though why that strangest of denominations at any time i thus flora in taking leave of her favourite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little dorrit thanked her and embraced her over and over again and finally came out of the house with clennam and took coach for the marshalsea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a strangely unreal ride through the old squalid streets with a sensation of being raised out of them into an airy world of wealth and grandeur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when arthur told her that she would soon ride in her own carriage through very different scenes when all the familiar experiences would have vanished away she looked frightened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when he substituted her father for herself and told her how he would ride in his carriage and how great and grand he would be her tears of joy and innocent pride fell fast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing that the happiness her mind could realise was all shining upon him arthur kept that single figure before her and so they rode brightly through the poor streets in the prison neighbourhood to carry him the great news <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when mr chivery who was on duty admitted them into the lodge he saw something in their faces which filled him with astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood looking after them when they hurried into the prison as though he perceived that they had come back accompanied by a ghost apiece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two or three collegians whom they passed looked after them too and presently joining mr chivery formed a little group on the lodge steps in the midst of which there spontaneously originated a whisper that the father was going to get his discharge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within a few minutes it was heard in the remotest room in the college <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little dorrit opened the door from without and they both entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sitting in his old grey gown and his old black cap in the sunlight by the window reading his newspaper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his glasses were in his hand and he had just looked round surprised at first no doubt by her step upon the stairs not expecting her until night surprised again by seeing arthur clennam in her company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they came in the same unwonted look in both of them which had already caught attention in the yard below struck him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not rise or speak but laid down his glasses and his newspaper on the table beside him and looked at them with his mouth a little open and his lips trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when arthur put out his hand he touched it but not with his usual state and then he turned to his daughter who had sat down close beside him with her hands upon his shoulder and looked attentively in her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he brought me such joyful and wonderful intelligence about you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had not with his great kindness and gentleness prepared me for it fatherprepared me for it her agitation was exceedingly great and the tears rolled down her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put his hand suddenly to his heart and looked at clennam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> compose yourself sir said clennam and take a little time to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to think of the brightest and most fortunate accidents of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have all heard of great surprises of joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not at an end for he touched no returned clennam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what surprise he asked keeping his left hand over his heart and there stopping in his speech while with his right hand he put his glasses exactly level on the table what such surprise can be let me answer with another question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me mr dorrit what surprise would be the most unlooked for and the most acceptable to he looked steadfastly at clennam and so looking at him seemed to change into a very old haggard man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was bright upon the wall beyond the window and on the spikes at top <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slowly stretched out the hand that had been upon his heart and pointed at the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remained in the same attitude looking steadfastly at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in its place said clennam slowly and distinctly are the means to possess and enjoy the utmost that they have so long shut out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr dorrit there is not the smallest doubt that within a few days you will be free and highly prosperous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i congratulate you with all my soul on this change of fortune and on the happy future into which you are soon to carry the treasure you have been blest with herethe best of all the riches you can have elsewherethe with those words he pressed his hand and released it and his daughter laying her face against his encircled him in the hour of his prosperity with her arms as she had in the long years of his adversity encircled him with her love and toil and truth and poured out her full heart in gratitude hope joy blissful ecstasy and all for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall see him as i never saw him yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall see my dear love with the dark cloud cleared away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall see him as my poor mother saw him long ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he yielded himself to her kisses and caresses but did not return them except that he put an arm about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his steadfast look was now divided between her and clennam and he began to shake as if he were very cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> explaining to little dorrit that he would run to the coffeehouse for a bottle of wine arthur fetched it with all the haste he could use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while it was being brought from the cellar to the bar a number of excited people asked him what had happened when he hurriedly informed them that mr dorrit had succeeded to a fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on coming back with the wine in his hand he found that she had placed her father in his easy chair and had loosened his shirt and neckcloth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they filled a tumbler with wine and held it to his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had swallowed a little he took the glass himself and emptied it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon after that he leaned back in his chair and cried with his handkerchief before his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we have to be careful not to offend them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss hinkles tone in the last remark was so significant that susan looked at herand looking understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes pursued miss hinkle eyes carefully averted sometimes a new girl goes out with an important customer and he gets fresh and she kicks and complains to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they always sympathize with herbutwell ive noticed that somehow she soon loses her job <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you do whenwhen a customer annoys you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a swift glance of the cynical laughing fast eyes at susan and away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the best i canfor the houseand for myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i talk to you because i know youre a lady and because i dont want to see you thrown down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a woman thats living quietly at homelike a ladyshe can be squeamish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but out in the world a woman cant afford to beno nor a man neither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont find this set down in the books and they dont preach it in the churchesleastways they didnt when i used to go to church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were a few minutes early so miss hinkle continued the conversation while they waited for the opening of the room where susan would be outfitted for her work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i called you miss sackville said she but youve been marriedhavent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can always tellor at least i can see whether a womans had experience or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ive never been regularly married and i dont expect to unless something pretty good offers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think id marry one of these rotten little clerks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss hinkle answered her own question with a scornful sniff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they can hardly make a living for themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a man who amounts to anything he wants a refined lady to help him on up not a working girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as a rule a girl in our position either has to stay single or marry beneath hermarry some mechanic or such like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i aint so lazy or so crazy about being supported that id sink to be cook and slopcarrierand worsefor a carpenter or a bricklayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> going out with the buyersthe gentlemanly oneshas spoiled my taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant stand a coarse mancoarse dress and hands and manners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan turned hastily away so that her face was hidden from miss hinkle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill bet you wasnt married to a coarse man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id rather not talk about myself said susan with an effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her manner of checking miss hinkles friendly curiosity did not give offense it excited the experienced working womans well i feel sorry for any woman that has to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course most women doand at worse than anything in the stores and factories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as between being a drudge to some dirty common laborer like most women are and working in a factory even give me the factory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes give me a job as a pot slinger even low as that is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up to murrays last night i sat there eating my lobster and drinking my wine and i pretended i was a ladyand my how happy i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan with the help of miss hinkle and the stock keeper dressed in one of the tightfitting satin slips that revealed every curve and line of her form made every motion however slight every breath she drew a gesture of sensuousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she looked at herself in a long glass in one of the showparlors her face did not reflect the admiration frankly displayed upon the faces of the two other women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that satin slip seemed to have a moral quality an immoral character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made her feel nakedno as if she were naked and being peeped at through a crack or keyhole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll soon get used to it miss hinkle assured her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youll learn to show off the dresses and cloaks to the best advantage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughed her insinuating little laugh again amused cynical reckless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gee what awful jay things we work off on them sometimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they cant see the dress for the figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youve got such a refined figure miss sackvillethe kind id be crazy about if i was a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i must say here she eyed herself in the glass complacentlymost men prefer a figure like mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stock keeper shook her fat shoulders in a gesture of indifferent disdain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was making the rounds of the big wholesale houses in search of stock for the huge chicago department store that paid him fifteen thousand a year and expenses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been contemptuous of the offerings of jeffries and jonas for the winter season had praised with enthusiasm the models of their principal rival icklemeier schwartz and company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were undecided whether he was really thinking of deserting them or was feeling for lower prices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jeffries bustled into the room where susan stood waiting his flat face quivered with excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he himself assisted while they tricked out susan in an afternoon costume of pale gray putting on her head a big pale gray hat with harmonizing feathers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the model was offered in all colors and also in a modified form that permitted its use for either afternoon or evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan had received her instructions so when she was dressed she was ready to sweep into gideons presence with languid majesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jeffries eyes glistened as he noted her walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looks as if she really was a lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could make my daughters move around on their trotters like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gideon was enthroned in an easy chair smoking a cigar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a spare man of perhaps fortyfive with no intention of abandoning the pretensions to youth for many a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in dress he was as spick and span as a tailor at the trades annual convention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had evidently been going some for several days the sour worn haggard face rising above his elegantly fitting collar suggested a motheaten jaguar that has been for weeks on short rations or none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he snapped as the door began to open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in swept susan and jeffries rubbing his thick hands said fawningly but i think mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gideon youll say it was worth waiting for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gideons angry arrogant eyes softened at first glimpse of susan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he grunted some such sound as the jaguar aforesaid would make when the first chunk of food hurtled through the bars and landed on his paws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat with cigar poised between his long white fingers while susan walked up and down before him displaying the dress at all angles jeffries expatiating upon it the while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he commanded with the insolence of a customer containing possibilities of large profit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should say not cried jeffries laughing the merchants laugh for a customers pleasantry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i cant help talking about it gid its so lovely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jeffries shrewd eyes leaped for joy when gideon got up from his chair and under pretense of examining the garment investigated susans figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as his gentle insinuating hands traveled over her his eyes sought hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill see that they get the other things ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and out he went winking at mary hinkle to follow himan unnecessary gesture as she was already on her way to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gideon understood as well as did they why they left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think ive seen you before my dear said he to susan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like to know everybody i deal with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got the best figure in the businessthe very best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you said susan with a grave distant smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired he and assuming that everything would yield precedence to him he did not wait for a reply but went on tell me your address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill send a cab for you at seven oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you said susan but i cant go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are reasons why id rather not be seen in the restaurants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill come in the cab myself and well go to a quiet place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that she looked at him more carefully he was unusually attractive for a man of his typehad strength and intelligence in his features had a suggestion of mastery of one used to obedience in his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his teeth were even and sound his lips firm yet not too thin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill not eat you up with a gay and gracious smileat least ill try not to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan remembered what miss hinkle had told her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw that she must either accept the invitation or give up her position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> back came jeffries and miss hinkle carrying the first of the wraps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve shown em to me before said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan withdrew soon to appear in a dress that left her arms and neck bare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jeffries kept her walking up and down until she was ready to drop with weariness of the monotony of the distasteful play of gideons fiery glance upon her arms and shoulders and throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gideon tried to draw her into conversation but she wouldindeed couldgo no further than direct answers to his direct questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never mind said he to her in an undertone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i know how to order a dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her instant conquest of the difficult and valuable gideon so elated jeffries that he piled the work on her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he used her with every important buyer who came that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the temperature was up in the high nineties the hot moist air stood stagnant as a barnyard pool the winter models were cruelly hot and heavy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all day long with a pause of half an hour to eat her roll and drink a glass of water susan walked up and down the show parlors weighted with dresses and cloaks furs for arctic weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other girls even those doing almost nothing were all but prostrated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was little short of intolerable this struggle to gain the honest selfrespecting living by honest work that there was so much talk about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toward five oclock her nerves abruptly and completely gave way and she faintedfor the first time in her life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once the whole establishment was in an uproar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jeffries cursed himself loudly for his shortsightedness for his overestimating her young strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shell look like hell this evening he wailed wringing his hands like a distracted peasant woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe she wont be able to go out at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they brought her whiskey and afterward tea and sandwiches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with the power of quick recuperation that is the most fascinating miracle of healthy youth she not only showed no sign of her breakdown but looked much better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall some day understand why it is that if a severe physical blow follows upon a mental blow recovery from the physical blow is always accompanied by a relief of the mental strain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan came out of her fit of faintness and exhaustion with a different point of viewas if time had been long at work softening her grief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> spenser seemed part of the present no longer but of the pasta past far more remote than yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary hinkle sat with her as she drank the tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her tone let susan know that the question had been prompted by jeffries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked me to dine with him and i said i would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you got a nice dressdinner dress i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then ill give you one out of stocki mean ill borrow one for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this dinners a house affair you knowto get gids order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there wouldnt be anything to fit me on such short notice said susan casting about for an excuse for not wearing borrowed finery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill pick you out a white dressand a black and white hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know em all and i know one thatll make you look simply lovely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was profoundly indifferent to what happened to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> life seemed a show in which she had no part and at which she sat a listless spectator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few minutes and in puffed jeffries solicitous as a fussy old bird with a new family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried he before he had looked at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youll have a lovely time with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a perfect gentlemanknows how to treat a lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the minute i laid eyes on you i said to myself said i jeffries shes a mascot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you mustnt talk business with him you understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a gentleman you know and it dont do to mix business and social pleasures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you string him along quiet and ladylike and elegant as if there wasnt any such things as cloaks or dresses in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you land the order my dear ill see that you get a nice present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a nice dressthe one were going to lend youif he gives us a slice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dress and twentyfive in cash if he gives us all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel as if we had it with his o <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dontdont count on me too much she said hesitatingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not in very good spirits im sorry to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jeffries hesitated made an effort blurted out what was for him the business man a giddy generosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on your way out stop at the cashiers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell give you this weeks pay in advance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see you wont have been with us a full week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he hurried away frightened by his prodigality by these hysterical impulses that were rushing him far from the course of sound business sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as jones says im a generous old fool he muttered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jeffries sent mary hinkle home with susan to carry the dress and hat to help her make a toilet and to start her off right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the hour before they left the store there was offered a typical illustration of why and how business is able to suspend the normal moral sense and to substitute for it a highly ingenious counterfeit of supreme moral obligation to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hysterical jeffries had infected the entire personnel with his excitement with the sense that a great battle was impending and that the cause of the house which was the cause of everyone who drew pay from it had been intrusted to the young recruit with the fascinating figure and the sweet sad face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and susans sensitive nature was soon vibrating in response to this feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it terrified her that she the inexperienced had such grave responsibility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made her heart heavy to think of probable failure when the house had been so good to her had taken her in had given her unusual wages had made it possible for her to get a start in life had intrusted to her its cause its chance to retrieve a bad season and to protect its employees instead of discharging a lot of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked mary hinkle as they walked up broadway she carrying the dress and susan the hat box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have long white glovesand a pair of white stockings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh jeffries told me to ask youand to go to work and buy them if you hadnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan was about to pay when mary stopped her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you pay said she maybe youll get your money back from the house and maybe you wont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i pay theyll not make a kick on giving it back to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dress mary had selected was a simple white batiste cut out at the neck prettily and with the elbow sleeves that were then the fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your arms and throat are lovely said mary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and your hands are mighty nice toothats why im sure youve never been a real working girlleastways not for a long time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you get to the restaurant and draw off your gloves in a slow careless ladylike kind of way and put your elbows on the tablemy how he will take on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary looked at her with an intense but not at all malignant envy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont land high itll be because youre a fool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i guess im whats called a foolwhat probably is a fool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you want to look out then warned miss hinkle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you want to go to work and get over that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beauty dont count unless a girls got shrewdness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the streets are full of beauties sellin out for a bare living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they thought they couldnt help winning and they got left and the plain girls who had to hustle and manage have passed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go to dels or rectors or the waldorf or the madrid or any of those hightoned places and see the women with the swell clothes and jewelry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the married ones and the other kind both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trouble with me is ive been too goodhearted and too soft about being flattered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was too good looking and a small easy living came too easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youid say you werethat you had brains but were shy about using them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then too youve got to go to work and look out about being too refined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the refined nice ones goes the lowestif they get pushedand this is a pushing world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll get pushed just as far as youll let em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these disagreeable truthsfor observation and experience made her fear they were truthsfilled her with despondency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as between the morality she had been taught and the practical morality of this world upon which she had been cast which was the right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary hinkle was shocked by the poor little room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it wont last longnot after tonight if you play your cards halfway right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt no interest in the toilet until the dress and hat were unpacked and laid out upon the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sight of them her eyes became a keen and lively graynever violet for that kind of emotionand there surged up the love of finery that dwells in every normal womanand in every normal manthat is put there by a heredity dating back through the ages to the very beginning of conscious lifeand does not leave them until life gives up the battle and prepares to vacate before death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ellen the maid passing the door saw and entered to add her ecstatic exclamations to the excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tucker who no sooner beheld the glory displayed upon the humble bed than she too was in a turmoil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan dressed with the aid of three maids as interested and eager as ever robed a queen for coronation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ellen brought hot water and a larger bowl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tucker wished to lend a highly scented toilet soap she used when she put on gala attire but susan insisted upon her own plain soap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all helped her bathe they helped her select the best underclothes from her small store <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan would put on her own stockings but ellen got one foot into one of the slippers and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tucker as they knelt together at their task <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a lump on em but like feet in a picture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it takes a mighty good leg to look good in a white stocking observed mary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but yours is so nice and long and slim that theyd stand most anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tucker and ellen stood by with no interference save suggestion and comment while mary who at one time worked for a hairdresser did susans thick dark hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan would permit no elaborations much to miss hinkles regret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the three agreed that she was right when the simple sweep of the vital blueblack hair was finished in a loose and graceful knot at the back and susans small healthily pallid face looked its loveliest with the violetgray eyes soft and sweet and serious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tucker brought the hat from the bed and susan put it ona large black straw of a most becoming shape with two pure white plumes curling round the crown and a third not so long rising gracefully from the big buckle where the three plumes met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now came the putting on of the dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with as much care as if they were handling a rare and fragile vase mary and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tucker held the dress for susan to step into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ellen kept her petticoat in place while the other two escorted the dress up susans form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the three worked together at hooking and smoothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan washed her hands again refused to let mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tucker run and bring powder produced from a drawer some prepared chalk and with it safeguarded her nose against shine she tucked the powder rag into her stocking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last of all the gloves went on and a small handkerchief was thrust into the palm of the left glove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must go right downstairs where its cool and you wont get wilted cried mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the steps and walls aint none too clean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the bathroom downstairs there was a long mirror built into the wall a relic of the old houses long departed youth of grandeur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there susan had the first satisfactory look at herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew she was a pretty woman she would have been weakminded had she not known it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a touch here and there a sinuous shifting of the body within the garments and the suggestion of dressed up vanished before the reflected eyes of her agitated assistants who did not know what had happened but only saw the results <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hardly knew the tall beautiful woman of fashion gazing at her from the mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could it be that this was her hair?these eyes hersand the mouth and nose and the skin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was this long slender figure her very own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never before had susan worn anything nearly so fine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the way i ought to look all the time thought she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this is the way i will look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already her true eye was seeing the defects the chances for improvementhow the hat could be rebent and retrimmed to adapt it to her features how the dress could be altered to make it more tasteful more effective in subtly attracting attention to her figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much do you suppose the dress cost miss hinkle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tucker had been dying to put but had refrained from putting lest it should sound unrefined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thatd mean a hundred and twentyfivea hundred and fifty maybe if you was to try to buy it in a department store <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the hatwell lichtensteind ask fifty or sixty for it and never turn a hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellits worth the money to them that can afford to buy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the good lord put everything on earth to be used i reckon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and miss sackville is the build for things like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now itd be foolish on me with a stomach and sitter that wont let no skirt hang fit to look at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the excitement died from susans face leaving it pale and cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tucker and miss hinkle listening with anxious faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was decided that ellen should go to the door that as she opened it susan should come carelessly from the back room and advance along the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this program was carried out with the result that as gideon said is miss sackville here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss sackville appeared before his widening wondering admiring eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was dressed in the extreme of fashion and costliness in good taste while it would have been impossible for him to look distinguished he did look what he wasa prosperous business man with prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he felt completely outclasseduntil he reminded himself that for all her brave show of fashionable lady she was only a model while he was a fifteenthousandayear man on the way to a partnership <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think we might dine on the veranda at sherrys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sight of him she had nerved herself had keyed herself up toward recklessness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not try to get whatever pleasure there was a chance for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes almost any of the fifth avenue placesexcept the waldorf possiblywas safe enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the circuit of spenser and his friends lay in the more bohemian broadway district <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had taken her to sherrys only once to see as part of a new york education the sunday night crowd of fashionable people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would be able to show off his prize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they drove away susan glanced at the front parlor windows saw the curtains agitated felt the three friendly excited faces palpitating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she leaned from the cab window waved her hand smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the three faces instantly appeared and immediately hid again lest gideon should see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew miss sackville was as common as the rest of emand an old hand at the business no doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he simply could not abruptly break through the barrier he must squirm through gradually <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a swell outfit youve got on he began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss hinkle borrowed it out of the stock for me to wear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew how she had got the hat and dress but he expected her to make a pretense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such candorany kind of candorwasnt in the game of men and women as women had played it in his experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the womenall sorts of womenlied and faked at their business just as men did in the business of buying and selling goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and her voiceand her way of speakingthey made him feel more than ever out of his class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must get something to drink as soon as it could be served that would put him at his ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a drink for herthat would bring her down from this queer new kind of high horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess she must be a top notcherthe real thing come down in the worldand not out of the near silks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but shell be all right after a drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one drink of liquor makes the whole world kin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that last thought reminded him of his own cleverness and he attacked the situation afresh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the conversation as they drove up the avenue was on the whole constrained and intermittentchiefly about the weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up bubbled her young spirits perpetually renewed by her healthy vital youth of body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was seeing her beloved city of the sun again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they turned out of the avenue for sherrys main entrance susan realized that she was in fortyfourth street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the street where she and spenser had lived!had lived only yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes closed and she leaned back in the cab <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw that something was wrong it stood out obviously in her ghastly face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he feared the carriage men round the entrance would catch on to the fact that he was escorting a girl so unused to swell surroundings that she was ready to faint with fright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan revived herself descended and with head bent low and trembling body entered the restaurant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the agitation of getting a table and settling at it gideon forgot for the moment her sickly pallor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to order at once not consulting herfor he prided himself on his knowledge of cookery and assumed that she knew nothing about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you need it bad and you need it quick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had intended to drink nothing but she must have aid in conquering her faintness and overwhelming depression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gideon took a dry martini ordered a second for himself when the first came and had them both down before she finished her sherry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most ladies do but i cant stand seeing it served even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gideon glinted his eyes gayly at her showed his white jaguar teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was feeling his absurd notion of inequality in her favor dissipate as the fumes of the cocktails rose straight and strong from his empty stomach to his brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know ive a sort of feeling that were going to like each other a lot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we make a handsome coupleehwhats your first name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my names ed but everybody calls me gid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as the melon was served he ordered the champagne opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to our better acquaintance said he lifting his glass toward her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you said she in a suffocated voice touching her glass to her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was too polite to speak even in banter of what he thought was the real cause of her politeness and silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he must youre kind o shy arent you lorna <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve had a very interesting life havent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ohjust ordinary replied he with a proper show of modesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and straightway as susan had hoped he launched into a minute account of himselfthe familiar story of the energetic aggressive man twisting and kicking his way up from two or three dollars a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan seemed interested but her mind refused to occupy itself with a narrative so commonplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after rod and his friends this boastful business man was dull and tedious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever he laughed at an account of his superior crafthow he had bluffed this man how he had euchered that oneshe smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so in one more case the common masculine delusion that women listen to them on the subject of themselves with interest and admiration as profound as their own was not impaired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he wound up ive stayed plain ed gideon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never have let prosperity swell my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and anyone that knows mell tell you im a regular fool for generosity with those that come at me right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive always been a favorite with the ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he was pausing for comment from her she said i can believe it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the word generosity kept echoing in her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everyone was forever praising himself for his generosity was reciting acts of the most obvious selfishness in proof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was there any such thing in the whole world as real generosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im tight in businessi can see a dollar as far as the next man and chase it as hard and grab it as tight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when it comes to the ladies why im openhanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they treat me right i treat them right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then fearing that he had tactlessly raised a doubt of his invincibility he hastily added but they always do treat me right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he had been talking on and on susan had been appealing to the champagne to help her quiet her aching heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she resolutely set her thoughts to wandering among the couples at the other tables in that subdued softening lightthe beautifully dressed women listening to their male companions with close attentionwere they too being bored by such trash by way of talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fellow had probably before experienced the weight of a guardsmans arm and instantly drove off crying out that i had cheated him and should hear of him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his flight caused me of course the greatest alarm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no doubt that he would immediately give information to the police <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have ruined me said i to lescaut i shall be no longer safe at your house we must go hence at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave manon my arm and as quickly as possible got out of the dangerous neighbourhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chevalier des grieux having occupied more than an hour with his story i begged him to give himself a little rest and meanwhile to share our supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw by the attention we paid him that we were amused and promised that we should hear something of perhaps greater interest in the sequel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we had finished supper he continued in the following words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how chances mock and changes fill the cup of alteration with divers liquors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had hardly proceeded for five minutes on our way when a man whose face i could not see recognised lescaut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had no doubt been watching for him near his home with the horrible intention which he now unhappily executed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he snapping a pistol at his head he shall sup tonight with the angels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lescaut fell without the least sign of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pressed manon to fly for we could be of no use to a dead man and i feared being arrested by the police who would certainly be soon upon the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned down the first narrow street with her and the servant she was so overpowered by the scene she had just witnessed that i could hardly support her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last at the end of the street i perceived a hackneycoach we got into it but when the coachman asked whither he should drive i was scarcely able to answer him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no certain asylumno confidential friend to whom i could have recourse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was almost destitute of money having but one dollar left in my purse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fright and fatigue had so unnerved manon that she was almost fainting at my side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my imagination too was full of the murder of lescaut and i was not without strong apprehensions of the patrol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i luckily remembered the inn at chaillot where we first went to reside in that village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hoped to be not only secure but to continue there for some time without being pressed for payment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take us to chaillot said i to the coachman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he refused to drive us so far at that late hour for less than twelve francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last we agreed for half that sumall that my purse contained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried to console manon as we went along but despair was rankling in my own heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have destroyed myself a thousand times over if i had not felt that i held in my arms all that could attach me to life this reflection reconciled me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i possess her at least said i she loves me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vainly does tiberge call this a mere phantom of happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could without feeling interest or emotion see the whole world besides perish around me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i have in it no object of affection beyond her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this sentiment was true however while i so lightly esteemed the good things of the world i felt that there was no doing without some little portion of them were it only to inspire a more thorough contempt for the remainder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> love is more powerful than wealthmore attractive than grandeur or fame but alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it cannot exist without certain artificial aids and there is nothing more humiliating to the feelings of a sensitive lover than to find himself by want of means reduced to the level of the most vulgar minds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was eleven oclock when we arrived at chaillot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they received us at the inn as old acquaintances and expressed no sort of surprise at seeing manon in male attire for it was the custom in paris and the environs to adopt all disguises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took care to have her served with as much attention as if i had been in prosperous circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was ignorant of my poverty and i carefully kept her so being resolved to return alone the following day to paris to seek some cure for this vexatious kind of malady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at supper she appeared pale and thin i had not observed this at the hospital as the room in which i saw her was badly lighted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked her if the excessive paleness were not caused by the shock of witnessing her brothers death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she assured me that horrified as she naturally was at the event her paleness was purely the effect of a three months absence from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a thousand times more than i can tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this assurance was confirmed by so many caresses and vows that it appeared impossible she could to the end of time forget them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never doubted that she was at that moment sincere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what motive could she have had for dissembling to such a degree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she became afterwards still more volatile than ever or rather she was no longer anything and entirely forgot herself when in poverty and want she saw other women living in abundance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was now on the point of receiving a new proof of her inconstancy which threw all that had passed into the shade and which led to the strangest adventure that ever happened to a man of my birth and prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i knew her disposition i hastened the next day to paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is what we have designated as the le troisieme dessous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the demon is vaguely outlined each one is for himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the i in the eyes howls seeks fumbles and gnaws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wild spectres who roam in this grave almost beasts almost phantoms are not occupied with universal progress they are ignorant both of the idea and of the word they take no thought for anything but the satisfaction of their individual desires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are almost unconscious and there exists within them a sort of terrible obliteration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have two mothers both stepmothers ignorance and misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have a guide necessity and for all forms of satisfaction appetite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are brutally voracious that is to say ferocious not after the fashion of the tyrant but after the fashion of the tiger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from suffering these spectres pass to crime fatal affiliation dizzy creation logic of darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute it is the protest of matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be hungry to be thirstythat is the point of departure to be satanthat is the point reached <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have just seen in book fourth one of the compartments of the upper mine of the great political revolutionary and philosophical excavation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there as we have just said all is pure noble dignified honest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there assuredly one might be misled but error is worthy of veneration there so thoroughly does it imply heroism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the work there effected taken as a whole has a name progress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths hideous depths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there exists beneath society we insist upon this point and there will exist until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated the great cavern of evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this cavern is below all and is the foe of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this cavern knows no philosophers its dagger has never cut a pen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the inkstand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this stifling ceiling turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> babeuf is a speculator to cartouche marat is an aristocrat to schinderhannes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this cavern has for its object the destruction of everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> including the upper superior mines which it execrates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it not only undermines in its hideous swarming the actual social order it undermines philosophy it undermines human thought it undermines civilization it undermines revolution it undermines progress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its name is simply theft prostitution murder assassination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the others those above it have but one objectto suppress it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is to this point that philosophy and progress tend with all their organs simultaneously by their amelioration of the real as well as by their contemplation of the absolute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> destroy the cavern ignorance and you destroy the lair crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us condense in a few words a part of what we have just written <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all men are made of the same clay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no difference here below at least in predestination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same shadow in front the same flesh in the present the same ashes afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ignorance mingled with the human paste blackens it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this incurable blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there converted into evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a quartette of ruffians claquesous gueulemer babet and montparnasse governed the third lower floor of paris from to gueulemer was a hercules of no defined position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for his lair he had the sewer of the archemarion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was six feet high his pectoral muscles were of marble his biceps of brass his breath was that of a cavern his torso that of a colossus his head that of a bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thought one beheld the farnese hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet waistcoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gueulemer built after this sculptural fashion might have subdued monsters he had found it more expeditious to be one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a low brow large temples less than forty years of age but with crowsfeet harsh short hair cheeks like a brush a beard like that of a wild boar the reader can see the man before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his muscles called for work his stupidity would have none of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had probably somewhat to do with marshal brune having been a porter at avignon in after this stage he had turned ruffian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the diaphaneity of babet contrasted with the grossness of gueulemer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> daylight was visible through his bones but nothing through his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been a jack of all trades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a man of purpose a fine talker who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his occupation consisted in selling in the open air plaster busts and portraits of the head of the state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had exhibited phenomena at fairs and he had owned a booth with a trumpet and this poster babet dental artist member of the academies makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids extracts teeth undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> price one tooth one franc fifty centimes two teeth two francs three teeth two francs fifty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this take advantage of this opportunity meant have as many teeth extracted as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been married and had had children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not know what had become of his wife and children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had lost them as one loses his handkerchief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> babet read the papers a striking exception in the world to which he belonged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day at the period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels he had read in the messager that a woman had just given birth to a child who was doing well and had a calfs muzzle and he exclaimed theres a fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wife has not the wit to present me with a child like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later on he had abandoned everything in order to undertake paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waited until the sky was daubed with black before he showed himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at nightfall he emerged from the hole whither he returned before daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness and with his back turned to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a candle was brought he put on a mask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> babet said claquesous is a nocturne for two voices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one was sure whether he had a name claquesous being a sobriquet none was sure that he had a voice as his stomach spoke more frequently than his voice no one was sure that he had a face as he was never seen without his mask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he disappeared as though he had vanished into thin air when he appeared it was as though he sprang from the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> montparnasse was a child less than twenty years of age with a handsome face lips like cherries charming black hair the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes he had all vices and aspired to all crimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the street boy turned pickpocket and a pickpocket turned garroter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was genteel effeminate graceful robust sluggish ferocious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rim of his hat was curled up on the left side in order to make room for a tuft of hair after the style of he lived by robbery with violence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his coat was of the best cut but threadbare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> montparnasse was a fashionplate in misery and given to the commission of murders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cause of all this youths crimes was the desire to be welldressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first grisette who had said to him you are handsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had cast the stain of darkness into his heart and had made a cain of this abel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finding that he was handsome he desired to be elegant now the height of elegance is idleness idleness in a poor man means crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at eighteen he had already numerous corpses in his past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more than one passerby lay with outstretched arms in the presence of this wretch with his face in a pool of blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> curled pomaded with laced waist the hips of a woman the bust of a prussian officer the murmur of admiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him his cravat knowingly tied a bludgeon in his pocket a flower in his buttonhole such was this dandy of the sepulchre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these four ruffians formed a sort of proteus winding like a serpent among the police and striving to escape vidocqs indiscreet glances under divers forms tree flame fountain lending each other their names and their traps hiding in their own shadows boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each other stripping off their personalities as one removes his false nose at a masked ball sometimes simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that cocolatour himself took them for a whole throng <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these four men were not four men they were a sort of mysterious robber with four heads operating on a grand scale on paris they were that monstrous polyp of evil which inhabits the crypt of society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thanks to their ramifications and to the network underlying their relations babet gueulemer claquesous and montparnasse were charged with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of the seine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inventors of ideas of that nature men with nocturnal imaginations applied to them to have their ideas executed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they furnished the canvas to the four rascals and the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder and which were sufficiently lucrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a crime was in quest of arms they underlet their accomplices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were in the habit of assembling at nightfall the hour when they woke up on the plains which adjoin the salpetriere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had twelve black hours before them they regulated their employment accordingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> patronminettesuch was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean circulation on the association of these four men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the fantastic ancient popular parlance which is vanishing day by day patronminette signifies the morning the same as entre chien et loupbetween dog and wolfsignifies the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this appellation patronminette was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these four men were known under this title <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the president of the assizes visited lacenaire in his prison and questioned him concerning a misdeed which lacenaire denied who did it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lacenaire made this response enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned but clear to the police perhaps it was patronminette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians composing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here are the appellations to which the principal members of patronminette answeredfor the names have survived in special memoirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a brujon dynasty we cannot refrain from boulatruelle the roadmender already introduced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we pass over some and not the worst of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they do not express merely beings but species <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the under side of civilization <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those beings who were not very lavish with their countenances were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fatigued by the wild nights which they passed they went off by day to sleep sometimes in the limekilns sometimes in the abandoned quarries of montmatre or montrouge sometimes in the sewers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horace speaks of them ambubaiarum collegia pharmacopolae mendici mimae and so long as society remains what it is they will remain what they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath the obscure roof of their cavern they are continually born again from the social ooze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they return spectres but always identical only they no longer bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the vagrant to the tramp the race is maintained in its purity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they divine purses in pockets they scent out watches in fobs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gold and silver possess an odor for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there exist ingenuous bourgeois of whom it might be said that they have a stealable air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a man from the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these men are terrible when one encounters them or catches a glimpse of them towards midnight on a deserted boulevard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows that they are in no wise distinct from them that they possess no other soul than the darkness and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life that they have separated from the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a single bat can resist the dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leblanc nor the young girl had again set foot in the luxembourg garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thenceforth marius had but one thoughtto gaze once more on that sweet and adorable face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sought constantly he sought everywhere he found nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was no longer marius the enthusiastic dreamer the firm resolute ardent man the bold defier of fate the brain which erected future on future the young spirit encumbered with plans with projects with pride with ideas and wishes he was a lost dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vast nature formerly so filled with forms lights voices counsels perspectives horizons teachings now lay empty before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him that everything had disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought incessantly for he could not do otherwise but he no longer took pleasure in his thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to everything that they proposed to him in a whisper he replied in his darkness what is the use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was so happy at the mere sight of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at me was not that immense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> courfeyrac to whom he confided nothingit was his nature but who made some little guess at everythingthat was his nature had begun by congratulating him on being in love though he was amazed at it then seeing marius fall into this melancholy state he ended by saying to him i see that you have been simply an animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once having confidence in a fine september sun marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at sceaux by courfeyrac bossuet and grantaire hoping what a dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course he did not see the one he sought.but this is the place all the same where all lost women are found grumbled grantaire in an aside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot alone through the night weary feverish with sad and troubled eyes stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way home from the feast which passed close to him as he in his discouragement breathed in the acrid scent of the walnuttrees along the road in order to refresh his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took to living more and more alone utterly overwhelmed wholly given up to his inward anguish going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the trap seeking the absent one everywhere stupefied by love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on another occasion he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he met in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the boulevard des invalides a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair and scrutinized the man who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strange to say he thought that he recognized m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hair was the same also the profile so far as the cap permitted a view of it the mien identical only more depressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he recovered himself his first impulse was to follow the man who knows whether he did not hold at last the clue which he was seeking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in any case he must see the man near at hand and clear up the mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the idea occurred to him too late the man was no longer there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had turned into some little side street and marius could not find him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all he said to himself it was probably only a resemblance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paid no attention to any one there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that epoch to tell the truth there were no other inhabitants in the house except himself and those jondrettes whose rent he had once paid without moreover ever having spoken to either father mother or daughters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other lodgers had moved away or had died or had been turned out in default of payment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day during that winter the sun had shown itself a little in the afternoon but it was the d of february that ancient candlemas day whose treacherous sun the precursor of a six weeks cold spell inspired mathieu laensberg with these two lines quil luise ou quil luiserne whether the sun shines brightly or dim the bear returns to his cave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius had just emerged from his night was falling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the hour for his dinner for he had been obliged to take to dining again alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had just crossed his threshold where maam bougon was sweeping what is there that is cheap now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble you can get that for nothing the trouble of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier in order to reach the rue saintjacques <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all at once he felt some one elbow him in the dusk he wheeled round and saw two young girls clad in rags the one tall and slim the other a little shorter who were passing rapidly all out of breath in terror and with the appearance of fleeing they had been coming to meet him had not seen him and had jostled him as they passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the twilight marius could distinguish their livid faces their wild heads their dishevelled hair their hideous bonnets their ragged petticoats and their bare feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were talking as the bobbies have come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came near nabbing me at the halfcircle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through this repulsive slang marius understood that gendarmes or the police had come near apprehending these two children and that the latter had escaped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him and there created for a few minutes in the gloom a sort of vague white spot then disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was about to pursue his way when his eye lighted on a little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good he said to himself those unhappy girls dropped it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he retraced his steps he called he did not find them he reflected that they must already be far away put the package in his pocket and went off to dine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the way he saw in an alley of the rue mouffetard a childs coffin covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs and illuminated by a candle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is one thing sadder than to see ones children die it is to see them leading an evil life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his thoughts and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in the open air and the broad daylight beneath the beautiful trees of luxembourg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young girls are always appearing to me only formerly they were angels and now they are ghouls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that evening as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed his hand came in contact in the pocket of his coat with the packet which he had picked up on the boulevard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought that it would be well to open it and that this package might possibly contain the address of the young girls if it really belonged to them and in any case the information necessary to a restitution to the person who had lost it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not sealed and contained four letters also unsealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first was addressed to madame madame la marquise de grucheray the place opposite the chamber of deputies no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius said to himself that he should probably find in it the information which he sought and that moreover the letter being open it was probable that it could be read without impropriety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame la marquise the virtue of clemency and piety is that which most closely unites sosiety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turn your christian spirit and cast a look of compassion on this unfortunate spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy who has given with his blood consecrated his fortune evverything to defend that cause and today finds himself in the greatest missery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he doubts not that your honorable person will grant succor to preserve an existence exteremely painful for a military man of education and honor full of wounds counts in advance on the humanity which animates you and on the interest which madame la marquise bears to a nation so unfortunate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their prayer will not be in vain and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be madame don alvares spanish captain of cavalry a royalist who has take refuge in france who finds himself on travells for his country and the resources are lacking him to continue his travells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius hoped to find the address in the second letter whose superscription read a madame madame la comtesse de montvernet rue cassette no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame la comtesse it is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sick since my last confinement abandoned by my husband five months ago haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the hope of madame la comtesse she has the honor to be madame with profound respect mistress balizard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius turned to the third letter which was a petition like monsieur pabourgeot elector wholesale stocking merchant rue saintdenis on the corner of the rue aux fers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the theatrefrancais <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the subject is historical and the action takes place in auvergne in the time of the empire the style i think is natural laconic and may have some merit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are couplets to be sung in four places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the comic the serious the unexpected are mingled in a variety of characters and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which proceeds misteriously and ends after striking altarations in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animates the man of our century that is to say the fashion that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of these qualities i have reason to fear that jealousy the egotism of priviliged authors may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre for i am not ignorant of the mortifications with which newcomers are treated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsiuer pabourgeot your just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will explain our indigant situation to you lacking bread and fire in this wynter season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i say to you that i beg you to accept the dedication of my drama which i desire to make to you and of all those that i shall make is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection and of adorning my writings with your name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you deign to honor me with the most modest offering i shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which i shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the drama and delivered on the stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to monsieur and madame pabourgeot my most respectful complements genflot man of letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the address ran to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saintjacquesduhautpas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> benevolent man if you deign to accompany my daughter you will behold a misserable calamity and i will show you my certificates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence for true philosophers always feel lively emotions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> admit compassionate man that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need and that it is very painful for the sake of obtaining a little relief to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> destinies are very fatal for several and too prodigal or too protecting for others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i await your presence or your offering if you deign to make one and i beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be truly magnanimous man your very humble and very obedient servant p <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after perusing these four letters marius did not find himself much further advanced than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place not one of the signers gave his address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they seemed to come from four different individuals don alveras mistress balizard the poet genflot and dramatic artist fabantou but the singular thing about these letters was that all four were written by the same hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what conclusion was to be drawn from this except that they all come from the same person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four the odor of tobacco was the same and although an attempt had been made to vary the style the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity and the man of letters genflot was no more exempt from them than the spanish captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had it not been a chance find it would have borne the air of a mystification <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well and to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous of playing with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind mans buff between the four letters and that they were making sport of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing however indicated that these letters belonged to the two young girls whom marius had met on the boulevard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all they were evidently papers of no value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius replaced them in their envelope flung the whole into a corner and went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about seven oclock in the morning he had just risen and breakfasted and was trying to settle down to work when there came a soft knock at his door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he owned nothing he never locked his door unless occasionally though very rarely when he was engaged in some pressing work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even when absent he left his key in the lock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth is however that he had one day been robbed of an old pair of boots to the great triumph of maam bougon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came a second knock as gentle as the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked marius without raising his eyes from the books and manuscripts on his table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me sir it was a dull broken hoarse strangled voice the voice of an old man roughened with brandy and liquor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius turned round hastily and beheld a young girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a very young girl was standing in the halfopen door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dormer window of the garret through which the light fell was precisely opposite the door and illuminated the figure with a wan light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a frail emaciated slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her girdle was a string her head ribbon a string her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise a blond and lymphatic pallor earthcolored collarbones red hands a halfopen and degraded mouth missing teeth dull bold base eyes she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth and the look of a corrupt old woman fifty years mingled with fifteen one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius had risen and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most heartbreaking thing of all was that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in her early childhood she must even have been pretty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winters day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that face was not wholly unknown to marius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought he remembered having seen it somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is a letter for you monsieur marius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she called marius by his name he could not doubt that he was the person whom she wanted but who was this girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without waiting for him to tell her to advance she entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she entered resolutely staring with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed at the whole room and the unmade bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she held a letter in her hand which she presented to marius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius as he opened the letter noticed that the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the message could not have come my amiable neighbor young man i have learned of your goodness to me that you paid my rent six months ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days four persons and my spouse ill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i am not deseaved in my opinion i think i may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity jondrette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my eldest daughter will await your orders dear monsieur marius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this letter coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied marius thoughts ever since the preceding evening was like a candle in a cellar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this letter came from the same place as the other four <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the same writing the same style the same orthography the same paper the same odor of tobacco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were five missives five histories five signatures and a single signer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spanish captain don alvares the unhappy mistress balizard the dramatic poet genflot the old comedian fabantou were all four named jondrette if indeed jondrette himself were named jondrette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time and he had had as we have said but very rare occasion to see to even catch a glimpse of his extremely mean neighbors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mind was elsewhere and where the mind is there the eyes are also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been obliged more than once to pass the jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs but they were mere forms to him he had paid so little heed to them that on the preceding evening he had jostled the jondrette girls on the boulevard without recognizing them for it had evidently been they and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him in spite of disgust and pity a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he understood that his neighbor jondrette in his distress exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons that he procured addresses and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril for this father had come to such a pass that he risked his daughters he was playing a game with fate and he used them as the stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius understood that probably judging from their flight on the evening before from their breathless condition from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard these unfortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession and that the result of the whole was in the midst of human society as it is now constituted two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sad creatures without name or sex or age to whom neither good nor evil were any longer possible and who on emerging from childhood have already nothing in this world neither liberty nor virtue nor responsibility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> souls which blossomed out yesterday and are faded today like those flowers let fall in the streets which are soiled with every sort of mire while waiting for some wheel to crush them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless while marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she kicked about without troubling herself as to her nakedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> occasionally her chemise which was untied and torn fell almost to her waist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she moved the chairs about she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode she handled marius clothes she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she hummed scraps of vaudevilles as though she had been alone frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an indescribable constraint weariness and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room and so to speak flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight or which has broken its wing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one felt that under other conditions of education and destiny the gay and overfree mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never even among animals does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is only to be seen among men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius reflected and allowed her to have her way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she resumed and her accent expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something i know how to read i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table and read general bauduin received orders to take the chateau of hougomont which stands in the middle of the plain of waterloo with five battalions of his brigade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are fine bonapartists in our house that we are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here im going to write a word to show you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and before he had time to answer she wrote on a sheet of white paper which lay in the middle of the table the bobbies are here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have received an education my sister and i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have not always been as we are now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were not made here she paused fixed her dull eyes on marius and burst out laughing saying with an intonation which contained bah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you ever go to the play monsieur marius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a little brother who is a friend of the artists and who gives me tickets sometimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont like the benches in the galleries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are rough people there sometimes and people who smell bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius that you are a very handsome fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both and made her smile and him blush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stepped up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder you pay no heed to me but i know you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meet you here on the staircase and then i often see you going to a person named father mabeuf who lives in the direction of austerlitz sometimes when i have been strolling in that quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very becoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tried to render her voice soft but only succeeded in making it very deep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips as though on a piano where some notes are missing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle said he with his cool gravity i have here a package which belongs to you i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he held out the envelope containing the four letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope dieu de dieu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see we let it fall when we were running <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was that brat of a sister of mine who was so stupid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we got home we could not find it anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we did not wish to be beaten as that is useless as that is entirely useless as that is absolutely useless we said that we had carried the letters to the proper persons and that they had said to us nix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how did you find out that they belonged to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it was you that we jostled as we passed last night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said to my sister is it a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my sister said to me i think it is a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saintjacquesduhautpas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said she this is for that old fellow who goes to mass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps he will give us something to breakfast on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday our breakfast of yesterday our dinner of today and all that at once and this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this reminded marius of the wretched girls errand to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and found nothing there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young girl went on and seemed to have no consciousness of marius presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last winter before we came here we lived under the arches of the bridges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i thought of drowning myself i said to myself no its too cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go out alone whenever i choose i sometimes sleep in the ditches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know at night when i walk along the boulevard i see the trees like forks i see houses all black and as big as notre dame i fancy that the white walls are the river i say to myself why theres water there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stars are like the lamps in illuminations one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out i am bewildered as though horses were breathing in my ears although it is night i hear handorgans and spinningmachines and i dont know what all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think people are flinging stones at me i flee without knowing whither everything whirls and whirls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you feel very queer when you have had no food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then she stared at him with a bewildered air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by dint of searching and ransacking his pockets marius had finally collected five francs sixteen sous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was all he owned in the world for the moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at all events he thought there is my dinner for today and tomorrow we will see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kept the sixteen sous and handed the five francs to the young girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as though the sun had possessed the property of melting five francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she pulled her chemise up on her shoulders made a low bow to marius good morning sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she passed she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode which was moulding there amid the dust she flung herself upon it thats good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius had lived for five years in poverty in destitution even in distress but he now perceived that he had not known real misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> true misery he had but just had a view of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing the misery of woman is what he must see he who has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing he must see the misery of the child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a man has reached his last extremity he has reached his last resources at the same time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woe to the defenceless beings who surround him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> work wages bread fire courage good will all fail him simultaneously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light of day seems extinguished without the moral light within in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the woman and the child and bends them violently to ignominy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> despair is surrounded with fragile partitions which all open on either vice or crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> health youth honor all the shy delicacies of the young body the heart virginity modesty that epidermis of the soul are manipulated in sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources which encounters opprobrium and which accomodates itself to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fathers mothers children brothers sisters men women daughters adhere and become incorporated almost like a mineral formation in that dusky promiscuousness of sexes relationships ages infamies and innocences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they crouch back to back in a sort of hut of fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this young girl was to marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad shadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she revealed to him a hideous side of the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement which any one would have yielded to but he marius should have done better than that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world he was elbow to elbow with them he was in some sort the last link of the human race which they touched he heard them live or rather rattle in the death agony beside him and he paid no heed to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every day every instant he heard them walking on the other side of the wall he heard them go and come and speak and he did not even lend an ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and groans lay in those words and he did not even listen to them his thoughts were elsewhere given up to dreams to impossible radiances to loves in the air to follies and all the while human creatures his brothers in jesus christ his brothers in the people were agonizing in vain beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he even formed a part of their misfortune and he aggravated it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive any ordinary and charitable man evidently their indigence would have been noticed their signals of distress would have been perceived and they would have been taken hold of and rescued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they appeared very corrupt and very depraved no doubt very vile very odious even but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare besides there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word a fatal word the miserable whose fault is this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then should not the charity be all the more profound in proportion as the fall is great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while reading himself this moral lesson for there were occasions on which marius like all truly honest hearts was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved he stared at the wall which separated him from the jondrettes as though he were able to make his gaze full of pity penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams and as the reader had just learned it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only a man as dreamy as marius could have failed to perceive this long before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no paper pasted on the wall either on the side of the jondrettes or on that of marius the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius examined the partition almost unconsciously sometimes revery examines observes and scrutinizes as thought would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all at once he sprang up he had just perceived near the top close to the ceiling a triangular hole which resulted from the space between three lathes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing and by mounting on the commode a view could be had through this aperture into the jondrettes attic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the peephole is a judas in french <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us get some little idea of what these people are like thought marius and in what condition they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he climbed upon the commode put his eye to the crevice and looked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cities like forests have their caverns in which all the most wicked and formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only in cities that which thus conceals itself is ferocious unclean and petty that is to say ugly in forests that which conceals itself is ferocious savage and grand that is to say beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking one lair with another the beasts is preferable to the mans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marius was poor and his chamber was povertystricken but as his poverty was noble his garret was neat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the den upon which his eye now rested was abject dirty fetid pestiferous mean sordid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only furniture consisted of a straw chair an infirm table some old bits of crockery and in two of the corners two indescribable pallets all the light was furnishd by a dormer window of four panes draped with spiders webs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through this aperture there penetrated just enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the walls had a leprous aspect and were covered with seams and scars like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady a repulsive moisture exuded from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chamber which marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement this one was neither tiled nor planked its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the hovel which had grown black under the longcontinued pressure of feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon this uneven floor where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted and which possessed but one virginity that of the broom were capriciously grouped constellations of old shoes socks and repulsive rags however this room had a fireplace so it was let for forty francs a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was every sort of thing in that fireplace a brazier a pot broken boards rags suspended from nails a birdcage ashes and even a little fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was that it was large <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had projections and angles and black holes the lower sides of roofs bays and promontories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence horrible unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as ones fist woodlice as large as ones foot and perhaps evenwho knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the pallets was near the door the other near the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one end of each touched the fireplace and faced marius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a corner near the aperture through which marius was gazing a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall and at its bottom in large letters was the inscription the dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this represented a sleeping woman and a child also asleep the child on the womans lap an eagle in a cloud with a crown in his beak and the woman thrusting the crown away from the childs head without awaking the latter in the background napoleon in a glory leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with maringo austerlits iena wagramme beneath this frame a sort of wooden panel which was no longer than it was broad stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the wall of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side of some pierglass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting to be rehung <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the table upon which marius descried a pen ink and paper sat a man about sixty years of age small thin livid haggard with a cunning cruel and uneasy air a hideous scoundrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if lavater had studied this visage he would have found the vulture mingled with the attorney there the bird of prey and the pettifogger rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other the pettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble the bird of prey making the pettifogger horrible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was clad in a womans chemise which allowed his hairy breast and his bare arms bristling with gray hair to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath this chemise muddy trousers and boots through which his toes projected were visible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no bread in the hovel but there was still tobacco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was writing probably some more letters like those which marius had read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the corner of the table lay an ancient dilapidated reddish volume and the size which was the antique mo of readingrooms betrayed a romance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the cover sprawled the following title printed in large capitals god the king honor and the ladies by ducray duminil the idea that there is no equality even when you are dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great those who are rich are up above in the acacia alley which is paved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little people the poor the unhappy well what of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are put down below where the mud is up to your knees in the damp places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are put there so that they will decay the sooner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cannot go to see them without sinking into the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused smote the table with his fist and added as he ground oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a big woman who might be forty years of age or a hundred was crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she too was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched with bits of old cloth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a coarse linen apron concealed the half of her petticoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although this woman was doubled up and bent together it could be seen that she was of very lofty stature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a sort of giant beside her husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had hideous hair of a reddish blond which was turning gray and which she thrust back from time to time with her enormous shining hands with their flat nails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside her on the floor wide open lay a book of the same form as the other and probably a volume of the same romance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one of the pallets marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale young girl who sat there half naked and with pendant feet and who did not seem to be listening or seeing or living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on closer scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was the child who had said on the boulevard the evening before i bolted bolted bolted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time then suddenly starts up rapidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is indigence which produces these melancholy human plants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they cut his bonds and with his free arms he made the secret sign of the knooks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly they assisted him to stand upon his feet and they brought him food and drink to strengthen him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our brothers of burzee make queer friends grumbled an ancient knook whose flowing beard was pure white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he who knows our secret sign and signal is entitled to our help whoever he may be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> close your eyes stranger and we will conduct you to your home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis in the laughing valley answered claus shutting his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is but one laughing valley in the known world so we can not go astray remarked the knook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he spoke the sound of his voice seemed to die away so claus opened his eyes to see what caused the change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his astonishment he found himself seated on the bench by his own door with the laughing valley spread out before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that day he visited the woodnymphs and related his adventure to queen zurline and necile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the awgwas have become your enemies said the lovely queen thoughtfully so we must do all we can to protect you from their power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was cowardly to bind him while he slept remarked necile with indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the evil ones are ever cowardly answered zurline but our friends slumber shall not be disturbed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queen herself came to the dwelling of claus that evening and placed her seal on every door and window to keep out the awgwas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and under the seal of queen zurline was placed the seal of the fairies and the seal of the ryls and the seals of the knooks that the charm might become more powerful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and claus carried his toys to the children again and made many more of the little ones happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may guess how angry the king awgwa and his fierce band were when it was known to them that claus had escaped from the forest of ethop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they raged madly for a whole week and then held another meeting among the rocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is useless to carry him where the knooks reign said the king for he has their protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so let us cast him into a cave of our own mountains where he will surely perish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was promptly agreed to and the wicked band set out that night to seize claus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they found his dwelling guarded by the seals of the immortals and were obliged to go away baffled and disappointed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never mind said the king he does not sleep always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next day as claus traveled to the village across the plain where he intended to present a toy squirrel to a lame boy he was suddenly set upon by the awgwas who seized him and carried him away to the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they thrust him within a deep cavern and rolled many huge rocks against the entrance to prevent his escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im as certain of it as it might have been written a hundred times easily on that enormous face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> humpty dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed like a turk on the top of a high wallsuch a narrow one that alice quite wondered how he could keep his balanceand as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction and he didnt take the least notice of her she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how exactly like an egg he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said aloud standing with her hands ready to catch him for she was every moment expecting him to fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its very provoking humpty dumpty said after a long silence looking away from alice as he spoke to be called an egg i said you looked like an egg sir alice gently explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some eggs are very pretty you know she added hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some people said humpty dumpty looking away from her as alice didnt know what to say to this it wasnt at all like conversation she thought as he never said anything to her in fact his last remark was evidently addressed to a treeso she humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty dumpty had a great fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the kings horses and all the kings men that last line is much too long for the poetry she added almost out loud forgetting that humpty dumpty would hear her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont stand there chattering to yourself like that humpty dumpty said looking at her for the first time but tell me your its a stupid enough name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it must humpty dumpty said with a short laugh my name means the shape i amand a good handsome shape it is why do you sit out here all alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said alice not wishing to begin an argument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think youd be safer down on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alice went on not with any idea of making another riddle but simply in her goodnatured anxiety for the queer creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that wall is so what tremendously easy riddles you ask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why if ever i did fall off which theres no chance ofbut if i did here he pursed his lips and looked so solemn and grand that alice could hardly help laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the author receiving a royalty on the sales as with us i suppose i suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the price of every book is made up of the cost of its publication with a royalty for the author <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the author fixes this royalty at any figure he pleases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course if he puts it unreasonably high it is his own loss for the book will not sell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the amount of this royalty is set to his credit and he is discharged from other service to the nation for so long a period as this credit at the rate of allowance for the support of citizens shall suffice to support him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if his book be moderately successful he has thus a furlough for several months a year two or three years and if he in the mean time produces other successful work the remission of service is extended so far as the sale of that may justify <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an author of much acceptance succeeds in supporting himself by his pen during the entire period of service and the degree of any writers literary ability as determined by the popular voice is thus the measure of the opportunity given him to devote his time to literature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this respect the outcome of our system is not very dissimilar to that of yours but there are two notable differences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place the universally high level of education nowadays gives the popular verdict a conclusiveness on the real merit of literary work which in your day it was as far as possible from having <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the second place there is no such thing now as favoritism of any sort to interfere with the recognition of true merit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every author has precisely the same facilities for bringing his work before the popular tribunal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to judge from the complaints of the writers of your day this absolute equality of opportunity would have been greatly prized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the recognition of merit in other fields of original genius such as music art invention design i said i suppose you follow a similar principle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in art for example as in literature the people are the sole judges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they vote upon the acceptance of statues and paintings for the public buildings and their favorable verdict carries with it the artists remission from other tasks to devote himself to his vocation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on copies of his work disposed of he also derives the same advantage as the author on sales of his books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all these lines of original genius the plan pursued is the same to offer a free field to aspirants and as soon as exceptional talent is recognized to release it from all trammels and let it have free course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the remission of other service in these cases is not intended as a gift or reward but as the means of obtaining more and higher service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course there are various literary art and scientific institutes to which membership comes to the famous and is greatly prized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the highest of all honors in the nation higher than the presidency which calls merely for good sense and devotion to duty is the red ribbon awarded by the vote of the people to the great authors artists engineers physicians and inventors of the generation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not over a certain number wear it at any one time though every bright young fellow in the country loses innumerable nights sleep dreaming of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as if mamma and i would have thought any more of you with it exclaimed edith not that it isnt of course a very fine thing to have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had no choice my dear but to take your father as you found him and make the best of him dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leete replied but as for your mother there she would never have had me if l had not assured her that i was bound to get the red ribbon or at least the blue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont deny that your book publishing system is a considerable improvement on ours both as to its tendency to encourage a real literary vocation and quite as important to discourage mere scribblers but i dont see how it can be made to apply to magazines and newspapers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very well to make a man pay for publishing a book because the expense will be only occasional but no man could afford the expense of publishing a newspaper every day in the year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took the deep pockets of our private capitalists to do that and often exhausted even them before the returns came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you have newspapers at all they must i fancy be published by the government at the public expense with government editors reflecting government opinions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if your system is so perfect that there is never anything to criticize in the conduct of affairs this arrangement may answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> otherwise i should think the lack of an independent unofficial medium for the expression of public opinion would have most unfortunate results <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leete that a free newspaper press with all that it implies was a redeeming incident of the old system when capital was in private hands and that you have to set off the loss of that against your gains in other respects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid i cant give you even that consolation replied dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> west the newspaper press is by no means the only or as we look at it the best vehicle for serious criticism of public affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to us the judgments of your newspapers on such themes seem generally to have been crude and flippant as well as deeply tinctured with prejudice and bitterness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in so far as they may be taken as expressing public opinion they give an unfavorable impression of the popular intelligence while so far as they may have formed public opinion the nation was not to be felicitated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nowadays when a citizen desires to make a serious impression upon the public mind as to any aspect of public affairs he comes out with a book or pamphlet published as other books are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this is not because we lack newspapers and magazines or that they lack the most absolute freedom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the newspaper press is organized so as to be a more perfect expression of public opinion than it possibly could be in your day when private capital controlled and managed it primarily as a moneymaking business and secondarily only as a mouthpiece for the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but said i if the government prints the papers at the public expense how can it fail to control their policy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who appoints the editors if not the government <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the government does not pay the expense of the papers nor appoint their editors nor in any way exert the slightest influence on their policy replied dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people who take the paper pay the expense of its publication choose its editor and remove him when unsatisfactory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will scarcely say i think that such a newspaper press is not a free organ of popular opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> decidedly i shall not i replied but how is it practicable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> supposing some of my neighbors or myself think we ought to have a newspaper reflecting our opinions and devoted especially to our locality trade or profession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we go about among the people till we get the names of such a number that their annual subscriptions will meet the cost of the paper which is little or big according to the largeness of its constituency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the amount of the subscriptions marked off the credits of the citizens guarantees the nation against loss in publishing the paper its business you understand being that of a publisher purely with no option to refuse the duty required <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the subscribers to the paper now elect somebody as editor who if he accepts the office is discharged from other service during his incumbency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of paying a salary to him as in your day the subscribers pay the nation an indemnity equal to the cost of his support for taking him away from the general service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he manages the paper just as one of your editors did except that he has no countingroom to obey or interests of private capital as against the public good to defend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of the first year the subscribers for the next either reelect the former editor or choose any one else to his place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an able editor of course keeps his place indefinitely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the subscription list enlarges the funds of the paper increase and it is improved by the securing of more and better contributors just as your papers were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how is the staff of contributors recompensed since they cannot be paid in money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their golddust had weighed up something like eight thousand dollars and they could not but be contented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men made snowshoes hunted fresh meat for the larder and in the long evenings played endless games of whist and pedro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that the mining had ceased edith nelson turned over the firebuilding and the dishwashing to the men while she darned their socks and mended their clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no grumbling no bickering nor petty quarrelling in the little cabin and they often congratulated one another on the general happiness of the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hans nelson was stolid and easy going while edith had long before won his unbounded admiration by her capacity for getting on with people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harkey a long lank texan was unusually friendly for one with a saturnine disposition and as long as his theory that gold grew was not challenged was quite companionable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fourth member of the party michael dennin contributed his irish wit to the gayety of the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a large powerful man prone to sudden rushes of anger over little things and of unfailing goodhumor under the stress and strain of big things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fifth and last member dutchy was the willing butt of the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he even went out of his way to raise a laugh at his own expense in order to keep things cheerful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his deliberate aim in life seemed to be that of a maker of laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no serious quarrel had ever vexed the serenity of the party and now that each had sixteen hundred dollars to show for a short summers work there reigned the wellfed contented spirit of prosperity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had just sat down to the breakfast table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though it was already eight oclock late breakfasts had followed naturally upon cessation of the steady work at mining a candle in the neck of a bottle lighted the meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edith and hans sat at each end of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one side with their backs to the door sat harkey and dutchy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place on the other side was vacant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hans nelson looked at the empty chair shook his head slowly and with a ponderous attempt at humor said always is he first at the grub <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got up a little ahead of us and went outside harkey answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pretended knowledge of dennins absence and affected a mysterious air while they clamored for information <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edith after a peep into the mens bunk room returned to the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hans looked at her and she shook her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was never late at mealtime before she remarked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> always has he the great appetite like the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is too bad dutchy said with a sad shake of his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were beginning to make merry over their comrades absence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is not hungry no more wailed dutchy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not from the way he pitches into it up to his ears remarked harkey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he does dot shust to be politeful to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know i know and it is too pad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is der way der rich peoples chases after der appetite when it is no more and is running away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shust you open der door und you will see his barefoots in der snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he sees der appetite he will catch it und come to preakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they burst into loud laughter at dutchys nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sound had scarcely died away when the door opened and dennin came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even as they looked he lifted it to his shoulder and fired twice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the first shot dutchy sank upon the table overturning his mug of coffee his yellow mop of hair dabbling in his plate of mush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his forehead which pressed upon the near edge of the plate tilted the plate up against his hair at an angle of fortyfive degrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harkey was in the air in his spring to his feet at the second shot and he pitched face down upon the floor his my god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for want of seats most of the men are lying on the floor all are smoking and the blithe young french canadian who plays so beautifully and catches about fifty speckled trout for each meal is playing the harmonium with a pipe in his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three men who have camped in black canyon for a week are lying like dogs on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are all over six feet high immovably solemn neither smiling at the general hilarity nor at the absurd changes which are being rung on the harmonium <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they may be described as clothed only in boots for their clothes are torn to rags <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have neither seen a woman nor slept under a roof for six months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> negro songs are being sung and before that yankee doodle was played immediately after rule britannia and it made every one but the strangers laugh it sounded so foolish and mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the colder weather is bringing the beasts down from the heights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard both wolves and the mountain lion as i crossed to my cabin last night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please maamsa desperadoa cattle huntthe mustera mad cowa snowstormsnowed upbirdiethe plainsa prairie schoonerdenvera findplum creekbeing agreeablesnowboundthe grey mare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this afternoon as i was reading in my cabin little sam edwards ran in saying mountain jim wants to speak to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this brought to my mind images of infinite worry gauche servants please maam contretemps and the habit growing out of our elaborate and uselessly conventional life of magnifying the importance of similar trifles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then things came up with the tyranny they exercise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i really need nothing more than this log cabin offers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but elsewhere one must have a house and servants and burdens and worriesnot that one may be hospitable and comfortable but for the thick clay in the shape of things which one has accumulated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my log house takes me about five minutes to do and you could eat off the floor and but mountain jim was waiting while i made these reflections to ask us to take a ride and he mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dewy and i had a delightful stroll through colored foliage and then when they were fatigued i changed my horse for his beautiful mare and we galloped and raced in the beautiful twilight in the intoxicating frosty air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dewy wishes you could have seen us as we galloped down the pass the fearfullooking ruffian on my heavy wagon horse and i on his bare wooden saddle from which beaver mink and marten tails and pieces of skin were hanging raggedly with one spur and feet not in the stirrups the mare looking so aristocratic and i so beggarly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a sort of breezy mountain recklessness in everything he passes remarkably acute judgments on men and events on women also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has pathos poetry and humor an intense love of nature strong vanity in certain directions an obvious desire to act and speak in character and sustain his reputation as a desperado a considerable acquaintance with literature a wonderful verbal memory opinions on every person and subject a chivalrous respect for women in his manner which makes it all the more amusing when he suddenly turns round upon one with some graceful raillery a great power of fascination and a singular love of children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children of this house run to him and when he sits down they climb on his broad shoulders and play with his curls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say in the house that no one who has been here thinks any one worth speaking to after jim but i think that this is probably an opinion which time would alter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow he is kept always before the public of colorado for one can hardly take up a newspaper without finding a paragraph about him a contribution by him or a fragment of his biography <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruffian as he looks the first word he speaksto a lady at leastplaces him on a level with educated gentlemen and his conversation is brilliant and full of the light and fitfulness of genius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet on the whole he is a most painful spectacle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his magnificent head shows so plainly the better possibilities which might have been his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his life in spite of a certain dazzle which belongs to it is a ruined and wasted one and one asks what of good can the future have in september of the next year answered the question by laying him down in a dishonored grave with a rifle bullet in his brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were to have had a grand cattle hunt yesterday beginning at but the horses were all lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often out of fifty horses all that are worth anything are marauding and a day is lost in hunting for them in the canyons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however before daylight this morning evans called through my door miss bird i say weve got to drive cattle fifteen miles i wish youd lend a hand theres not enough of us ill give you a good horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scene of the drive is at a height of feet watered by two rapid rivers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on all sides mountains rise to an altitude of from to feet their skirts shaggy with pitchpine forests and scarred by deep canyons wooded and boulder strewn opening upon the mountain pasture previously mentioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two thousand head of halfwild texan cattle are scattered in herds throughout the canyons living on more or less suspicious terms with grizzly and brown bears mountain lions elk mountain sheep spotted deer wolves lynxes wild cats beavers minks skunks chipmunks eagles rattlesnakes and all the other twolegged fourlegged vertebrate and invertebrate inhabitants of this lonely and romantic region <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the whole they show a tendency rather to the habits of wild than of domestic cattle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they march to water in indian file with the bulls leading and when threatened take strategic advantage of ridgy ground slinking warily along in the hollows the bulls acting as sentinels and bringing up the rear in case of an attack from dogs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cows have to be regularly broken in for milking being as wild as buffaloes in their unbroken state but owing to the comparative dryness of the grasses and the system of allowing the calf to have the milk during the daytime a dairy of cows does not produce as much butter as a devonshire dairy of fifty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some necessary cruelty is involved in the stockmans business however humane he may be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the system is one of terrorism and from the time that the calf is bullied into the branding pen and the hot iron burns into his shrinking flesh to the day when the fatted ox is driven down from his boundless pastures to be slaughtered in chicago the fear and dread of man are upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the herds are apt to penetrate the savage canyons which come down from the snowy range when they incur a risk of being snowed up and starved and it is necessary now and then to hunt them out and drive them down to the park <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this occasion the whole were driven down for a muster and for the purpose of branding the calves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes after palming off a particularly fantastic and outrageous lie upon me he was so full of laugh that he had to step aside for a minute upon one pretext or another to keep me from suspecting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i staid faithfully by him until his comedy was finished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he remarked that he had undertaken to learn me all about a steamboat and had done it but that if he had overlooked anything just ask him and he would supply the lack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything about this boat that you dont know the name of or the purpose of you come to me and ill tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said i would and took my departure disappeared and approached him from another quarter whence he could not see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he sat all alone doubling himself up and writhing this way and that in the throes of unappeasable laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must have made himself sick for he was not publicly visible afterward for several days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime the episode dropped out of my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing that reminded me of it now when i was alone at the wheel was the spectacle of this young fellow standing in the pilothouse door with the knob in his hand silently and severely inspecting me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know when i have seen anybody look so injured as he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not say anythingsimply stood there and looked reproachfully looked and pondered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he shut the door and started away halted on the texas a minute came slowly back and stood in the door again with that grieved look in his face yes i confessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauseimpotent struggle for further words then he gave it up choked out a deep strong oath and departed for good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterward i saw him several times below during the trip but he was cold would not look at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> idiot if he had not been in such a sweat to play his witless practical joke upon me in the beginning i would have persuaded his thoughts into some other direction and saved him from committing that wanton and silly impoliteness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had myself called with the four oclock watch mornings for one cannot see too many summer sunrises on the mississippi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first there is the eloquence of silence for a deep hush broods everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next there is the haunting sense of loneliness isolation remoteness from the worry and bustle of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dawn creeps in stealthily the solid walls of black forest soften to gray and vast stretches of the river open up and reveal themselves the water is glasssmooth gives off spectral little wreaths of white mist there is not the faintest breath of wind nor stir of leaf the tranquillity is profound and infinitely satisfying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a bird pipes up another follows and soon the pipings develop into a jubilant riot of music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see none of the birds you simply move through an atmosphere of song which seems to sing itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the light has become a little stronger you have one of the fairest and softest pictures imaginable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have the intense green of the massed and crowded foliage near by you see it paling shade by shade in front of you upon the next projecting cape a mile off or more the tint has lightened to the tender young green of spring the cape beyond that one has almost lost color and the furthest one miles away under the horizon sleeps upon the water a mere dim vapor and hardly separable from the sky above it and about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all this stretch of river is a mirror and you have the shadowy reflections of the leafage and the curving shores and the receding capes pictured in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well that is all beautiful soft and rich and beautiful and when the sun gets well up and distributes a pink flush here and a powder of gold yonder and a purple haze where it will yield the best effect you grant that you have seen something that is worth remembering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had the kentucky bend country in the early morning scene of a strange and tragic accident in the old times captain poe had a small sternwheel boat for years the home of himself and his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night the boat struck a snag in the head of kentucky bend and sank with astonishing suddenness water already well above the cabin floor when the captain got aft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he cut into his wifes stateroom from above with an ax she was asleep in the upper berth the roof a flimsier one than was supposed the first blow crashed down through the rotten boards and clove her skull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this bend is all filled up nowresult of a cutoff and the same agent has taken the great and once muchfrequented walnut bend and set it away back in a solitude far from the accustomed track of passing steamers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena we visited and also a town i had not heard of before it being of recent birtharkansas city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was born of a railway the little rock mississippi river and texas railroad touches the river there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we asked a passenger who belonged there what sort of a place it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said he after considering and with the air of one who wishes to take time and be accurate its a hell of a place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were several rows and clusters of shabby framehouses and a supply of mud sufficient to insure the town against a famine in that article for a hundred years for the overflow had but lately subsided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were stagnant ponds in the streets here and there and a dozen rude scows were scattered about lying aground wherever they happened to have been when the waters drained off and people could do their visiting and shopping on foot once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still it is a thriving place with a rich country behind it an elevator in front of it and also a fine big mill for the manufacture of cottonseed oil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had never seen this kind of a mill before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cottonseed was comparatively valueless in my time but it is worth or a ton now and none of it is thrown away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the oil made from it is colorless tasteless and almost if not entirely odorless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is claimed that it can by proper manipulation be made to resemble and perform the office of any and all oils and be produced at a cheaper rate than the cheapest of the originals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sagacious people shipped it to italy doctored it labeled it and brought it back as olive oil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this trade grew to be so formidable that italy was obliged to put a prohibitory impost upon it to keep it from working serious injury to her oil industry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena occupies one of the prettiest situations on the mississippi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her perch is the last the southernmost group of hills which one sees on that side of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in its normal condition it is a pretty town but the flood or possibly the seepage had lately been ravaging it whole streets of houses had been invaded by the muddy water and the outsides of the buildings were still belted with a broad stain extending upwards from the foundations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stranded and discarded scows lay all about plank sidewalks on stilts four feet high were still standing the board sidewalks on the ground level were loose and ruinous a couple of men trotting along them could make a blind man think a cavalry charge was coming everywhere the mud was black and deep and in many places malarious pools of stagnant water were standing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mississippi inundation is the next most wasting and desolating infliction to a fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had an enjoyable time here on this sunny sunday two full hours liberty ashore while the boat discharged freight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the back streets but few white people were visible but there were plenty of colored folkmainly women and girls and almost without exception upholstered in bright new clothes of swell and elaborate style and cuta glaring and hilarious contrast to the mournful mud and the pensive puddles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena is the second town in arkansas in point of population which is placed at five thousand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena has a good cotton trade handles from forty to sixty thousand bales annually she has a large lumber and grain commerce has a foundry oil mills machine shops and wagon factoriesin brief has invested in manufacturing industries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has two railways and is the commercial center of a broad and prosperous region <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her gross receipts of money annually from all sources are placed by the new orleans timesdemocrat at chapter we were approaching napoleon arkansas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i began to think about my errand there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was badnot best anyway for mine was not preferably a noonday kind of errand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more i thought the more that fact pushed itself upon menow in one form now in another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally it took the form of a distinct question is it good common sense to do the errand in daytime when by a little sacrifice of comfort and inclination you can have night for it and no inquisitive eyes around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plain question and plain answer make the shortest road out of most perplexities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got my friends into my stateroom and said i was sorry to create annoyance and disappointment but that upon reflection it really seemed best that we put our luggage ashore and stop over at napoleon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their disapproval was prompt and loud their language mutinous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their main argument was one which has always been the first to come to the surface in such cases since the beginning of time but you decided and agreed to stick to this boat etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as if having determined to do an unwise thing one is thereby bound to go ahead and make two unwise things of it by carrying out that determination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried various mollifying tactics upon them with reasonably good success under which encouragement i increased my efforts and to show them that i had not created this annoying errand and was in no way to blame for it toward the end of last year i spent a few months in munich bavaria <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in november i was living in fraulein dahlweiners pension a karlstrasse but my working quarters were a mile from there in the house of a widow who supported herself by taking lodgers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and her two young children used to drop in every morning and talk german to meby request <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day during a ramble about the city i visited one of the two establishments where the government keeps and watches corpses until the doctors decide that they are permanently dead and not in a trance state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a grisly place that spacious room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were thirtysix corpses of adults in sight stretched on their backs on slightly slanted boards in three long rowsall of them with waxwhite rigid faces and all of them wrapped in white shrouds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along the sides of the room were deep alcoves like bay windows and in each of these lay several marblevisaged babes utterly hidden and buried under banks of fresh flowers all but their faces and crossed hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around a finger of each of these fifty still forms both great and small was a ring and from the ring a wire led to the ceiling and thence to a bell in a watchroom yonder where day and night a watchman sits always alert and ready to spring to the aid of any of that pallid company who waking out of death shall make a movement for any even the slightest movement will twitch the wire and ring that fearful bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i imagined myself a deathsentinel drowsing there alone far in the dragging watches of some wailing gusty night and having in a twinkling all my body stricken to quivering jelly by the sudden clamor of that awful summons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i inquired about this thing asked what resulted usually <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the watchman died and the restored corpse came and did what it could to make his last moments easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was rebuked for trying to feed an idle and frivolous curiosity in so solemn and so mournful a place and went my way with a humbled crest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a lodger who shall tell you all you want to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a living man but he did not look it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was abed and had his head propped high on pillows his face was wasted and colorless his deepsunken eyes were shut his hand lying on his breast was talonlike it was so bony and longfingered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mans eyes opened slowly and glittered wickedly out from the twilight of their caverns he frowned a black frown he lifted his lean hand and waved us peremptorily away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the widow kept straight on till she had got out the fact that i was a stranger and an american <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mans face changed at once brightened became even eager and the next moment he and i were alone together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i opened up in castiron german he responded in quite flexible english thereafter we gave the german language a permanent rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i visited him every day and we talked about everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least about everything but wives and children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let anybodys wife or anybodys child be mentioned and three things always followed the most gracious and loving and tender light glimmered in the mans eyes for a moment faded out the next and in its place came that deadly look which had flamed there the first time i ever saw his lids unclose thirdly he ceased from speech there and then for that day lay silent abstracted and absorbed apparently heard nothing that i said took no notice of my goodbyes and plainly did not know by either sight or hearing when i left the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i had been this karl ritters daily and sole intimate during two months i have never given up until now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made up my mind last night that it must be and very soon too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you say you are going to revisit your river byandbye when you find opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well that together with a certain strange experience which fell to my lot last night determines me to tell you my historyfor you will see napoleon arkansas and for my sake you will stop there and do a certain thing for me a thing which you will willingly undertake after you shall have heard my narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us shorten the story wherever we can for it will need it being long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you already know how i came to go to america and how i came to settle in that lonely region in the south <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you do not know that i had a wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wife was young beautiful loving and oh so divinely good and blameless and gentle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and our little girl was her mother in miniature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one nightit was toward the close of the wari woke up out of a sodden lethargy and found myself bound and gagged and the air tainted with chloroform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think dear uncle she says that the stars must be in error <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it not possible that the comet may have put em out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stars says the old gentleman couldnt make a mistake if they tried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emma he says to the other young lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same day that makes your cousin mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grig will unite you to the gifted mooney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the news as to the identity of the body lying now in almayers compound spread rapidly over the settlement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the forenoon most of the inhabitants remained in the long street discussing the mysterious return and the unexpected death of the man who had become known to them as the trader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his arrival during the northeast monsoon his long sojourn in their midst his sudden departure with his brig and above all the mysterious appearance of the body said to be his amongst the logs were subjects to wonder at and to talk over and over again with undiminished interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mahmat moved from house to house and from group to group always ready to repeat his tale how he saw the body caught by the sarong in a forked log how mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almayer coming one of the first at his cries recognised it even before he had it hauled on shore how babalatchi ordered him to bring it out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the feet i dragged him in and there was no head exclaimed mahmat and how could the white mans wife know who it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a witch it was well known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and did you see how the white man himself ran away at the sight of the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here mahmat imitated almayers long strides to the great joy of the beholders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for all his trouble he had nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ring with the green stone tuan babalatchi kept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spat down at his feet in sign of disgust and left that group to seek further on a fresh audience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the news spreading to the furthermost parts of the settlement found out abdulla in the cool recess of his godown where he sat overlooking his arab clerks and the men loading and unloading the upcountry canoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reshid who was busy on the jetty was summoned into his uncles presence and found him as usual very calm and even cheerful but very much surprised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rumour of the capture or destruction of dains brig had reached the arabs ears three days before from the seafishermen and through the dwellers on the lower reaches of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been passed upstream from neighbour to neighbour till bulangi whose clearing was nearest to the settlement had brought that news himself to abdulla whose favour he courted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but rumour also spoke of a fight and of dains death on board his own vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now all the settlement talked of dains visit to the rajah and of his death when crossing the river in the dark to see almayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but abdulla after the first shock of surprise with the old ages dislike for solving riddles showed a becoming resignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remarked that the man was dead now at all events and consequently no more dangerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where was the use to wonder at the decrees of fate especially if they were propitious to the true believers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with a pious ejaculation to allah the merciful the compassionate abdulla seemed to regard the incident as closed for the present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lingered by his uncle pulling thoughtfully his neatly trimmed beard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has been dead once before and came to life to die again now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dutch will be here before many days and clamour for the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall i not believe my eyes sooner than the tongues of women and idle men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say that the body is being taken to almayers compound said abdulla <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you want to go there you must go before the dutch arrive here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it should not be said that we have been seen inside that mans enclosure lately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reshid assented to the truth of this last remark and left his uncles side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaned against the lintel of the big doorway and looked idly across the courtyard through the open gate on to the main road of the settlement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it lay empty straight and yellow under the flood of light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the hot noontide the smooth trunks of palm trees the outlines of the houses and away there at the other end of the road the roof of almayers house visible over the bushes on the dark background of forest seemed to quiver in the heat radiating from the steaming earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> swarms of yellow butterflies rose and settled to rise again in short flights before reshids halfclosed eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from under his feet arose the dull hum of insects in the long grass of the courtyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from one of the side paths amongst the houses a woman stepped out on the road a slight girlish figure walking under the shade of a large tray balanced on its head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the consciousness of something moving stirred reshids halfsleeping senses into a comparative wakefulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he recognised taminah bulangis slavegirl with her tray of cakes for salean apparition of daily recurrence and of no importance whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he roused himself up and ran towards the gate calling out taminah o <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl stopped reshid waited signing to her impatiently to come nearer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when near reshid taminah stood with downcast eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reshid looked are you going to almayers house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say in the settlement that dain the trader he that was found drowned this morning is lying in the white mans campong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard this talk whispered taminah and this morning by the riverside i saw the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where it is now i do not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls lips quivered and she remained silent for a while breathing quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen him not a long time ago she said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then the report of the gun fired on board the steam launch was heard interrupting reshids reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leaving the girl he ran to the house and met in the courtyard abdulla coming towards the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the orang blanda are come said reshid and now we shall have our reward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white mens rewards are long in coming he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white men are quick in anger and slow in gratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one notices here and there a spike of bloom and a day later the whole field royal and ruffling lightly to the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> part of the charm of the lupine is the continual stir of its plumes to airs not suspected otherwhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go and stand by any crown of bloom and the tall stalks do but rock a little as for drowsiness but look off across the field and on the stillest days there is always a trepidation in the purple patches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from midsummer until frost the prevailing note of the field is clear gold passing into the rusty tone of bigelovia going into a decline a succession of color schemes more admirably managed than the transformation scene at the theatre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under my window a colony of cleome made a soft web of bloom that drew me every morning for a long still time and one day i discovered that i was looking into a rare fretwork of fawn and straw colored twigs from which both bloom and leaf had gone and i could not say if it had been for a matter of weeks or days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time to plant cucumbers and set out cabbages may be set down in the almanac but never seedtime nor blossom in naboths field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certain winged and mailed denizens of the field seem to reach their heyday along with the plants they most affect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in june the leaning towers of the white milkweed are jeweled over with red and gold beetles climbing dizzily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is that milkweed from whose stems the indians flayed fibre to make snares for small game but what use the beetles put it to except for a displaying ground for their gay coats i could never discover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white butterfly crop comes on with the bigelovia bloom and on warm mornings makes an airy twinkling all across the field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in september young linnets grow out of the rabbitbrush in the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the nests discoverable in the neighboring orchards will not account for the numbers of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somewhere by the same secret process by which the field matures a million more seeds than it needs it is maturing redhooded linnets for their devouring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the purlieus of bigelovia and artemisia are noisy with them for a month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly as they come as suddenly go the flybynights that pitch and toss on dusky barred wings above the field of summer twilights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never one of these nighthawks will you see after linnet time though the hurtle of their wings makes a pleasant sound across the dusk in their season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for two summers a great redtailed hawk has visited the field every afternoon between three and four oclock swooping and soaring with the airs of a gentleman adventurer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he finds there is chiefly conjectured so secretive are the little people of naboths field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only when leaves fall and the light is low and slant one sees the long clean flanks of the jackrabbits leaping like small deer and of late afternoons little cottontails scamper in the runways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the most one sees of the burrowers gophers and mice is the fresh earthwork of their newly opened doors or the pitiful small shreds the butcherbird hangs on spiny shrubs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a still field this of my neighbors though so busy and admirably compounded for variety and pleasantnessa little sand a little loam a grassy plot a stony rise or two a full brown stream a little touch of humanness a footpath trodden out by moccasins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naboth expects to make town lots of it and his fortune in one and the same day but when i take the trail to talk with old seyavi at the campoodie it occurs to me that though the field may serve a good turn in those days it will hardly be happier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the professor gave a great start at this almost reluctant suggestion shrinking back with a look which fell not far short of being horrified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then he rallied forcing a laugh before speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all conditions are lacking to form the mirage of the desert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and too everything was so distinct and clearly outlined that one could fairly feel those blessed bowarrows tickling a fellow in the short ribs vigorously declared the younger gillespie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got boys andand girls among em i wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answered featherwit scarcely realising what words were being shaped by his lips while bruno broke into a brieflived laugh more at that halfsheepish expression than at the query itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both boys and girls galore i expect kid but you neednt borrow trouble on either score <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can outrun the lads while as for the fairer sexwell theyll take precious good care to keep well beyond your reachespecially if you wear such another fascinating grin as oh you go to thunder bruno gillespie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through all this interchange the airship was maintaining a wide sweep drawing nearer the forest beneath if only to keep hidden from the eyes of the strange people in yonder deep valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet the gaze of phaeton featherwit as a rule kept turned towards that particular point his eyes on fire his lips twitching his whole demeanour that of one who feels a discovery of tremendous importance lies just before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> queried bruno taking note of that preoccupation which might easily prove dangerous under existing circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that question served to recall the professor to more material points and after a keen sweeping look around he nodded assent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes as soon as i can discover or secure a fair chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish to see morei must secure a fairer view of theof yonder place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not for us especially uncle but for the aerostat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if these be not the people you imagine they are past all doubt a remnant of the ancient aztecs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yonder lies the true lost city and we areoh try to comprehend all that statement means my lads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> picture to yourselves what boundless fame and unlimited credit awaits our report to the outer world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thethe while well form the upsotted world or a portion of it without something is doneand that in a howling hurry too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fairly spluttered waldo as the again neglected airship sped swiftly towards a more elevated portion of that earth part of the tall hillcrest which acted as natures barricade to yonder by nature depressed valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time enough lad time enough since we are going to land coolly assured the professor deftly manipulating the steeringgear and still curying around those treecrowned hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we are really hunted after twill naturally be in the quarter of our vanishment while by alighting around yonder nearly at right angles with our initial approach we will have naught to fear from thethe aztecan clans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clearly the professor had settled in his own mind just what lay before them and nothing short of the lost city of the aztecs would come anywhere near satisfying that exalted ideal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and taking all points into full consideration was there anything so very absurd in his method of reasoning or of drawing a deduction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still that exaltation did not prevent uncle phaeton from taking all essential precautions and it was only when an especially secure landingplace was sighted that he really attempted to touch the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fully onehalf of that wide circuit had been made and as nothing could be detected to give birth to fears for either self or airship the aeronauts skilfully landed their vessel with only the slightest of jars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a wellscreened location where naught could be seen of the flyingmachine until close at hand yet so arranged as to make a hasty flight a very easy matter should the occasion ever arise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not until the landing was effected and all made secure did professor featherwit speak again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it was with gravely earnest speech which suitably affected his nephews <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above all things my dear lads bear ever in mind this one factwe are not here to fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we do not come as conquerors weapons in hand hearts filled with lust of blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the contrary we are on a peaceful mission hoping to learn trusting to enlighten with malice towards none but honest love for all those who may wear the human shape be they of our own colour ororotherwise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say uncle phaeton is it just a lielow here until yonder fellows grow tired of looking for what they cant find then a flight on our part or will we have we voyaged so far and seen so much to rest content with so very little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the professor hardly as precise of speech as under ordinary conditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yonder lies the greatest discovery of the nineteenth century and we areget a hustle on boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day is waning and with so much to see to study tocome i say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of his initial attempt to impress his nephews with a due sense of the heavy responsibilities which rested upon them phaeton featherwit was far more excited than either one of the brothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless he more nearly appreciated the importance of this wondrous discovery provided his now firm belief was correctthat yonder stood a solid substantial city erected by the hands of a people whom common consent had agreed were long since wiped out of existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the story told by cooper edgecombe backed up by the articles taken from the person of the warrior whom he had slain in selfdefence certainly had its weight while the brief and imperfect glimpse which he had won of yonder valley helped to bear out that astounding belief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now i longed to see and know a great deal more about him and hoped that he might not go to heaven for at least a week or more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however he was too good for this world as we say of all people who leave it and i verily believe his heart was not a bad one after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evil he had done no doubt as evil had been done to him yet how many have done evil while receiving only good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be that as it may and not vexing a question settled for ever without our votes let us own that he was at least a brave and courteous gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and his loss aroused great lamentation not among the doones alone and the women they had carried off but also of the general public and many even of the magistrates for several miles round exmoor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this not only from fear lest one more wicked might succeed him as appeared indeed too probable but from true admiration of his strong will and sympathy with his misfortunes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not deceive any one by saying that sir ensor doone gave in so many words his consent to my resolve about lorna <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this he never did except by his speech last written down from which as he mentioned grandchildren a lawyer perhaps might have argued it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not but what he may have meant to bestow on us his blessing only that he died next day without taking the trouble to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called indeed for his box of snuff which was a very high thing to take and which he never took without being in very good humour at least for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and though it would not go up his nostrils through the failure of his breath he was pleased to have it there and not to think of dying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked him very softly for the brown appearance of it spoiled to my idea his white mostacchio but he seemed to shake his head and i thought it kept his spirits up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had never before seen any one do what all of us have to do some day and it greatly kept my spirits down although it did not so very much frighten me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it takes a man but a little while his instinct being of death perhaps at least as much as of life which accounts for his slaying his fellow men so and every other creature it does not take a man very long to enter into another mans death and bring his own mood to suit it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knows that his own is sure to come and nature is fond of the practice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence it came to pass that i after easing my mothers fears and seeing a little to business returned as if drawn by a polar needle to the deathbed of sir ensor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was some little confusion people wanting to get away and people trying to come in from downright curiosity of all things the most hateful and others making great todo and talking of their own time to come telling their own age and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but every one seemed to think or feel that i had a right to be there because the women took that view of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for carver and counsellor they were minding their own affairs so as to win the succession and never found it in their business at least so long as i was there to come near the dying man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he for his part never asked for any one to come near him not even a priest nor a monk or friar but seemed to be going his own way peaceful and well contented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the chief of the women said that from his face she believed and knew that he liked to have me at one side of his bed and lorna upon the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an hour or two ere the old man died when only we two were with him he looked at us both very dimly and softly as if he wished to do something for us but had left it now too late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorna hoped that he wanted to bless us but he only frowned at that and let his hand drop downward and crooked one knotted finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wants something out of the bed dear lorna whispered to me see what it is upon your side i followed the bent of his poor shrunken hand and sought among the pilings and there i felt something hard and sharp and drew it forth and gave it to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it flashed like the spray of a fountain upon us in the dark winter of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not take it in his hand but let it hang as daisies do only making lorna see that he meant her to have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorna cried in great surprise my necklace he always promised me and from which you have got the ring john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but grandfather kept it because the children wanted to pull it from my neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not unless darling lorna wept again because the old man could not tell her except by one very feeble nod that she was doing what he wished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she gave to me the trinket for the sake of safety and i stowed it in my breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to me to follow this and to be well content with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before sir ensor doone was buried the greatest frost of the century had set in with its iron hand and step of stone on everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how it came is not my business nor can i explain it because i never have watched the skies as people now begin to do when the ground is not to their liking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though of all this i know nothing and less than nothing i may say because i ought to know something i can hear what people tell me and i can see before my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strong men broke three good pickaxes ere they got through the hard brown sod streaked with little maps of gray where old sir ensor was to lie upon his back awaiting the darkness of the judgmentday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in the little chapelyard i will not tell the name of it because we are now such protestants that i might do it an evil turn only it was the little place where lornas aunt sabina lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was i remaining long with a little curiosity because some people told me plainly that i must be damned for ever by a papist funeral and here came lorna scarcely breathing through the thick of stuff around her yet with all her little breath steaming on the air like frost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood apart from the ceremony in which of course i was not entitled either by birth or religion to bear any portion and indeed it would have been wiser in me to have kept away altogether for now there was no one to protect me among those wild and lawless men and both carver and the counsellor had vowed a fearful vengeance on me as i heard from gwenny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had not dared to meddle with me while the chief lay dying nor was it in their policy for a short time after that to endanger their succession by an open breach with lorna whose tender age and beauty held so many of the youths in thrall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ancient outlaws funeral was a grand and moving sight more perhaps from the sense of contrast than from that of fitness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to see those dark and mighty men inured to all of sin and crime reckless both of man and god yet now with heads devoutly bent clasped hands and downcast eyes following the long black coffin of their common ancestor to the place where they must join him when their sum of ill was done and to see the feeble priest chanting over the dead form words the living would have laughed at sprinkling with his little broom drops that could not purify while the children robed in white swung their smoking censers slowly over the cold and twilight grave and after seeing all to ask with a shudder unexpressed is this the end that god intended for a man so proud and not a tear was shed upon him except from the sweetest of all sweet eyes not a sigh pursued him home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> except in hot anger his life had been cold and bitter and distant and now a week had exhausted all the sorrow of those around him a grief flowing less from affection than fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aged men will show his tombstone mothers haste with their infants by it children shrink from the name upon it until in time his history shall lapse and be forgotten by all except the great judge and god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all was over i strode across the moors very sadly trying to keep the cold away by virtue of quick movement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a flake of snow had fallen yet all the earth was caked and hard with a dry brown crust upon it all the sky was banked with darkness hard austere and frowning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fog of the last three weeks was gone neither did any rime remain but all things had a look of sameness and a kind of furzy colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was freezing hard and sharp with a piercing wind to back it and i had observed that the holy water froze upon sir ensors coffin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing struck me with some surprise as i made off for our fireside with a strong determination to heave an ashtree up the chimneyplace and that was how the birds were going rather than flying as they used to fly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the birds were set in one direction steadily journeying westward not with any heat of speed neither flying far at once but all as if on business bound partly running partly flying partly fluttering along silently and without a voice neither pricking head nor tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this movement of the birds went on even for a week or more every kind of thrushes passed us every kind of wild fowl even plovers went away and crows and snipes and woodcocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and before half the frost was over all we had in the snowy ditches were hares so tame that we could pat them partridges that came to hand with a dry noise in their crops heathpoults making cups of snow and a few poor hopping redwings flipping in and out the hedge having lost the power to fly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the time their great black eyes set with gold around them seemed to look at any man for mercy and for comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annie took a many of them all that she could find herself and all the boys would bring her and she made a great hutch near the fire in the backkitchen chimneyplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here in spite of our old betty who sadly wanted to roast them annie kept some fifty birds with bread and milk and raw chopped meat and all the seed she could think of and lumps of rotten apples placed to tempt them in the corners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some got on and some died off and annie cried for all that died and buried them under the woodrick but i do assure you it was a pretty thing to see when she went to them in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not a bird but knew her well after one day of comforting and some would come to her hand and sit and shut one eye and look at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she used to stroke their heads and feel their breasts and talk to them and not a bird of them all was there but liked to have it done to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i do believe they would eat from her hand things unnatural to them lest she should he grieved and hurt by not knowing what to do for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them was a noble bird such as i never had seen before of very fine bright plumage and larger than a misselthrush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the hardest of all to please and yet he tried to do his best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard since then from a man who knows all about birds and beasts and fishes that he must have been a norwegian bird called in this country a roller who never comes to england but in the most tremendous winters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another little bird there was whom i longed to welcome home and protect from enemies a little bird no native to us but than any native dearer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lo in the very night which followed old sir ensors funeral such a storm of snow began as never have i heard nor read of neither could have dreamed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at what time of night it first began is more than i can say at least from my own knowledge for we all went to bed soon after supper being cold and not inclined to talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that time the wind was moaning sadly and the sky as dark as a wood and the straw in the yard swirling round and round and the cows huddling into the great cowhouse with their chins upon one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we being blinder than they i suppose and not having had a great snow for years made no preparation against the storm except that the lambing ewes were in shelter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it struck me as i lay in bed that we were acting foolishly for an ancient shepherd had dropped in and taken supper with us and foretold a heavy fall and great disaster to live stock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that he had known a frost beginning just as this had done with a black east wind after days of raw cold fog and then on the third night of the frost at this very time of year to wit on the th of december such a snow set in as killed half of the sheep and many even of the red deer and the forest ponies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was threescore years agone he said and cause he had to remember it inasmuch as two of his toes had been lost by frostnip while he dug out his sheep on the other side of the dunkery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hereupon mother nodded at him having heard from her father about it and how three men had been frozen to death and how badly their stockings came off from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the frost of remembering how the old man looked and his manner of listening to the wind and shaking his head very ominously when annie gave him a glass of schnapps i grew quite uneasy in my bed as the room got colder and colder and i made up my mind if it only pleased god not to send the snow till the morning that every sheep and horse and cow ay and even the poultry should be brought in snug and with plenty to eat and fodder enough to roast them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alas what use of mans resolves when they come a day too late even if they may avail a little when they are most punctual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the bitter morning i arose to follow out my purpose knowing the time from the force of habit although the room was so dark and gray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an odd white light was on the rafters such as i never had seen before while all the length of the room was grisly like the heart of a mouldy oatrick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went to the window at once of course and at first i could not understand what was doing outside of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it faced due east as i may have said with the walnuttree partly sheltering it and generally i could see the yard and the woodrick and even the church beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now half the lattice was quite blocked up as if plastered with gray lime and little fringes like ferns came through where the joining of the lead was and in the only undarkened part countless dots came swarming clustering beating with a soft low sound then gliding down in a slippery manner not as drops of rain do but each distinct from his neighbour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inside the iron frame which fitted not to say too comfortably and went along the stonework at least a peck of snow had entered following its own bend and fancy light as any cobweb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with some trouble and great care lest the ancient frame should yield i spread the lattice open and saw at once that not a moment must he lost to save our stock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the earth was flat with snow all the air was thick with snow more than this no man could see for all the world was snowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shut the window and dressed in haste and when i entered the kitchen not even betty the earliest of all early birds was there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i raked the ashes together a little just to see a spark of warmth and then set forth to find john fry jem slocombe and bill dadds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this was easier thought than done for when i opened the courtyard door i was taken up to my knees at once and the power of the drifting cloud prevented sight of anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however i found my way to the woodrick and there got hold of a fine ashstake cut by myself not long ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this i ploughed along pretty well and thundered so hard at john frys door that he thought it was the doones at least and cocked his blunderbuss out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john was very loth to come down when he saw the meaning of it for he valued his life more than anything else though he tried to make out that his wife was to blame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i settled his doubts by telling him that i would have him on my shoulder naked unless he came in five minutes not that he could do much good but because the other men would be sure to skulk if he set them the example <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with spades and shovels and pitchforks and a round of roping we four set forth to dig out the sheep and the poor things knew that it was high time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must have snowed most wonderfully to have made that depth of covering in about eight hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for one of master stickles men who had been out all the night said that no snow began to fall until nearly midnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here it was blocking up the doors stopping the ways and the water courses and making it very much worse to walk than in a sawpit newly used <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however we trudged along in a line i first and the other men after me trying to keep my track but finding legs and strength not up to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of all john fry was groaning certain that his time was come and sending messages to his wife and blessings to his children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all this time it was snowing harder than it ever had snowed before so far as a man might guess at it and the leaden depth of the sky came down like a mine turned upside down on us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that the flakes were so very large for i have seen much larger flakes in a shower of march while sowing peas but that there was no room between them neither any relaxing nor any change of direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> watch like a good and faithful dog followed us very cheerfully leaping out of the depth which took him over his back and ears already even in the level places while in the drifts he might have sunk to any distance out of sight and never found his way up again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however we helped him now and then especially through the gaps and gateways and so after a deal of floundering some laughter and a little swearing we came all safe to the lower meadow where most of our flock was hurdled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but behold there was no flock at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none i mean to be seen anywhere only at one corner of the field by the eastern end where the snow drove in a great white billow as high as a barn and as broad as a house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this great drift was rolling and curling beneath the violent blast tufting and combing with rustling swirls and carved as in patterns of cornice where the grooving chisel of the wind swept round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever and again the tempest snatched little whiffs from the channelled edges twirled them round and made them dance over the chime of the monster pile then let them lie like herringbones or the seams of sand where the tide has been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the while from the smothering sky more and more fiercely at every blast came the pelting pitiless arrows winged with murky white and pointed with the barbs of frost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but although for people who had no sheep the sight was a very fine one so far at least as the weather permitted any sight at all yet for us with our flock beneath it this great mount had but little charm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> watch began to scratch at once and to howl along the sides of it he knew that his charge was buried there and his business taken from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we four men set to in earnest digging with all our might and main shovelling away at the great white pile and fetching it into the meadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each man made for himself a cave scooping at the soft cold flux which slid upon him at every stroke and throwing it out behind him in piles of castled fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last we drove our tunnels in for we worked indeed for the lives of us and all converging towards the middle held our tools and listened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other men heard nothing at all or declared that they heard nothing being anxious now to abandon the matter because of the chill in their feet and knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i said go if you choose all of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will work it out by myself you piecrusts and upon that they gripped their shovels being more or less of englishmen and the least drop of english blood is worth the best of any other when it comes to lasting out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before we began again i laid my head well into the chamber and there i hears a faint maaah coming through some ells of snow like a plaintive buried hope or a last appeal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouted aloud to cheer him up for i knew what sheep it was to wit the most valiant of all the wethers who had met me when i came home from london and been so glad to see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then we all fell to again and very soon we hauled him out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> watch took charge of him at once with an air of the noblest patronage lying on his frozen fleece and licking all his face and feet to restore his warmth to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then fighting tom jumped up at once and made a little butt at watch as if nothing had ever ailed him and then set off to a shallow place and looked for something to nibble at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> further in and close under the bank where they had huddled themselves for warmth we found all the rest of the poor sheep packed as closely as if they were in a great pie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was strange to observe how their vapour and breath and the moisture exuding from their wool had scooped as it were a coved room for them lined with a ribbing of deep yellow snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also the churned snow beneath their feet was as yellow as gamboge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two or three of the weaklier hoggets were dead from want of air and from pressure but more than threescore were as lively as ever though cramped and stiff for a little while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john fry asked in great dismay when we had cleared about a dozen of them which we were forced to do very carefully so as not to fetch the roof down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no manner of maning to you see to this place john i replied as we leaned on our shovels a moment and the sheep came rubbing round us let no more of them out for the present they are better where they be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> watch here boy keep watch came with his little scut of a tail cocked as sharp as duty and i set him at the narrow mouth of the great snow antre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the sheep sidled away and got closer that the other sheep might be bitten first as the foolish things imagine whereas no good sheepdog even so much as lips a sheep to turn it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then of the outer sheep all now snowed and frizzled like a lawyers wig i took the two finest and heaviest and with one beneath my right arm and the other beneath my left i went straight home to the upper sheppey and set them inside and fastened them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sixty and six i took home in that way two at a time on each joumey and the work grew harder and harder each time as the drifts of the snow were deepening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no other man should meddle with them i was resolved to try my strength against the strength of the elements and try it i did ay and proved it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain fierce delight burned in me as the struggle grew harder but rather would i die than yield and at last i finished it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people talk of it to this day but none can tell what the labour was who have not felt that snow and wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the sheep upon the mountain and the sheep upon the western farm and the cattle on the upper barrows scarcely one in ten was saved do what we would for them and this was not through any neglect now that our wits were sharpened but from the pure impossibility of finding them at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that great snow never ceased a moment for three days and nights and then when all the earth was filled and the topmost hedges were unseen and the trees broke down with weight wherever the wind had not lightened them a brilliant sun broke forth and showed the loss of all our customs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all our house was quite snowed up except where we had purged a way by dint of constant shovellings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kitchen was as dark and darker than the cidercellar and long lines of furrowed scollops ran even up to the chimneystacks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several windows fell right inwards through the weight of the snow against them and the few that stood bulged in and bent like an old bruised lanthorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were obliged to cook by candlelight we were forced to read by candlelight as for baking we could not do it because the oven was too chill and a load of faggots only brought a little wet down the sides of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for when the sun burst forth at last upon that world of white what he brought was neither warmth nor cheer nor hope of softening only a clearer shaft of cold from the violet depths of sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> longdrawn alleys of white haze seemed to lead towards him yet such as he could not come down with any warmth remaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> broad white curtains of the frostfog looped around the lower sky on the verge of hill and valley and above the laden trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only round the sun himself and the spot of heaven he claimed clustered a bright purpleblue clear and calm and deep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night such a frost ensued as we had never dreamed of neither read in ancient books or histories of frobisher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kettle by the fire froze and the crock upon the hearthcheeks many men were killed and cattle rigid in their headropes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i heard that fearful sound which never i had heard before neither since have heard except during that same winter the sharp yet solemn sound of trees burst open by the frostblow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our great walnut lost three branches and has been dying ever since though growing meanwhile as the soul does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the ancient oak at the cross was rent and many score of ash trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people who have not seen it as i have will only make faces and disbelieve till such another frost comes which perhaps may never be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this terrible weather kept tom faggus from coming near our house for weeks at which indeed i was not vexed a quarter so much as annie was for i had never half approved of him as a husband for my sister in spite of his purchase from squire bassett and the grant of the royal pardon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be however that annie took the same view of my love for lorna and could not augur well of it but if so she held her peace though i was not so sparing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for many things contributed to make me less goodhumoured now than my real nature was and the very least of all these things would have been enough to make some people cross and rude and fractious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean the red and painful chapping of my face and hands from working in the snow all day and lying in the frost all night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for being of a fair complexion and a ruddy nature and pretty plump withal and fed on plenty of hot victuals and always forced by my mother to sit nearer the fire than i wished it was wonderful to see how the cold ran revel on my cheeks and knuckles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i feared that lorna if it should ever please god to stop the snowing might take this for a proof of low and rustic blood and breeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this i say was the smallest thing for it was far more serious that we were losing half our stock do all we would to shelter them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the horses in the stables mustered all together for the sake of breath and steaming had long icicles from their muzzles almost every morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of all things the very gravest to my apprehension was the impossibility of hearing or having any token of or from my loved one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then we came upon the merchants quarters where men live over their storehouses that do traffic with the people over seas and then down an open space there glittered before us a mirror of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now here thought i this mad beast will come to sudden stop and as like as not will swerve round sharply and charge back again towards the heart of the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i braced myself to withstand the shock and took fresh grip upon the woman who lay against my breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but with louder screams and wilder trumpetings the mammoth held straight on and presently came to the harbours edge and sent the spray sparkling in sheets amongst the sunshine as it went with its clumsy gait into the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at this point the pace was very quickly slackened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great sewers which science devised for the health of the city in the old kings time vomit their drainings into this part of the harbour and the solid matter which they carry is quickly deposited as an impalpable sludge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into this the huge beast began to sink deeper and deeper before it could halt in its rush and when with frightened bellowings it had come to a stop it was bogged irretrievably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madly it struggled wildly it screamed and trumpeted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harbourwater and the slime were churned into one stinking compost and the golden castle in which we clung lurched so wildly that we were torn from it and shot far away into the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still there of course we were safe and i was pleased enough to be rid of the bumpings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you handle yourself like a sore man deucalion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i owe you something for lending me the cushion of your body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres more of the gallant about you when it comes to the test than one would guess to hear you talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i warrant it came to you as a new experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should have sworn that with me in your arms you could have wished the bumping had gone on for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deucalion hail me those fools in that boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell them that if they hurt so much as a hair of my mammoth ill kill them all by torture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell exhaust himself directly and when his flurrys done well leave him where he is to consider his evil ways for a day or so and then haul him out with windlasses and tame him afresh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not feel myself to be phorenice if i had no fine red shaggy mammoth to take me out for my rides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boat was a tenslave galley which was churning up from the farther side of the harbour as hard as wellplied whips could make oars drive her but at the sound of my shouts the soldiers on her foredeck stopped their arrowshots and the steersman swerved her off on a new course to pick us up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> till then we had been swimming leisurely across an angle of the harbour so as to avoid landing where the sewers outpoured but we stopped now treading the water and were helped over the side by most respectful hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the galley belonged to the captain of the port a mincing figure of a mariner whose highest appetite in life was to lick the feet of the great and he began to fawn and prostrate himself at once and to wish that his eyes had been blinded before he saw the empress in such deadly peril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its nothing mortal that will ever kill me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have spoiled my pretty clothes and shed a jewel or two and thats annoying enough as you say good man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the silly fellow repeated a wish that he might be blinded before the empress was ever put to such discomfort again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it seemed she could be cloyed with flattery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are tired of your eyes said she let me tell you that you have gone the way to have them plucked out from their sockets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kill my mammoth would you because he has shown himself a trifle frolicsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and your sort want more education my man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall have to teach you that portcaptains and such small creatures are very easy to come by and very small value when got but that my mammoth is minemine do you understand?the property of goddess phorenice and as such is sacred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am an ignorant fellow said he and heaven was robbed of its brightest ornament when phorenice came down to atlantis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if reparation is permitted me i have two prisoners in the cabin of the boat here who shall be sacrificed to the mammoth forthwith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless it would please him to make sport with them and spill out the last lees of his rage upon their bodies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under cover of last night they were trying to pass in between the two forts which guard the harbour mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but their boat fouled the chain and by the light of the torches the sentries spied them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were caught with ropes and put in a dungeon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is an order not to abuse prisoners before they have been brought before a judgment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did these prisoners offer to buy their lives with news <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed i think he got his deathwound in being taken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the woman fought like a cat also so they said in the fort but she was caught without hurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she says she has got nothing that would be of use to tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she says she has tired of living like a savage outside the city and moreover that inside there is a man for whose nearness she craves most mightily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is this a romance we have swum to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see what affectionate creatures we women are deucalion.the galley was brought up against the royal quay and made fast to its golden rings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i handed the empress ashore but she turned again and faced the boat her garments still yielding up a slender drip of water.produce your woman prisoner master captain and let us see whether she is a runaway wife or a lovesick girl mad after her sweetheart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i will deliver judgment on her and as like as not will surprise you all with my clemency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am in a mood for tender romance today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the portcaptain went into the little hutch of a cabin with a white face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was plain that phorenices pleasantries scared him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man appears to be dead your majesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see that his wounds bring out the woman you fool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw the fellow stoop for his knife to cut a lashing and presently who should he bring out to the daylight but the girl i had saved from the cavetigers in the circus and who had so strangely drawn me to her during the hours that we had spent afterwards in companionship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was clear too that the empress recognised her also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed she made no secret about the matter addressing her by name and mockingly making inquiries about the menage of the rebels and the success of the prisoners amours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this good portcaptain tells me that you made a most valiant attempt to return nais and for an excuse you told that it was your love for some man in the city here which drew you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come now we are willing to overlook much of your faults if you will give us a reasonable chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> point me out your man and if he is a proper fellow i will see that he weds you honestly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes and i will do more for you nais since this day brings me to a husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing that all your estate is confiscate as a penalty for your late rebellion i will charge myself with your dowry and give it back to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl looked at her with a sullen brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spoke a lie she said there is no man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady doubtless spoke what came to her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a woman is in the grip of a rude soldiery any excuse which can save her for the moment must serve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for myself i should think it like enough that she would confess to having come back to her old allegiance if she were asked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any interest you may show in this matter will go far to offend me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have spoken of nais in your narrative before and although your tongue was shrewd and you did not say much i am a woman and i could read between the lines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now regard my rebel i have no wish to be unduly hard upon you though once you were my fangirl and so your running away to these illkempt malcontents who beat their heads against my city walls is all the more naughty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> point me out the man you would wed and he shall be your husband tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why my pretty nais not ten months ago there were a score who would have leaped at the chance of having you for a wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drop your coyness girl and name me one of those <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i warrant you that i will be your ambassadress and will put the matter to him with such delicacy that he will not make you blush by refusal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a maiden and i have a maidens modesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will die as you choose but i will not do this indecency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i am a maiden too and though because i am empress also questions of state have to stand before questions of my private modesty i can have a sympathy for yoursalthough in truth it did not obtrude unduly when you were my fangirl nais <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great broken bough upon the grass showed whence he had gained his leverage to tilt over our bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the face had vanished but presently it was up again more frantic than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we nearly killed you with a stone at the cave he cried but this is better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your bones will whiten up there and none will know where you lie or come to cover them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as you lie dying think of lopez whom you shot five years ago on the putomayo river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am his brother and come what will i will die happy now for his memory has been avenged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a furious hand was shaken at us and then all was quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had the halfbreed simply wrought his vengeance and then escaped all might have been well with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was that foolish irresistible latin impulse to be dramatic which brought his own downfall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roxton the man who had earned himself the name of the flail of the lord through three countries was not one who could be safely taunted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the halfbreed was descending on the farther side of the pinnacle but before he could reach the ground lord john had run along the edge of the plateau and gained a point from which he could see his man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a single crack of his rifle and though we saw nothing we heard the scream and then the distant thud of the falling body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roxton came back to us with a face of granite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been a blind simpleton said he bitterly its my folly that has brought you all into this trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have remembered that these people have long memories for bloodfeuds and have been more upon my guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took two of them to lever that tree over the edge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could have shot him but i let him go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may have had no part in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it would have been better if i had killed him for he must as you say have lent a hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that we had the clue to his action each of us could cast back and remember some sinister act upon the part of the halfbreedhis constant desire to know our plans his arrest outside our tent when he was overhearing them the furtive looks of hatred which from time to time one or other of us had surprised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were still discussing it endeavoring to adjust our minds to these new conditions when a singular scene in the plain below arrested our attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man in white clothes who could only be the surviving half breed was running as one does run when death is the pacemaker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind him only a few yards in his rear bounded the huge ebony figure of zambo our devoted negro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even as we looked he sprang upon the back of the fugitive and flung his arms round his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an instant afterwards zambo rose looked at the prostrate man and then waving his hand joyously to us came running in our direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white figure lay motionless in the middle of the great plain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our two traitors had been destroyed but the mischief that they had done lived after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by no possible means could we get back to the pinnacle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had been natives of the world now we were natives of the plateau <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the plain which led to the canoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yonder beyond the violet hazy horizon was the stream which led back to civilization <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no human ingenuity could suggest a means of bridging the chasm which yawned between ourselves and our past lives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one instant had altered the whole conditions of our existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was at such a moment that i learned the stuff of which my three comrades were composed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were grave it is true and thoughtful but of an invincible serenity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the moment we could only sit among the bushes in patience and wait the coming of zambo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently his honest black face topped the rocks and his herculean figure emerged upon the top of the pinnacle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a question which it was easier to ask than to answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was our one trusty link with the outside world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already they say too much curupuri live on this place and they go home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you leave them me no able to keep them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a fact that our indians had shown in many ways of late that they were weary of their journey and anxious to return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we realized that zambo spoke the truth and that it would be impossible for him to keep them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> make them wait till tomorrow zambo i shouted then i can send letter back by them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i promise they wait till tomorrow said the negro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was plenty for him to do and admirably the faithful fellow did it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first of all under our directions he undid the rope from the treestump and threw one end of it across to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not thicker than a clothesline but it was of great strength and though we could not make a bridge of it we might well find it invaluable if we had any climbing to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then fastened his end of the rope to the package of supplies which had been carried up and we were able to drag it across <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gave us the means of life for at least a week even if we found nothing else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he descended and carried up two other packets of mixed goodsa box of ammunition and a number of other things all of which we got across by throwing our rope to him and hauling it back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was evening when he at last climbed down with a final assurance that he would keep the indians till next morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it is that i have spent nearly the whole of this our first night upon the plateau writing up our experiences by the light of a single candlelantern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we supped and camped at the very edge of the cliff quenching our thirst with two bottles of apollinaris which were in one of the cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is vital to us to find water but i think even lord john himself had had adventures enough for one day and none of us felt inclined to make the first push into the unknown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we forbore to light a fire or to make any unnecessary sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow or today rather for it is already dawn as i write we shall make our first venture into this strange land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i shall be able to write againor if i ever shall write againi know not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile i can see that the indians are still in their place and i am sure that the faithful zambo will be here presently to get my letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only trust that it will come to hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had reason for fears which it was not possible for them to express <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the night drew on the fears took stronger form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they forgot the existence of the rat who sat biting his nails in the bedroom afraid to go out lest he might lose the chance of being given some errand to do but also afraid to show himself lest he should seem in the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill stay upstairs he had said to lazarus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you just the anguish he passed through as the day went by and lazarus went out and came in and he himself received no orders could not have been expressed in any ordinary words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he writhed in his chair he bit his nails to the quick he wrought himself into a frenzy of misery and terror by recalling one by one all the crimes his knowledge of london policecourts supplied him with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was doing nothing yet he dare not leave his post <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was his post after all though they had not given it to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle of the night loristan opened the door of the back sittingroom because he knew he must at least go upstairs and throw himself upon his bed even if he could not sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rat was sitting huddled on the floor near it with his back against the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a piece of paper in his hand and his twisted face was a weird thing to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew youd have to come out sometime and i thought youd let me speak to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you come into the room said loristan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will listen to anything you want to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what have you been drawing on that paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the rat got up in the wonderful way he had taught himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the paper was covered with lines which showed it to be another of his plans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i darent go out lest you might want to send me somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put down all the streets and squares he might have walked through on his way home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youll let me start out and walk through every one of them and talk to the policemen on the beat and look at the housesand think out things and work at themill not miss an inchill not miss a brick or a flagstoneill his voice had a hard sound but it shook and he himself shook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is well for us that may i go now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this moment if you are ready was the answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loristan said to him a thing which was like the sudden lighting of a great light in the very center of his being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that i know you are doing this i may even sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was because he was following this plan that the rat had turned into brandon terrace and heard the samavian song ringing out from the locked basement of number yes he is one of us loristan said when he told this part of the story to marco as they sat by the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last night i saw into from that day the rat held a new place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lazarus himself strangely enough did not resent his holding it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy was allowed to be near loristan as he had never dared to hope to be near <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not merely that he was allowed to serve him in many ways but he was taken into the intimacy which had before enclosed only the three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loristan talked to him as he talked to marco drawing him within the circle which held so much that was comprehended without speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rat knew that he was being trained and observed and he realized it with exaltation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his idol had said that he was one of them and he was watching and putting him to tests so that he might find out how much he was one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he was doing it for some grave reason of his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps he was wondering if he should find out that he was to be trusted as a rock is to be trusted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he should even think that perhaps he might find that he was like a rock was inspiration enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir he said one night when they were alone together because the rat had been copying a roadmap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his voice was very low do you think thatsometimeyou could trust me as you trust the time has come and loristans voice was almost as low as his own though strong and deep feeling underlay its quiet the time has come when i can trust you with marcoto be his companionto care for him to stand by his side at any moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was enough to uplift the rat to the skies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may not be long before it may be his part to do work in which he will need a comrade who can be trustedas a rock can be he had said the very words the rats own mind had given to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve seen that theyre as good as legs havent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave him a gracious smile which seemed as if it held a sort of fine secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it shall be he had always encouraged the game and during the last weeks had even found time to help them in their plannings for the mysterious journey of the secret two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been so interested that once or twice he had called on lazarus as an old soldier and samavian to give his opinions of certain routesand of the customs and habits of people in towns and villages by the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here they would find simple pastoral folk who danced sang after their days work and who would tell all they knew here they would find those who served or feared the maranovitch and who would not talk at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one place they would meet with hospitality in another with unfriendly suspicion of all strangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through talk and stories the rat began to know the country almost as marco knew it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was part of the game toobecause it was always the game they called it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another part was the rats training of his memory and bringing home his proofs of advance at night when he returned from his walk and could describe or recite or roughly sketch all he had seen in his passage from one place to another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marcos part was to recall and sketch faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loristan one night gave him a number of photographs of people to commit to memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under each face was written the name of a place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> learn these faces he said until you would know each one of them at once wheresoever you met it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fix them upon your mind so that it will be impossible for you to forget them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must be able to sketch any one of them and recall the city or town or even this was still called the game but marco began to know in his secret heart that it was so much more that his hand sometimes trembled with excitement as he made his sketches over and over again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make each one many times was the best way to imbed it in his memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rat knew too though he had no reason for knowing but mere instinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he used to lie awake in the night and think it over and remember what loristan had said of the time coming when marco might need a comrade in his work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was to be something like the game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and though marco often lay awake on his bed when the rat lay awake on his sofa neither boy spoke to the other of the thing his mind dwelt on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and marco worked as he had never worked before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the game was very exciting when he could prove his prowess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the four gathered together at night in the back sittingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lazarus was obliged to be with them because a second judge was needed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loristan would mention the name of a place perhaps a street in paris or a hotel in vienna and marco would at once make a rapid sketch of the face under whose photograph the name of the locality had been written <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not long before he could begin his sketch without more than a moments hesitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet even when this had become the case they still played the game night after night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a great hotel near the place de la concorde in paris of which marco felt he should never hear the name during all his life without there starting up before his mental vision a tall woman with fierce black eyes and a delicate highbridged nose across which the strong eyebrows almost met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vienna there was a palace which would always bring back at once a pale coldfaced man with a heavy blonde lock which fell over his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain street in munich meant a stout genial old aristocrat with a sly smile a village in bavaria a peasant with a vacant and simple countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a curled and smoothed man who looked like a hairdresser brought up a place in an austrian mountain town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew them all as he knew his own face and no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still night after night the game was played <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came a night when out of a deep sleep he was awakened by lazarus touching him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had so long been secretly ready to answer any call that he sat up straight in bed at the first touch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dress quickly and come down stairs lazarus said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marco made no answer but got out of bed and began to slip on his clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rat was as ready as marco and sat upright as he had done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come down with the young master he commanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is necessary that you should be seen and spoken to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and having given the order he went away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one heard the shoeless feet of the two boys as they stole down the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an elderly man in ordinary clothes but with an unmistakable face was sitting quietly talking to loristan who with a gesture called both forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you will not fly into a passion people know you are stronger than they are because you are strong enough to hold in your rage and they are not and they say stupid things they wish they hadnt said afterward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres nothing so strong as rage except what makes you hold it inthats stronger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a good thing not to answer your enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps emily is more like me than i am like myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps she would rather not answer her friends even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but though she tried to satisfy herself with these arguments she did not find it easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when after a long hard day in which she had been sent here and there sometimes on long errands through wind and cold and rain she came in wet and hungry and was sent out again because nobody chose to remember that she was only a child and that her slim legs might be tired and her small body might be chilled when she had been given only harsh words and cold slighting looks for thanks when the cook had been vulgar and insolent when miss minchin had been in her worst mood and when she had seen the girls sneering among themselves at her shabbinessthen she was not always able to comfort her sore proud desolate heart with fancies when emily merely sat upright in her old chair and stared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these nights when she came up to the attic cold and hungry with a tempest raging in her young breast emilys stare seemed so vacant her sawdust legs and arms so inexpressive that sara lost all control over herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nobody but emily no one in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall die presently she said at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant bear this said the poor child trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im cold im wet im starving to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive walked a thousand miles today and they have done nothing but scold me from morning until night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and because i could not find that last thing the cook sent me for they would not give me any supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some men laughed at me because my old shoes made me slip down in the mud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at the staring glass eyes and complacent face and suddenly a sort of heartbroken rage seized her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lifted her little savage hand and knocked emily off the chair bursting into a passion of sobbingsara who never cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emily lay on the floor with her legs ignominiously doubled up over her head and a new flat place on the end of her nose but she was calm even dignified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rats in the wall began to fight and bite each other and squeak and scramble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so unlike her to break down that she was surprised at herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a while she raised her face and looked at emily who seemed to be gazing at her round the side of one angle and somehow by this time actually with a kind of glassyeyed sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she even smiled at herself a very little smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant help being a doll she said with a resigned sigh any more than lavinia and jessie can help not having any sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she kissed her and shook her clothes straight and put her back upon her chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had wished very much that some one would take the empty house next door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wished it because of the attic window which was so near hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed as if it would be so nice to see it propped open someday and a head and shoulders rising out of the square aperture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it looked a nice head she thought i might begin by saying good morning and all sorts of things might happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of course its not really likely that anyone but under servants would sleep there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one morning on turning the corner of the square after a visit to the grocers the butchers and the bakers she saw to her great delight that during her rather prolonged absence a van full of furniture had stopped before the next house the front doors were thrown open and men in shirt sleeves were going in and out carrying heavy packages and pieces of furniture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i do hope a nice head will look out of the attic window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would almost have liked to join the group of loiterers who had stopped on the pavement to watch the things carried in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had an idea that if she could see some of the furniture she could guess something about the people it belonged to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss minchins tables and chairs are just like her she thought i remember thinking that the first minute i saw her even though i was so little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told papa afterward and he laughed and said it was true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure the large family have fat comfortable armchairs and sofas and i can see that their redflowery wallpaper is exactly like them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its warm and cheerful and kindlooking and happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was sent out for parsley to the greengrocers later in the day and when she came up the area steps her heart gave quite a quick beat of recognition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several pieces of furniture had been set out of the van upon the pavement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a beautiful table of elaborately wrought teakwood and some chairs and a screen covered with rich oriental embroidery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight of them gave her a weird homesick feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had seen things so like them in india <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the things miss minchin had taken from her was a carved teakwood desk her father had sent her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are beautiful things she said they look as if they ought to belong to a nice person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vans of furniture came and were unloaded and gave place to others all the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several times it so happened that sara had an opportunity of seeing things carried in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it became plain that she had been right in guessing that the newcomers were people of large means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the furniture was rich and beautiful and a great deal of it was oriental <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wonderful rugs and draperies and ornaments were taken from the vans many pictures and books enough for a library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among other things there was a superb god buddha in a splendid shrine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> someone in the family must have been in india sara thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have got used to indian things and like them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall feel as if they were friends even if a head never looks out of the attic window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she was taking in the evenings milk for the cook there was really no odd job she was not called upon to do she saw something occur which made the situation more interesting than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the handsome rosy man who was the father of the large family walked across the square in the most matteroffact manner and ran up the steps of the nextdoor house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ran up them as if he felt quite at home and expected to run up and down them many a time in the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stayed inside quite a long time and several times came out and gave directions to the workmen as if he had a right to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite certain that he was in some intimate way connected with the newcomers and was acting for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the new people have children sara speculated the large family children will be sure to come and play with them and they might come up into the attic just for fun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you have the happiness of bestowing your sweet little catherine some years hence on a man who in connection and character is alike unexceptionable you will know what i feel now though thank heaven you cannot have all my reasons for rejoicing in such an event <end> <end> 
<start> <start> catherine will be amply provided for and not like my frederica indebted to a fortunate establishment for the comforts of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave them somewhat awkwardly i believe for in fact the sudden disclosure of so important a matter took from me the power of speaking with any clearness she thanked me however most affectionately for my kind concern in the welfare of herself and daughter and then said i am not apt to deal in professions my dear mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vernon and i never had the convenient talent of affecting sensations foreign to my heart and therefore i trust you will believe me when i declare that much as i had heard in your praise before i knew you i had no idea that i should ever love you as i now do and i must further say that your friendship towards me is more particularly gratifying because i have reason to believe that some attempts were made to prejudice you against me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only wish that they whoever they are to whom i am indebted for such kind intentions could see the terms on which we now are together and understand the real affection we feel for each other but i will not detain you any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god bless you for your goodness to me and my girl and continue to you all your present happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what can one say of such a woman my dear mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet i cannot help suspecting the truth of everything she says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for reginald i believe he does not know what to make of the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when sir james came he appeared all astonishment and perplexity the folly of the young man and the confusion of frederica entirely engrossed him and though a little private discourse with lady susan has since had its effect he is still hurt i am sure at her allowing of such a mans attentions to her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir james invited himself with great composure to remain here a few dayshoped we would not think it odd was aware of its being very impertinent but he took the liberty of a relation and concluded by wishing with a laugh that he might be really one very soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even lady susan seemed a little disconcerted by this forwardness in her heart i am persuaded she sincerely wished him gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but something must be done for this poor girl if her feelings are such as both i and her uncle believe them to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must not be sacrificed to policy or ambition and she must not be left to suffer from the dread of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl whose heart can distinguish reginald de courcy deserves however he may slight her a better fate than to be sir james martins wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i can get her alone i will discover the real truth but she seems to wish to avoid me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope this does not proceed from anything wrong and that i shall not find out i have thought too well of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her behaviour to sir james certainly speaks the greatest consciousness and embarrassment but i see nothing in it more like encouragement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is your business she answered quite snappishly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well said the prince and catching her up in his arms he sprang with her from the rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they came to the surface she found that for a moment or two she could not even laugh for she had gone down with such a rush that it was with difficulty she recovered her breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the instant how do you like falling in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes answered the prince i should think it a very tolerable specimen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me like going up rejoined she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my feeling was certainly one of elevation too the prince conceded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the princess did not appear to understand him for she retorted his how do you like falling in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond everything answered he for i have fallen in with the only perfect creature i ever saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no more of that i am tired of it said the princess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beginning to recover his temper at about this point mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodchild voluntarily reported that if you wanted to be primitive you could be primitive here and that if you wanted to be idle you could be idle here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the course of some days he added that there were three fishingboats but no rigging and that there were plenty of fishermen who never fished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that they got their living entirely by looking at the ocean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what nourishment they looked out of it to support their strength he couldnt say but he supposed it was some sort of iodine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place was full of their children who were always upside down on the public buildings two small bridges over the brook and always hurting themselves or one another so that their wailings made more continual noise in the air than could have been got in a busy place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the houses people lodged in were nowhere in particular and were in capital accordance with the beach being all more or less cracked and damaged as its shells were and all empty as its shells were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among them was an edifice of destitute appearance with a number of walleyed windows in it looking desperately out to scotland as if for help which said it was a bazaar and it ought to know and where you might buy anything you wanted supposing what you wanted was a little campstool or a childs wheelbarrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brook crawled or stopped between the houses and the sea and the donkey was always running away and when he got into the brook he was pelted out with stones which never hit him and which always hit some of the children who were upside down on the public buildings and made their lamentations louder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this donkey was the public excitement of allonby and was probably supported at the public expense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foregoing descriptions delivered in separate items on separate days of adventurous discovery mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodchild severally wound up by looking out of window looking in again and saying there were fine sunsets at allonby when the low flat beach with its pools of water and its dry patches changed into long bars of silver and gold in various states of burnishing and there were fine views on fine days of the scottish coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when it rained at allonby allonby thrown back upon its ragged self became a kind of place which the donkey seemed to have found out and to have his highly sagacious reasons for wishing to bolt from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodchild with a noble show of disinterestedness became every day more ready to walk to maryport and back for letters and suspicions began to harbour in the mind of thomas that his friend deceived him and that maryport was a preferable place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore thomas said to francis on a day when they had looked at the sea and eaten the shrimps my mind misgives me goodchild that you go to maryport like the boy in the storybook to ask it judge then returned francis adopting the style of the story book with what success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go to a region which is a bit of waterside bristol with a slice of wapping a seasoning of wolverhampton and a garnish of portsmouth and i say will you come and be idle with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it answers no for i am a great deal too vaporous and a great deal too rusty and a great deal too muddy and a great deal too dirty altogether and i have ships to load and pitch and tar to boil and iron to hammer and steam to get up and smoke to make and stone to quarry and fifty other disagreeable things to do and i cant be idle with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i go into jagged uphill and downhill streets where i am in the pastrycooks shop at one moment and next moment in savage fastnesses of moor and morass beyond the confines of civilisation and i say to those murky and blackdusty streets will you come and be idle with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to which they reply no we cant indeed for we havent the spirits and we are startled by the echo of your feet on the sharp pavement and we have so many goods in our shop windows which nobody wants and we have so much to do for a limited public which never comes to us to be done for that we are altogether out of sorts and cant enjoy ourselves with any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i go to the postoffice and knock at the shutter and i say to the postmaster will you come and be idle with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about nine oclock next morning i set off to the house of the armenian i had never called upon him so early before and certainly never with a heart beating with so much eagerness but the situation of my affairs had become very critical and i thought that i ought to lose no time in informing the armenian that i was at length perfectly willing either to translate the haik esop under his superintendence or to accept a seat at the desk opposite to the moldavian clerk and acquire the secrets of armenian commerce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a quick step i entered the countingroom where notwithstanding the earliness of the hour i found the clerk busied as usual at his desk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had always appeared to me a singular being this same moldavian clerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a person of fewer words could scarcely be conceived provided his master were at home he would on my inquiring nod his head and provided he were not he would invariably reply with the monosyllable no delivered in a strange guttural tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the present occasion being full of eagerness and impatience i was about to pass by him to the apartment above without my usual inquiry when he lifted his head from the ledger in which he was writing and laying down his pen motioned to me with his forefinger as if to arrest my progress whereupon i stopped and with a palpitating heart demanded whether the master of the house was at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moldavian clerk replied with his usual guttural and opening his desk ensconced his head therein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it does not much matter said i i suppose i shall find him at i was turning away with the intention of leaving the room at this moment however the head of the moldavian clerk became visible and i observed a letter in his hand which he had inserted in the desk at the same time with his head this he extended towards me making at the same time a sidelong motion with his head as much as to say that it contained something which interested me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took the letter and the moldavian clerk forthwith resumed his occupation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the back of the letter bore my name written in armenian characters with a trembling hand i broke the seal and unfolding the letter i beheld several lines also written in the letters of mesroub the cadmus of the armenians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stared at the lines and at first could not make out a syllable of their meaning at last however by continued staring i discovered that though the letters were armenian the words were english in about ten minutes i had contrived to decipher the sense my dear friend the words which you uttered in our last conversation have made a profound impression upon me i have thought them over day and night and have come to the conclusion that it is my bounden duty to attack the persians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when these lines are delivered to you i shall be on the route to ararat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mercantile speculation will be to the world the ostensible motive of my journey and it is singular enough that one which offers considerable prospect of advantage has just presented itself on the confines of persia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think not however that motives of lucre would have been sufficiently powerful to tempt me to the east at the present moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may speculate it is true but i should scarcely have undertaken the journey but for your pungent words inciting me to attack the persians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubt not that i will attack them on the first opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thank you heartily for putting me in mind of my duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have hitherto to use your own words been too fond of moneygetting like all my countrymen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am much for some time after i had deciphered the epistle i stood as if rooted to the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt stunned my last hope was gone presently a feeling arose in my mind a feeling of selfreproach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whom had i to blame but myself for the departure of the armenian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would he have ever thought of attacking the persians had i not put the idea into his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had told me in his epistle that he was indebted to me for the idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for that he might at the present moment have been in london increasing his fortune by his usual methods and i might be commencing under his auspices the translation of the haik esop with the promise no doubt of a considerable remuneration for my trouble or i might be taking a seat opposite the moldavian clerk and imbibing the first rudiments of doing business after the armenian fashion with the comfortable hope of realising in a short time a fortune of three or four hundred thousand pounds but the armenian was now gone and farewell to the fine hopes i had founded upon him the day before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked wildly around till my eyes rested on the moldavian clerk who was writing away in his ledger with particular vehemence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not knowing well what to do or to say i thought i might as well ask the moldavian clerk when the armenian had departed and when he thought that he would return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true it mattered little to me when he departed seeing that he was gone and it was evident that he would not be back soon but i knew not what to do and in pure helplessness thought i might as well ask so i went up to the moldavian clerk and asked him when the armenian had departed and whether he had been gone two days or three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon the moldavian clerk looking up from his ledger made certain signs which i could by no means understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood astonished but presently recovering myself inquired when he considered it probable that the master would return and whether he thought it would be two months or my tongue faltered two years whereupon the moldavian clerk made more signs than before and yet more unintelligible as i persisted however he flung down his pen and putting his thumb into his mouth moved it rapidly causing the nail to sound against the lower jaw whereupon i saw that he was dumb and hurried away for i had always entertained a horror of dumb people having once heard my another say when i was a child that dumb people were half demoniacs or little better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kind of stupor peace of god divine hand farewell child the fair massive edifice battered tars lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leaving the house of the armenian i strolled about for some time almost mechanically my feet conducted me to london bridge to the booth in which stood the stall of the old applewoman the sound of her voice aroused me as i sat in a kind of stupor on the stone bench beside her she was inquiring what was the matter with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first i believe i answered her very incoherently for i observed alarm beginning to depict itself upon her countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rousing myself however i in my turn put a few questions to her upon her present condition and prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old womans countenance cleared up instantly she informed me that she had never been more comfortable in her life that her trade her honest trade laying an emphasis on the word honest had increased of late wonderfully that her health was better and above all that she felt no fear and horror here laying her hand on her breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on my asking her whether she still heard voices in the night she told me that she frequently did but that the present were mild voices sweet voices encouraging voices very different from the former ones that a voice only the night previous had cried out about the peace of god in particularly sweet accents a sentence which she remembered to have read in her early youth in the primer but which she had clean forgotten till the voice the night before brought it to her recollection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a pause the old woman said to me i believe dear that it is the blessed book you brought me which has wrought this goodly change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how glad i am now that i can read but oh what a difference between the book you brought to me and the one you took away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe the one you brought is written by the finger of dont abuse the book said i it is an excellent book for those who can understand it it was not exactly suited to you and perhaps it had been better that you had never read it and yet who knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peradventure if you had not read that book you would not have been fitted for the perusal of the one which you say is written by the finger of god and pressing my hand to my head i fell into a deep fit of musing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what after all thought i if there should be more order and system in the working of the moral world than i have thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does there not seem in the present instance to be something like the working of a divine hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not conceive why this woman better educated than her mother should have been as she certainly was a worse character than her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet perhaps this woman may be better and happier than her mother ever was perhaps she is so already perhaps this world is but the thought of my own situation did not permit me to abandon myself much longer to these musings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then stay here child said she i have much to say to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said i i shall be better moving about and i was moving away when it suddenly occurred to me that i might never see this woman again and turning round i offered her my hand and bade her goodbye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farewell child said the old woman and god bless you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then moved along the bridge until i reached the southwark side and still holding on my course my mind again became quickly abstracted from all surrounding objects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length i found myself in a street or road with terraces on either side and seemingly of interminable length leading as it would appear to the southeast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was walking at a great rate there were likewise a great number of people also walking at a great rate also carts and carriages driving at a great rate and all men carts and carriages going in the selfsame direction namely to the southeast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stopped for a moment and deliberated whether or not i should proceed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not say that i had any particular business in that direction but what could i do were i to turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only walk about wellknown streets and if i must walk why not continue in the direction in which i was to see whither the road and its terraces led <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was ere in a terra incognita and an unknown place had always some interest for me moreover i had a desire to know whither all this crowd was going and for what purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought they could not be going far as crowds seldom go far especially at such a rate so i walked on more lustily than before passing group after group of the crowd and almost vying in speed with some of the carriages especially the hackneycoaches and by dint of walking at this rate the terraces and houses becoming somewhat less frequent as i advanced i reached in about threequarters of an hour a kind of low dingy town in the neighbourhood of the river the streets were swarming with people and i concluded from the number of wildbeast shows caravans gingerbread stalls and the like that a fair was being held <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now as i had always been partial to fairs i felt glad that i had fallen in with the crowd which had conducted me to the present one and casting away as much as i was able all gloomy thoughts i did my best to enter into the diversions of the fair staring at the wonderful representations of animals on canvas hung up before the shows of wild beasts which by the bye are frequently found much more worthy of admiration than the real beasts themselves listening to the jokes of the merryandrews from the platforms in front of the temporary theatres or admiring the splendid tinsel dresses of the performers who thronged the stages in the intervals of the entertainments and in this manner occasionally gazing and occasionally listening i passed through the town till i came in front of a large edifice looking full upon the majestic bosom of the thames <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a massive stone edifice built in an antique style and black with age with a broad esplanade between it and the river on which mixed with a few people from the fair i observed moving about a great many individuals in quaint dresses of blue with strange threecornered hats on their heads most of them were mutilated this had a wooden leg this wanted an arm some had but one eye and as i gazed upon the edifice and the singularlooking individuals who moved before it i guessed where i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am at said i these individuals are battered tars of old england and this edifice once the favourite abode of glorious elizabeth is the refuge which a grateful country has allotted to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here they can rest their weary bodies at their ease talk over the actions in which they have been injured and with the tear of enthusiasm flowing from their eyes boast how they have trod the deck of fame with rodney or nelson or others whose names stand turning to the right i entered a park or wood consisting of enormous trees occupying the foot sides and top of a hill which rose behind the town there were multitudes of people among the trees diverting themselves in various ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> coming to the top of the hill i was present y stopped by a lofty wall along which i walked till coming to a small gate i passed through and found myself on an extensive green plain on one side bounded in part by the wall of the park and on the others in the distance by extensive ranges of houses to the southeast was a lofty eminence partially clothed with wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plain exhibited an animated scene a kind of continuation of the fair below there were multitudes of people upon it many tents and shows there was also horseracing and much noise and shouting the sun shining brightly overhead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after gazing at the horseracing for a little time feeling myself somewhat tired i went up to one of the tents and laid myself down on the grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said a voice with a slight tendency to lisp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was a sound as of a piece of money banging on a table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried several voices and then the banging down of the money and the lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were frequently repeated at last the second voice exclaimed i will try no more you have cheated me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never cheated any one in my life my lord all fair all chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> them that finds wins them that cant finds loses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then it appeared that some other lord tried for i heard more money flung down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then again the sound of money and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once or twice but not more i heard won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last there was a considerable hubbub and the words cheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were used freely by more voices than one to which the voice with the tendency to lisp replied never filched a pea in my life would scorn it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> always glad when folks wins but as those here dont appear to be civil not to wish to play any more i shall take myself off with my table so singular table no money out of employ my bonnet we of the thimble good wages wisely resolved strangest way in the world fat gentleman not such another first edition not very easy wont close avella gorgio alarmed look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently a man emerged from the tent bearing before him a rather singular table it appeared to be of white deal was exceedingly small at the top and with very long legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at a few yards from the entrance he paused and looked round as if to decide on the direction which he should take presently his eye glancing on me as i lay upon the ground he started and appeared for a moment inclined to make off as quick as possible table and all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment however he seemed to recover assurance and coming up to the place where i was the long legs of the table projecting before very fine my lord will your lordship play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill soon teach you said he placing the table down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all you have to do is to put a sovereign down on my table and to find the pea which i put under one of my thimbles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you find it and it is easy enough to find it i give you a and them that dont finds loses said i no i dont wish to oh you have no money that of course alters the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you have no money you cant play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i suppose i must be seeing after my customers said he glancing over the plain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodday said the man slowly but without moving and as if in reflection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a moment or two looking at me inquiringly he the man measured me with his eye as i lay on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length as many as you please said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then just come a little out of hearing a little farther on the why do you call me my lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i as i arose and followed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we of the thimble always calls our customers lords said the man the man walked along the plain till he came to the side of a dry pit when looking round to see that no one was nigh he laid his table on the grass and sitting down with his legs over the side of the pit he motioned me to do the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he after i had sat down beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however no wonder as you had never heard of the thimble and pea game but i will tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we of the game are very much exposed folks when they have lost their money as those who play with us mostly do sometimes uses rough language calls us cheats and sometimes knocks our hats over our eyes and whats more with a kick under our table cause the top deals to fly off this is the third table i have used this day the other two being broken by uncivil customers so we of the game generally like to have gentlemen go about with us to take our part and encourage us though pretending to know nothing about us for example when the customer says im cheated the bonnet must say no you aint it is all right or when my hat is knocked over my eyes the bonnet must square and say i never saw the man before in all my life but i wont see him illused and so when they kicks at the table the bonnet must say i wont see the table illused such a nice table too besides i want to play myself and then i would say to the bonnet thank you my lord them that finds wins and in a word said i the bonnet means the man who covers you even i just so said the man i see you are awake and would soon is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bonnet is cant said the man we of the thimble as well as all clyfakers and the like understand cant as of course must every bonnet so if you are employed by me you had better learn it as soon as you can that we may discourse together without being understood by every one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides covering his principal a bonnet must have his eyes about him for the trade of the pea though a strictly honest one is not altogether lawful so it is the duty of the bonnet if he sees the constable coming to say the gorgios that is not cant said i that is the language of the rommany do you know those people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i did said the man i would give ten pounds and more to know the language of the rommany chals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres some of it in the language of the pea and thimble how it came there i dont know but so it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i knew it but it is difficult <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why to a firstrate bonnet as i think you would prove i could is it possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> firstrate said i bonneting is more profitable than anan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or translating i dont think the armenian would have paid me at who is he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i know what that is esops cant for a hunchback but you should know said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe the saurians were an orthodox tribe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you stop yonder to ponder the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at me earnestly and then gave a tug at the bridle for his steed was inclined to make a crude repast from the bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how was it that i did not detect you at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house and so they did in many things but the quiet scholar sitting among his books was still the head of the family the household conscience anchor and comforter for to him the busy anxious women always turned in troublous times finding him in the truest sense of those sacred words husband and father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls gave their hearts into their mothers keeping their souls into their fathers and to both parents who lived and labored so faithfully for them they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> march is as brisk and cheery though rather grayer than when we saw her last and just now so absorbed in megs affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded boys and soldiers widows decidedly miss the motherly missionarys visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john brooke did his duty manfully for a year got wounded was sent home and not allowed to return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he received no stars or bars but he deserved them for he cheerfully risked all he had and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perfectly resigned to his discharge he devoted himself to getting well preparing for business and earning a home for meg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him he refused mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laurences more generous offers and accepted the place of bookkeeper feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting growing womanly in character wise in housewifely arts and prettier than ever for love is a great beautifier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had her girlish ambitions and hopes and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned moffat had just married sallie gardiner and meg couldnt help contrasting their fine house and carriage many gifts and splendid outfit with her own and secretly wishing she could have the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor john had put into the little home awaiting her and when they sat together in the twilight talking over their small plans the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot sallies splendor and felt herself the richest happiest girl in christendom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jo never went back to aunt march for the old lady took such a fancy to amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going and for the sake of this advantage amy would have served a far harder mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she gave her mornings to duty her afternoons to pleasure and prospered finely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jo meantime devoted herself to literature and beth who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not an invalid exactly but never again the rosy healthy creature she had been yet always hopeful happy and serene and busy with the quiet duties she loved everyones friend and an angel in the house long before those who loved her most had learned to know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as the spread eagle paid her a dollar a column for her rubbish as she called it jo felt herself a woman of means and spun her little romances diligently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript which was one day to place the name of march upon the roll of fame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laurie having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a universal favorite thanks to money manners much talent and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them he stood in great danger of being spoiled and probably would have been like many another promising boy if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son and last but not least by any means the knowledge that four innocent girls loved admired and believed in him with all their hearts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being only a glorious human boy of course he frolicked and flirted grew dandified aquatic sentimental or gymnastic as college fashions ordained hazed and was hazed talked slang and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks he always managed to save himself by frank confession honorable atonement or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors dignified professors and vanquished enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men of my class were heroes in the eyes of the girls who never wearied of the exploits of our fellows and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures when laurie brought them home with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amy especially enjoyed this high honor and became quite a belle among them for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular john to care for any other lords of creation and beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how amy dared to order them about so but jo felt quite in her own element and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes phrases and feats which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all liked jo immensely but never fell in love with her though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at amys shrine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the dovecote <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the name of the little brown house mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laurie had christened it saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who went on together like a pair of turtledoves with first a bill and then a coo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a tiny house with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here meg meant to have a fountain shrubbery and a profusion of lovely flowers though just at present the fountain was represented by a weatherbeaten urn very like a dilapidated slopbowl the shrubbery consisted of several young larches undecided whether to live or die and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but inside it was altogether charming and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be sure the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano for one never could have been got in whole the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pellmell into the coalbin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing and the result was highly satisfactory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no marbletopped tables long mirrors or lace curtains in the little parlor but simple furniture plenty of books a fine picture or two a stand of flowers in the bay window and scattered all about the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think the parian psyche laurie gave lost any of its beauty because john put up the bracket it stood upon that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than amys artistic hand or that any storeroom was ever better provided with good wishes merry words and happy hopes than that in which jo and her mother put away megs few boxes barrels and bundles and i am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute mis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters holders and piece bags for beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them and meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table was eloquent of home love and tender forethought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what happy times they had planning together what solemn shopping excursions what funny mistakes they made and what shouts of laughter arose over lauries ridiculous bargains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his love of jokes this young gentleman though nearly through college was a much of a boy as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new useful and ingenious article for the young housekeeper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now a bag of remarkable clothespins next a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt laborsaving soap that took the skin off ones hands infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer and every kind of tinware from a toy savings bank for odd pennies to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john laughed at him and jo called him mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was possessed with a mania for patronizing yankee ingenuity and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything was done at last even to amys arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms and beths setting the table for the first meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does it seem like home and do you feel as if you should be happy here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> march as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes mother perfectly satisfied thanks to you all and so happy that i cant talk about it with a look that was far better than words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she only had a servant or two it would be all right said amy coming out of the parlor where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mother and i have talked that over and i have made up my mind to try her way first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there will be so little to do that with lotty to run my errands and help me here and there i shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick answered meg tranquilly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if meg had four the house wouldnt hold them and master and missis would have to camp in the garden broke in jo who enveloped in a big blue pinafore was giving the last polish to the door handles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sallie isnt a poor mans wife and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg and john begin humbly but i have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a great mistake for young girls like meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress give orders and gossip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i was first married i used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn so that i might have the pleasure of mending them for i got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why didnt you go into the kitchen and make messes as sallie says she does to amuse herself though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her said meg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did after a while not to mess but to learn of hannah how things should be done that my servants need not laugh at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was play then but there came a time when i was truly grateful that i not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls and help myself when i could no longer afford to hire help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you begin at the other end meg dear but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you byandby when john is a richer man for the mistress of a house however splendid should know how work ought to be done if she wishes to be well and honestly served <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes mother im sure of that said meg listening respectfully to the little lecture for the best of women will hold forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know i like this room most of all in my baby house added meg a minute after as they went upstairs and she looked into her wellstored linen closet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beth was there laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all three laughed as meg spoke for that linen closet was a joke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see having said that if meg married that brooke she shouldnt have a cent of her money aunt march was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carrol florences mamma was ordered to buy have made and marked a generous supply of house and table linen and send it as her present all of which was faithfully done but the secret leaked out and was greatly enjoyed by the family for aunt march tried to look utterly unconscious and insisted that she could give nothing but the oldfashioned pearls long promised to the first bride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a housewifely taste which i am glad to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> march patting the damask tablecloths with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent a single finger bowl but this is a setout that will last me all my days hannah says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and meg looked quite contented as well she might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a tall broadshouldered young fellow with a cropped head a felt basin of a hat and a flyaway coat came tramping down the road at a great pace walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate straight up to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> march with both hands out and a hearty here i am mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed as usual with a motherly kiss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john brooke with the makers congratulations and compliments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amy you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as laurie spoke he delivered a brown paper parcel to meg pilled beths hair ribbon stared at jos bib pinafore and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before amy then shook hands all round and everyone began to talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stopped to get the license for tomorrow maam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired jo who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> undo the bundle and see meg said beth eying the knobby parcel with curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves observed laurie as a watchmans rattle appeared amid the laughter of the girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any time when john is away and you get frightened mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg just swing that out of the front window and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw it going into your house as i came by and if she hadnt defended it manfully id have had a pick at it for it looked like a remarkably plummy one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder if you will ever grow up laurie said meg in a matronly tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im doing my best maam but cant get much higher im afraid as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days responded the young gentleman whose head was about level with the little chandelier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spickandspan bower so as im tremendously hungry i propose an adjournment he added presently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mother and i are going to wait for john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some last things to settle said meg bustling away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beth and i are going over to kitty bryants to get more flowers for tomorrow added amy tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls and enjoying the effect as much as anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im in such a state of exhaustion i cant get home without help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont take off your apron whatever you do its peculiarly becoming said laurie as jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now teddy i want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow began jo as they strolled away together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must promise to behave well and not cut up any pranks and spoil our plans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dont say funny things when we ought to be sober <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i implore you not to look at me during the ceremony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wont see me youll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never cry unless for some great affliction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say jo how is grandpa this week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why have you got into a scrape and want to know how hell take it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now jo do you think id look your mother in the face and say all right if it wasnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and laurie stopped short with an injured air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only want some money said laurie walking on again appeased by her hearty tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless you i dont spend it it spends itself somehow and is gone before i know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are so generous and kindhearted that you let people borrow and cant say no to anyone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we heard about henshaw and all you did for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you always spent money in that way no one would blame you said jo warmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh he made a mountain out of a molehill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wouldnt have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps would you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course not but i dont see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats endless neckties and a new hat every time you come home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which is always a tremendous task dear friendsa mammoth task <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cowardly lions eyes now flashed fire he crouched low and lashed the ground with his tail and gazed around to discover who the treacherous magician might be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but kiki who had kept his face in the hollow rock again whispered the magic word and the great lion disappeared and in his place stood a little boy dressed in munchkin costume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little munchkin boy was as angry as the lion had been but he was small and helpless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruggedo the nome saw what was happening and was afraid kiki would spoil all his plans so he leaned over the rock and shouted stop kikistop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead he transformed the nome into a goose to ruggedos horror and dismay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the hungry tiger had witnessed all these transformations and he was watching to see which of those present was to blame for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when ruggedo spoke to kiki the hungry tiger knew that he was the magician so he made a sudden spring and hurled his great body full upon the form of the limoneag crouching against the rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kiki didnt see the tiger coming because his face was still in the hollow and the heavy body of the tiger bore him to the earth just as he said pyrzqxgl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so now the tiger which was crushing him changed to a rabbit and relieved of its weight kiki sprang up and spreading his eagles wings flew into the branches of a tree where no beast could easily reach him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not an instant too quick in doing this for gugu the king had crouched on the rocks edge and was about to spring on the boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from his tree kiki transformed gugu into a fat gillikin woman and laughed aloud to see how the woman pranced with rage and how astonished all the beasts were at their kings new shape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beasts were frightened too fearing they would share the fate of gugu so a stampede began when rango the gray ape sprang into the forest and bru the bear and loo the unicorn followed as quickly as they could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elephants backed into the forest and all the other animals big and little rushed after them scattering through the jungles until the clearing was far behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the monkeys scrambled into the trees and swung themselves from limb to limb to avoid being trampled upon by the bigger beasts and they were so quick that they distanced all the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a panic of fear seemed to have overtaken the forest people and they got as far away from the terrible magician as they possibly could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the transformed ones stayed in the clearing being so astonished and bewildered by their new shapes that they could only look at one another in a dazed and helpless fashion although each one was greatly annoyed at the trick that had been played on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the munchkin boy asked the rabbit and who are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fox asked the lamb and who are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im the cowardly lion said the munchkin boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im gugu the king said the fat woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when they asked the goose who he was ruggedo the nome would not tell them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im just a goose he replied and what i was before i cannot remember <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kiki aru in the form of the limoneag had scrambled into the high thick branches of the tree so no one could see him and there he opened the wizards black bag which he had carried away in his flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was curious to see what the wizards magic tools looked like and hoped he could use some of them and so secure more power but after he had taken the articles one by one from the bag he had to admit they were puzzles to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for unless he understood their uses they were of no value whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kiki aru the hyup boy was no wizard or magician at all and could do nothing unusual except to use the magic word he had stolen from his father on mount munch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he hung the wizards black bag on a branch of the tree and then climbed down to the lower limbs that he might see what the victims of his transformations were doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i fight with a familiar or the ghost of a fencer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres blood that would have served me these seven years in broken heads and cut fingers and now it runs out all togethermiddleton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prince john sat down impatiently before arlingford castle in the hope of starving out the besieged but finding the duration of their supplies extend itself in an equal ratio with the prolongation of his hope he made vigorous preparations for carrying the place by storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he constructed an immense machine on wheels which being advanced to the edge of the moat would lower a temporary bridge of which one end would rest on the bank and the other on the battlements and which being well furnished with stepping boards would enable his men to ascend the inclined plane with speed and facility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda received intimation of this design by the usual friendly channel of a blunt arrow which must either have been sent from some secret friend in the princes camp or from some vigorous archer beyond it the latter will not appear improbable when we consider that robin hood come scrive turpino che non erra <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the machine was completed and the ensuing morning fixed for the assault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six men relieved at intervals kept watch over it during the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prince john retired to sleep congratulating himself in the expectation that another day would place the fair culprit at his princely mercy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his anticipations mingled with the visions of his slumber and he dreamed of wounds and drums and sacking and firing the castle and bearing off in his arms the beautiful prize through the midst of fire and smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the height of this imaginary turmoil he awoke and conceived for a few moments that certain sounds which rang in his ears were the continuation of those of his dream in that sort of halfconsciousness between sleeping and waking when reality and phantasy meet and mingle in dim and confused resemblance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was however very soon fully awake to the fact of his guards calling on him to arm which he did in haste and beheld the machine in flames and a furious conflict raging around it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hurried to the spot and found that his camp had been suddenly assailed from one side by a party of foresters and that the barons people had made a sortie on the other and that they had killed the guards and set fire to the machine before the rest of the camp could come to the assistance of their fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was in itself intensely dark and the firelight shed around it a vivid and unnatural radiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one side the crimson light quivered by its own agitation on the waveless moat and on the bastions and buttresses of the castle and their shadows lay in massy blackness on the illuminated walls on the other it shone upon the woods streaming far within among the open trunks or resting on the closer foliage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the circumference of darkness bounded the scene on all sides and in the centre raged the war shields helmets and bucklers gleaming and glittering as they rang and clashed against each other plumes confusedly tossing in the crimson light and the messy light and shade that fell on the faces of the combatants giving additional energy to their ferocious expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john drawing nearer to the scene of action observed two young warriors fighting side by side one of whom wore the habit of a forester the other that of a retainer of arlingford <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked intently on them both their position towards the fire favoured the scrutiny and the hawks eye of love very speedily discovered that the latter was the fair matilda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the forester he did not know but he had sufficient tact to discern that his success would be very much facilitated by separating her from this companion above all others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he therefore formed a party of men into a wedge only taking especial care not to be the point of it himself and drove it between them with so much precision that they were in a moment far asunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lady matilda said john yield yourself my prisoner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> supposing him ready to separate from her could she be detached from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kates anxieties when she at last hinted them to malbone only sent him further into revery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how is it he asked himself that when i only sought to love and be loved i have thus entangled myself in the fate of others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clairon complained that so soon as she became seriously attached to any one she was sure to meet somebody else whom she liked better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have human hearts he said or at least has my heart no more stability than this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did not help the matter when emilia went to stay awhile with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hope and kate had been to a dinnerparty and were as usual reciting their experiences to aunt jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was one of those dreadfully dark diningrooms said hope seating herself at the open window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do they make them look so like tombs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because said her aunt most americans pass from them to the tomb after eating such indigestible things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a wish for a gentle transition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meredith asks to have a little visit from emilia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were talking about her only a week ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it seems to me she has great length of days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is not more than forty and you are fiftyfour interrupted the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she has not seen nearly so many days as you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of her days is as long as three of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she does not tire you very often said kate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she comes once a year said aunt jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then it is not to see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she comes out of respect to the memory of my greataunt with whom talleyrand fell in love when he was in america before mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meredith kindly had blanche ingleside to stay there also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blanche stayed at different houses a good deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to do her justice she was very good company when put upon her best behavior and beyond the reach of her demure mamma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was always in spirits often goodnatured and kept everything in lively motion you may be sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she found it not unpleasant in rich houses to escape some of those little domestic parsimonies which the world saw not in her own and to secure this felicity she could sometimes lay great restraints upon herself for as much as twentyfour hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed a little out of place certainly amid the precise proprieties of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but blanche and her mother still held their place in society and it was nothing to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meredith who came to her doors but only from what other doors they came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would have liked to see all the best houses connected by secret galleries or underground passages of which she and a few others should hold the keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a guest properly presented could then go the rounds of all unerringly leaving his card at each while improper acquaintances in vain howled for admission at the outer wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the rest her ideal of social happiness was a series of perfectly ordered entertainments at each of which there should be precisely the same guests the same topics the same supper and the same ennui <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malbone stood one morning on the pier behind the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the southwest breeze rippled the deep blue water sailboats blue red and green were darting about like whitewinged butterflies sloops passed and repassed cutting the air with the white and slender points of their gafftopsails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the liberated sunbeams spread and penetrated everywhere and even came up to play reflected from the water beneath the shadowy overhanging counters of dark vessels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond the atmosphere was still busy in rolling away its vapors brushing the last gray fringes from the low hills and leaving over them only the thinnest aerial veil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do that pair of flaunting girls with the pert affected laugh and the sly leer at the bystanders intrude themselves into the same rank with yonder decorous matron and that somewhat prudish maiden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely these poor creatures born to vice as their sole and natural inheritance can be no fit associates for women who have been guarded round about by all the proprieties of domestic life and who could not err unless they first created the opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no it must be merely the impertinence of those unblushing hussies and we can only wonder how such respectable ladies should have responded to a summons that was not meant for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall make short work of this miserable class each member of which is entitled to grasp any other members hand by that vile degradation wherein guilty error has buried all alike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foul fiend to whom it properly belongs must relieve us of our loathsome task <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let the bond servants of sin pass on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but neither man nor woman in whom good predominates will smile or sneer nor bid the rogues march be played in derision of their array <end> <end> 
<start> <start> feeling within their breasts a shuddering sympathy which at least gives token of the sin that might have been they will thank god for any place in the grand procession of human existence save among those most wretched ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many however will be astonished at the fatal impulse that drags them thitherward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing is more remarkable than the various deceptions by which guilt conceals itself from the perpetrators conscience and oftenest perhaps by the splendor of its garments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> statesmen rulers generals and all men who act over an extensive sphere are most liable to be deluded in this way they commit wrong devastation and murder on so grand a scale that it impresses them as speculative rather than actual but in our procession we find them linked in detestable conjunction with the meanest criminals whose deeds have the vulgarity of petty details <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the effect of circumstance and accident is done away and a man finds his rank according to the spirit of his crime in whatever shape it may have been developed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have called the evil now let us call the good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trumpets brazen throat should pour heavenly music over the earth and the heralds voice go forth with the sweetness of an angels accents as if to summon each upright man to his reward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not one for the just the pure the true and an who might most worthily obey it shrink sadly back as most conscious of error and imperfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then let the summons be to those whose pervading principle is love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this classification will embrace all the truly good and none in whose souls there exists not something that may expand itself into a heaven both of welldoing and felicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first that presents himself is a man of wealth who has bequeathed the bulk of his property to a hospital his ghost methinks would have a better right here than his living body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here they come the genuine benefactors of their race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some have wandered about the earth with pictures of bliss in their imagination and with hearts that shrank sensitively from the idea of pain and woe yet have studied all varieties of misery that human nature can endure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prison the insane asylum the squalid chamber of the almshouse the manufactory where the demon of machinery annihilates the human soul and the cotton field where gods image becomes a beast of burden to these and every other scene where man wrongs or neglects his brother the apostles of humanity have penetrated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this missionary black with indias burning sunshine shall give his arm to a palefaced brother who has made himself familiar with the infected alleys and loathsome haunts of vice in one of our own cities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the generous founder of a college shall be the partner of a maiden lady of narrow substance one of whose good deeds it has been to gather a little school of orphan children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the mighty merchant whose benefactions are reckoned by thousands of dollars deem himself worthy let him join the procession with her whose love has proved itself by watchings at the sickbed and all those lowly offices which bring her into actual contact with disease and wretchedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with those whose impulses have guided them to benevolent actions we will rank others to whom providence has assigned a different tendency and different powers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men who have spent their lives in generous and holy contemplation for the human race those who by a certain heavenliness of spirit have purified the atmosphere around them and thus supplied a medium in which good and high things may be projected and performedgive to these a lofty place among the benefactors of mankind although no deed such as the world calls deeds may be recorded of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some individuals of whom we cannot conceive it proper that they should apply their hands to any earthly instrument or work out any definite act and others perhaps not less high to whom it is an essential attribute to labor in body as well as spirit for the welfare of their brethren <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus if we find a spiritual sage whose unseen inestimable influence has exalted the moral standard of mankind we will choose for his companion some poor laborer who has wrought for love in the potato field of a neighbor poorer than himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have summoned this various multitudeand to the credit of our nature it is a large oneon the principle of love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is singular nevertheless to remark the shyness that exists among many members of the present class all of whom we might expect to recognize one another by the freemasonry of mutual goodness and to embrace like brethren giving god thanks for such various specimens of human excellence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each sect surrounds its own righteousness with a hedge of thorns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is difficult for the good christian to acknowledge the good pagan almost impossible for the good orthodox to grasp the hand of the good unitarian leaving to their creator to settle the matters in dispute and giving their mutual efforts strongly and trustingly to whatever right thing is too evident to be mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then again though the heart be large yet the mind is often of such moderate dimensions as to be exclusively filled up with one idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a good man has long devoted himself to a particular kind of beneficenceto one species of reformhe is apt to become narrowed into the limits of the path wherein he treads and to fancy that there is no other good to be done on earth but that selfsame good to which he has put his hand and in the very mode that best suits his own conceptions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his scheme must be wrought out by the united strength of the whole worlds stock of love or the world is no longer worthy of a position in the universe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover powerful truth being the rich grape juice expressed from the vineyard of the ages has an intoxicating quality when imbibed by any save a powerful intellect and often as it were impels the quaffer to quarrel in his cups <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for such reasons strange to say it is harder to contrive a friendly arrangement of these brethren of love and righteousness in the procession of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> than to unite even the wicked who indeed are chained together by their crimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact is too preposterous for tears too lugubrious for laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but let good men push and elbow one another as they may during their earthly march all will be peace among them when the honorable array or their procession shall tread on heavenly ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they will doubtless find that they have been working each for the others cause and that every welldelivered stroke which with an honest purpose any mortal struck even for a narrow object was indeed stricken for the universal cause of good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their own view may be bounded by country creed profession the diversities of individual characterbut above them all is the breadth of providence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many who have deemed themselves antagonists will smile hereafter when they look back upon the worlds wide harvest field and perceive that in unconscious brotherhood they were helping to bind the selfsame sheaf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun is hastening westward while the march of human life that never paused before is delayed by our attempt to rearrange its order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is desirable to find some comprehensive principle that shall render our task easier by bringing thousands into the ranks where hitherto we have brought one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was exactly what sir thomas and edmund had been separately conniving at as each proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norriss continuing where she was instead of rushing out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> william and fanny soon shewed themselves and sir thomas had the pleasure of receiving in his protege certainly a very different person from the one he had equipped seven years ago but a young man of an open pleasant countenance and frank unstudied but feeling and respectful manners and such as confirmed him his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was long before fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of such an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation and the first of fruition it was some time even before her happiness could be said to make her happy before the disappointment inseparable from the alteration of person had vanished and she could see in him the same william as before and talk to him as her heart had been yearning to do through many a past year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that time however did gradually come forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her own and much less encumbered by refinement or selfdistrust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was the first object of his love but it was a love which his stronger spirits and bolder temper made it as natural for him to express as to feel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the morrow they were walking about together with true enjoyment and every succeeding morrow renewed a teteatete which sir thomas could not but observe with complacency even before edmund had pointed it out to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excepting the moments of peculiar delight which any marked or unlookedfor instance of edmunds consideration of her in the last few months had excited fanny had never known so much felicity in her life as in this unchecked equal fearless intercourse with the brother and friend who was opening all his heart to her telling her all his hopes and fears plans and solicitudes respecting that long thought of dearly earned and justly valued blessing of promotion who could give her direct and minute information of the father and mother brothers and sisters of whom she very seldom heard who was interested in all the comforts and all the little hardships of her home at mansfield ready to think of every member of that home as she directed or differing only by a less scrupulous opinion and more noisy abuse of their aunt norris and with whom perhaps the dearest indulgence of the whole all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over again and every former united pain and pleasure retraced with the fondest recollection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an advantage this a strengthener of love in which even the conjugal tie is beneath the fraternal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> children of the same family the same blood with the same first associations and habits have some means of enjoyment in their power which no subsequent connexions can supply and it must be by a long and unnatural estrangement by a divorce which no subsequent connexion can justify if such precious remains of the earliest attachments are ever entirely outlived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fraternal love sometimes almost everything is at others worse than nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but with william and fanny price it was still a sentiment in all its prime and freshness wounded by no opposition of interest cooled by no separate attachment and feeling the influence of time and absence only in its increase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who had hearts to value anything good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry crawford was as much struck with it as any <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he honoured the warmhearted blunt fondness of the young sailor which led him to say with his hands stretched towards fannys head do you know i begin to like that queer fashion already though when i first heard of such things being done in england i could not believe it and when mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brown and the other women at the commissioners at gibraltar appeared in the same trim i thought they were mad but fanny can reconcile me to anything and saw with lively admiration the glow of fannys cheek the brightness of her eye the deep interest the absorbed attention while her brother was describing any of the imminent hazards or terrific scenes which such a period at sea must supply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a picture which henry crawford had moral taste enough to value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fannys attractions increasedincreased twofold for the sensibility which beautified her complexion and illumined her countenance was an attraction in itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of her heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be something to be loved by such a girl to excite the first ardours of her young unsophisticated mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she interested him more than he had foreseen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> william was often called on by his uncle to be the talker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his recitals were amusing in themselves to sir thomas but the chief object in seeking them was to understand the reciter to know the young man by his histories and he listened to his clear simple spirited details with full satisfaction seeing in them the proof of good principles professional knowledge energy courage and cheerfulness everything that could deserve or promise well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young as he was william had already seen a great deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been in the mediterranean in the west indies in the mediterranean again had been often taken on shore by the favour of his captain and in the course of seven years had known every variety of danger which sea and war together could offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with such means in his power he had a right to be listened to and though mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norris could fidget about the room and disturb everybody in quest of two needlefuls of thread or a secondhand shirt button in the midst of her nephews account of a shipwreck or an engagement everybody else was attentive and even lady bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say dear me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder anybody can ever go to sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to henry crawford they gave a different feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he longed to have been at sea and seen and done and suffered as much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his heart was warmed his fancy fired and he felt the highest respect for a lad who before he was twenty had gone through such bodily hardships and given such proofs of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the glory of heroism of usefulness of exertion of endurance made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful contrast and he wished he had been a william price distinguishing himself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much selfrespect and happy ardour instead of what he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was roused from the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it by some inquiry from edmund as to his plans for the next days hunting and he found it was as well to be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one respect it was better as it gave him the means of conferring a kindness where he wished to oblige <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with spirits courage and curiosity up to anything william expressed an inclination to hunt and crawford could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself and with only some scruples to obviate in sir thomas who knew better than his nephew the value of such a loan and some alarms to reason away in fanny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she feared for william by no means convinced by all that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged the rough horses and mules he had ridden or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls that he was at all equal to the management of a highfed hunter in an english foxchase nor till he returned safe and well without accident or discredit could she be reconciled to the risk or feel any of that obligation to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crawford for lending the horse which he had fully intended it should produce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it was proved however to have done william no harm she could allow it to be a kindness and even reward the owner with a smile when the animal was one minute tendered to his use again and the next with the greatest cordiality and in a manner not to be resisted made over to his use entirely so long as he remained in northamptonshire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> constable printers to her majesty at the intercourse of the two families was at this period more nearly restored to what it had been in the autumn than any member of the old intimacy had thought ever likely to be again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the return of henry crawford and the arrival of william price had much to do with it but much was still owing to sir thomass more than toleration of the neighbourly attempts at the parsonage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mind now disengaged from the cares which had pressed on him at first was at leisure to find the grants and their young inmates really worth visiting and though infinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous matrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent possibilities of any one most dear to him and disdaining even as a littleness the being quicksighted on such points he could not avoid perceiving in a grand and careless way that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crawford was somewhat distinguishing his niece nor perhaps refrain though unconsciously from giving a more willing assent to invitations on that account <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his readiness however in agreeing to dine at the parsonage when the general invitation was at last hazarded after many debates and many doubts as to whether it were worth while because sir thomas seemed so ill inclined and lady bertram was so indolent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> proceeded from goodbreeding and goodwill alone and had nothing to do with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crawford but as being one in an agreeable group for it was in the course of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in the habit of such idle observations would have thought that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one being composed in a good proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen and the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful according to the usual style of the grants and too much according to the usual habits of all to raise any emotion except in mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norris who could never behold either the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience and who did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the servants behind her chair and to bring away some fresh conviction of its being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the evening it was found according to the predetermination of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grant and her sister that after making up the whisttable there would remain sufficient for a round game and everybody being as perfectly complying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist and lady bertram soon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for her own choice between the games and being required either to draw a card for whist or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whist and speculation which will amuse me most <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir thomas after a moments thought recommended speculation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a whist player himself and perhaps might feel that it would not much amuse him to have her for a partner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well was her ladyships contented answer then speculation if you please mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know nothing about it but fanny must teach me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here fanny interposed however with anxious protestations of her own equal ignorance she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life and lady bertram felt a moments indecision again but upon everybodys assuring her that nothing could be so easy that it was the easiest game on the cards and henry crawfords stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and miss price and teach them both it was so settled and sir thomas mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual state and dignity the remaining six under miss crawfords direction were arranged round the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a fine arrangement for henry crawford who was close to fanny and with his hands full of business having two persons cards to manage as well as his own for though it was impossible for fanny not to feel herself mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes he had yet to inspirit her play sharpen her avarice and harden her heart which especially in any competition with william was a work of some difficulty and as for lady bertram he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune through the whole evening and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her cards when the deal began must direct her in whatever was to be done with them to the end of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was in high spirits doing everything with happy ease and preeminent in all the lively turns quick resources and playful impudence that could do honour to the game and the round table was altogether a very comfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and orderly silence of the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice had sir thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his lady but in vain no pause was long enough for the time his measured manner needed and very little of her state could be known till mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grant was able at the end of the first rubber to go to her and pay her compliments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope your ladyship is pleased with the game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know what it is all about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am never to see my cards and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram said crawford some time afterwards taking the opportunity of a little languor in the game i have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had been hunting together and were in the midst of a good run and at some distance from mansfield when his horse being found to have flung a shoe henry crawford had been obliged to give up and make the best of his way back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you i lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yewtrees because i can never bear to ask but i have not told you that with my usual luckfor i never do wrong without gaining by iti found myself in due time in the very place which i had a curiosity to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was suddenly upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills a small stream before me to be forded a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place and not a gentleman or half a gentlemans house to be seen excepting oneto be presumed the parsonage within a stones throw of the said knoll and church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found myself in short in thornton lacey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it sounds like it said edmund but which way did you turn after passing sewells farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions though were i to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour you would never be able to prove that it was not thornton laceyfor such it certainly was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i told a man mending a hedge that it was thornton lacey and he agreed to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thornton lacey was the name of his impending living as miss crawford well knew and her interest in a negotiation for william prices knave increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well continued edmund and how did you like what you saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the farmyard must be moved i grant you but i am not aware of anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what charms do not a light heart spread over nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every bird that twittered in a bush every flower that enlivened the hedge seemed placed there to awaken me to raptureyes to rapture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the present moment was full fraught with happiness and on futurity i bestowed not a thought excepting to anticipate my success with the attorney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this man of the world with rosy face and simpering features received me politely nay kindly listened with complacency to my remonstrances though he scarcely heeded marys tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not then suspect that my eloquence was in my complexion the blush of seventeen or that in a world where humanity to women is the characteristic of advancing civilization the beauty of a young girl was so much more interesting than the distress of an old one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pressing my hand he promised to let peggy remain in the house as long as i wished.i more than returned the pressurei was so grateful and so happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emboldened by my innocent warmth he then kissed meand i did not draw backi took it for a kiss of charity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gay as a lark i went to dine at mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had previously obtained five shillings from my father towards reclothing the poor children of my care and prevailed on my mother to take one of the girls into the house whom i determined to teach to work and read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after dinner when the younger part of the circle retired to the music room i recounted with energy my tale that is i mentioned peggys distress without hinting at the steps i had taken to relieve her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss venables gave me halfacrown the heir five shillings but george sat unmoved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was cruelly distressed by the disappointmenti scarcely could remain on my chair and could i have got out of the room unperceived i should have flown home as if to run away from myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after several vain attempts to rise i leaned my head against the marble chimneypiece and gazing on the evergreens that filled the fireplace moralized on the vanity of human expectations regardless of the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was roused by a gentle tap on my shoulder from behind charlottes chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned my head and george slid a guinea into my hand putting his finger to his mouth to enjoin me silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a revolution took place not only in my train of thoughts but feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i trembled with emotionnow indeed i was in love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt in my pocket every five minutes only to feel the guinea and its magic touch invested my hero with more than mortal beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my fancy had found a basis to erect its model of perfection on and quickly went to work with all the happy credulity of youth to consider that heart as devoted to virtue which had only obeyed a virtuous impulse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bitter experience was yet to come that has taught me how very distinct are the principles of virtue from the casual feelings from which they germinate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have perhaps dwelt too long on a circumstance which is only of importance as it marks the progress of a deception that has been so fatal to my peace and introduces to your notice a poor girl whom intending to serve i led to ruin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still it is probable that i was not entirely the victim of mistake and that your father gradually fashioned by the world did not quickly become what i hesitate to call himout of respect to my daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to hasten to the more busy scenes of my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> venables and my mother died the same summer and wholly engrossed by my attention to her i thought of little else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the neglect of her darling my brother robert had a violent effect on her weakened mind for though boys may be reckoned the pillars of the house without doors girls are often the only comfort within <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they but too frequently waste their health and spirits attending a dying parent who leaves them in comparative poverty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after closing with filial piety a fathers eyes they are chased from the paternal roof to make room for the firstborn the son who is to carry the empty familyname down to posterity though occupied with his own pleasures he scarcely thought of discharging in the decline of his parents life the debt contracted in his childhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mothers conduct led me to make these reflections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great as was the fatigue i endured and the affection my unceasing solicitude evinced of which my mother seemed perfectly sensible still when my brother whom i could hardly persuade to remain a quarter of an hour in her chamber was with her alone a short time before her death she gave him a little hoard which she had been some years accumulating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dabney watched them put up their umbrella and move off strandward beneath it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued to look for a long time in an aimless ruminating way at the dismal prospect revealed by the window and the glass of the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the premature night was closing in miserably with increasing rain and a doleful whistle of rising wind round the corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last she shut up the unconsidered cashbook lighted another gasjet and striding to the door rapped sharply bring everything in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she called to the boy and helped later when he had completed his task and one of the two narrow outlets from the shop in front was satisfactorily blocked with the wares from without and all the floor about reeked with the grimy drippings of the oilskins i think you may go home now she said to him with the laconic abruptness to which he was so well accustomed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remembering the exhaustive enquiries which the mission people had made about him and his belongings as a preliminary to his getting this job he could not but be surprised at the mistresss question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in confusion he nodded assent got a mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he nodded and do you think yourself better than she is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the urchins dirty and unpleasant face screwed itself up in anxious perplexity over this strange query <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it cleared as he thought he grasped the idea and the rateyes he lifted to her gleamed with the fell acuteness of the dials <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shd be sorry if i wasnt he answered in swift rasping accents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a fair curse to an honest boy like me to ave go home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she bade him peremptorilyand frowned after him as he left to herself mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dabney did not reopen the cash bookthe wretched day indeed had been practically a blank in its historybut loitered about in the waning light among the shelves near the desk altering the position of books here and there and glancing cursorily through others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once or twice she went to the door and looked out upon the rainsoaked street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a tradesmans assistant opposite was rolling the iron shutters down for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if business in hats was over for the day how much more so in books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her shop had never been fitted with shuttersfor what reason she could not guess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the opened pages of numerous volumes were displayed close against the window but no one had ever broken a pane to get at them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apparently literature raised no desires in the criminal breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to close the shop there was nothing to do but lock and bolt the door and turn out the lights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last as the conviction of nightfall forced itself upon her from the drenched darkness outside she bent to put her hand to the key <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with a little start of surprise she stood erect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> someone was shutting it was her brother splashed and wet to the knees but with a glowing face who pushed his way in and confronted her with a broad grin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was such a masterful air about him that when he jovially threw an arm round her gaunt waist and gathered her up against his moist shoulder her vocabulary was not rich in phrases for this kind of emergency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive walked all the way from the city in the rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted the exertioni couldnt have sat in a cab <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come back and build up the fire and lets have a talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there isnt any fire down here she said apologetically as they edged their way through the restricted alley to the rear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old fireplace took up too much room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes in very sharp weather i have an oilstove in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont find it too colddo you?with your coat on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never mind the cold he replied throwing a leg over the stool before the desk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant stay more n a minute or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louisa had never in her life seen her brother look so well as he did now sprawling triumphantly upon the stool under the yellow gaslight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his strong heavilyfeatured face had somehow ceased to be commonplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had acquired an individual distinction of its own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked up at her with a clear bold eye in which the nervous and apprehensive lines had somehow vanished from the countenance and with them oddly enough that lethargic heavy expression which had been their complement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she deemed him almost handsome this curious changeable brother of hers as he beat with his fist in a measured way upon the desktop to emphasize his words and fastened his commanding gaze upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we took very nearly twenty thousand pounds today he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fortnight ago today was the first settlement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wasnt here but semple wasand the working of it is all in his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kept as still as a mouse that first day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had to deliver to us shares and they hadnt got one but we didnt make any fuss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the point was you see not to let them dream that they were caught in a trap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we didnt even put the price up to par <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had to come to semple and say there didnt seem to be any shares obtainable just at the moment and what would he carry them over at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that means to let them postpone delivery for another fortnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as smooth as sweetoil with them and agreed to carry them over till today without any charge at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the price was up ten shillings above par <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is to say semple arranged with a jobber on the quiet dye see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to offer thirty shillings for our onepound shares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so then when they were still without shares today and had to be carried over again they had to pay ten shillings difference on each of twentysix thousand shares plus the difference between par and the prices theyd sold at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that makes within a few hundreds of pounds in cash for one days haul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through previous talks she had really obtained an insight into the operation and it interested her more than she would have cared well then we put that pounds in our pockets he proceeded with a steady glow in his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fortnight hence that is march th we ring the bell on them again and they march up to the captains office and settle a second time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a jobber makes the price for semple again and that settles the new sum they have to pay us in differences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is for us to say what that price shall be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well decide on that when the time comes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we most probably will just put it up another ten shillings and so take in just a simple pounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its best in the long run i suppose to go slow with small rises like that in order not to frighten anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were full of that idea a while ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well frighten em stiff enough before were through with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the start we just go easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they got word that there was a corner there would be a dead scare among the jobbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd be afraid to sell or name a price for rubber consols unless they had the shares in hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there are other ways in which that would be a nuisance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently of course we shall liberate some few shares so that there may be some actual dealings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> probably a certain number of the which went to the general public will come into the market too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of course you see that all such shares will simply go through one operation before they come back to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some one of the fourteen men we are squeezing will snap them up and bring them straight to semple to get free from the fortnightly tax we are levying on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that way we shall eventually let out say half of these fourteen shorts or perhaps more than half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you want to do that for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sisters grey eyes had caught a metallic gleam as if from the talk about gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why cant you go on taking their money for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me the most natural thing when youd got em in the vise to keep them there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when you come to reflectyou cant get more out of a man than there is in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you press him too hard he can always go bankruptand then hes out of your reach altogether and you lose everything that you counted on making out of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so after a certain point each one of the fourteen men whom were squeezing must be dealt with on a different footing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall have to watch them all and study their resources as tipsters watch horses you see some of them can stand a loss of a hundred thousand pounds better than others could lose ten thousand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can take it as a principle that none of them will go bankrupt and lose his place on the exchange unless he is pressed tight to the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well our business is to learn how far each fellow is from the wall to start with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we keep track of him one turn of the screw after another till we see hes got just enough left to buy himself out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she commented calmly meditative everything in the city is cruel he assured her with a light tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i estimate in a rough way that these fourteen men will have to pay over to us in differences and in final sales say seven hundred thousand poundsmaybe eight hundred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well now not one of those fellows ever earned a single sovereign of that money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyve taken the whole of it from others and these others took it from others still and so on almost indefinitely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there isnt a sovereign of it that hasnt been through twenty hands or fifty for that matter since the last man who had done some honest work for it parted company with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellmoney like that belongs to those who are in possession of it only so long as they are strong enough to hold on to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when someone stronger still comes along he takes it away from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont complain they dont cry and say its cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they know its the rule of the game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they accept itand begin at once looking out for a new set of fools and weaklings to recoup themselves on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thorpe had concluded his philosophical remarks with ruminative slowness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he lapsed into silence now he fell to studying his own hands on the desktop before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stretched out the fingers curved them in different degrees then closed them tight and turned the bulky hardlooking thats the kind of hand he began again thoughtfully that breaks the jew in the long run if theres only grit enough behind it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to watch those jews hands a year ago when i was dining and wining them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre all thin and wiry and full of veins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their fingers are never still they twist round and keep stirring like a lobsters feelers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there aint any real strength in em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they get hold of most of the things that are going because theyre eternally on the move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its their hellish industry and activity that gives them such a pull and makes most people afraid of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when a hand like that takes them by the throathe held up his right hand as he spoke with the thick uncouth fingers and massive thumb arched menacingly in a powerful muscular tensionwhen that tightens round their neck and they feel that the grip means businessmy god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laughed contemptuously and slapped the relaxed palm on the desk with a noise which made his sister start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a man in here asking about you today she remarked in a casual fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is early morn and my mother has come noiselessly into my room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know it is she though my eyes are shut and i am only half awake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps i was dreaming of her for i accept her presence without surprise as if in the awakening i had but seen her go out at one door to come in at another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sweer to waken him i doubt he was working late oh that i start up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cry but i know before she answers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my sister is down with one of the headaches against which even she cannot fight and my mother who bears physical pain as if it were a comrade is most woebegone when her daughter is the sufferer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she winna let me go down the stair to make a cup of tea for her she groans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is what she has come to me for but it is a pity to rouse you she says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i will take charge of the house today and light the fires more like the fiftieth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she says almost gleefully so i have begun well for to keep up her spirits is the great thing today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i take in the bread looking so sternly at him that he dare not smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope he did not see that furious knocking in a remote part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this means that the author is in the coal cellar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anon i carry two breakfasts upstairs in triumph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i enter the bedroom like no mere humdrum son but after the manner of the glasgow waiter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been my mothers one waiter the only manservant she ever came in contact with and they had met in a glasgow hotel which she was eager to see having heard of the monstrous things and conceived them to resemble country inns with another twelve bedrooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember how she beamed yet tried to look as if it was quite an ordinary experience when we alighted at the hotel door but though she said nothing i soon read disappointment in her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew how i was exulting in having her there so would not say a word to damp me but i craftily drew it out of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she was very comfortable and the house was grand beyond speech but but where was he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i have sworn as my friend hastings here knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see then my good japp you go at once to styles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were seeing the coroner and the doctor first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> call for me in passingthe last house in the village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inglethorp will give you or if he refusesas is probablei will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the case against him could not possibly be sustained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and on behalf of the yard im much obliged to you though im bound to confess i cant at present see the faintest possible loophole in the evidence but you always were a marvel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two detectives strode away summerhaye with an incredulous grin on his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well my friend cried poirot before i could get in a word what do you think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had some warm moments in that court i did not figure to myself that the man would be so pigheaded as to refuse to say anything at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> decidedly it was the policy of an imbecile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are other explanations besides that of imbecility i remarked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if the case against him is true how could he defend himself except by silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why in a thousand ingenious ways cried poirot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see say that it is i who have committed this murder i can think of seven most plausible stories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear poirot i am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but seriously in spite of what i heard you say to the detectives you surely cannot still believe in the possibility of alfred inglethorps innocence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we turned in at the gate of leastways cottage and proceeded up the now familiar stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes yes too conclusive continued poirot almost to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here the whole thing is cut and dried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no my friend this evidence has been very cleverly manufacturedso cleverly that it has defeated its own ends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible it was very hard to disprove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in his anxiety the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set inglethorp free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us look at the matter like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is a man let us say who sets out to poison his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has lived by his wits as the saying goes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he goes boldly to the village chemists and purchases strychnine under his own name with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he does not employ the poison that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her of which the whole household is cognisant and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he prepares no defenceno shadow of an alibi yet he knows the chemists assistant must necessarily come forward with the facts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not ask me to believe that any man could be so idiotic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only a lunatic who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged would act so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you mon ami it puzzles me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you believe him innocent how do you explain his buying the strychnine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg your pardon he saw a man with a black beard like mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not recognize a man whom he had probably only seen in the distance since you remember he himself had only been in the village a fortnight and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you think mon ami do you remember the two points i laid stress upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leave the first one for the moment what was the second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the important fact that alfred inglethorp wears peculiar clothes has a black beard and uses glasses i quoted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as john or lawrence cavendish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course an actor but poirot cut me short ruthlessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell you my friend because they are both cleanshaven men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight it would need an actor of genius and a certain initial facial resemblance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the case of alfred inglethorp all that is changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his clothes his beard the glasses which hide his eyesthose are the salient points about his personal appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now what is the first instinct of the criminal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to divert suspicion from himself is it not so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this instance there was a man ready to his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected but to make it a sure thing there must be tangible proofsuch as the actual buying of the poison and that with a man of the peculiar appearance of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember this young mace had never actually spoken to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how should he doubt that the man in his clothes with his beard and his glasses was not alfred inglethorp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be so i said fascinated by poirots eloquence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if that was the case why does he not say where he was at six oclock on monday evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he were arrested he probably would speak but i do not want it to come to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must make him see the gravity of his position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is of course something discreditable behind his silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he did not murder his wife he is nevertheless a scoundrel and has something of his own to conceal quite apart from the murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mused won over to poirots views for the moment although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction was the correct one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes i had a little idea sometime agoand it has turned out to be correct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt think so hard about it said elizabeth marking the intensity with which lucetta was alternating the question whether this or that would suit best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but settling upon new clothes is so trying said lucetta <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are that person pointing to one of the arrangements or you are that totally different person pointing to the other for the whole of the coming spring and one of the two you dont know which may turn out to be very objectionable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was finally decided by miss templeman that she would be the cherrycoloured person at all hazards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dress was pronounced to be a fit and lucetta walked with it into the front room elizabeth following her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning was exceptionally bright for the time of year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun fell so flat on the houses and pavement opposite lucettas residence that they poured their brightness into her rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly after a rumbling of wheels there were added to this steady light a fantastic series of circling irradiations upon the ceiling and the companions turned to the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately opposite a vehicle of strange description had come to a standstill as if it had been placed there for exhibition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the newfashioned agricultural implement called a horsedrill till then unknown in its modern shape in this part of the country where the venerable seedlip was still used for sowing as in the days of the heptarchy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its arrival created about as much sensation in the cornmarket as a flying machine would create at charing cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the farmers crowded round it women drew near it children crept under and into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the machine was painted in bright hues of green yellow and red and it resembled as a whole a compound of hornet grasshopper and shrimp magnified enormously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or it might have been likened to an upright musical instrument with the front gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why it is a sort of agricultural piano she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has something to do with corn said elizabeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder who thought of introducing it here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> donald farfrae was in the minds of both as the innovator for though not a farmer he was closely leagued with farming operations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as if in response to their thought he came up at that moment looked at the machine walked round it and handled it as if he knew something about its make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two watchers had inwardly started at his coming and elizabeth left the window went to the back of the room and stood as if absorbed in the panelling of the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hardly knew that she had done this till lucetta animated by the conjunction of her new attire with the sight of farfrae spoke out let us go and look at the instrument whatever it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elizabethjanes bonnet and shawl were pitchforked on in a moment and they went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among all the agriculturists gathered round the only appropriate possessor of the new machine seemed to be lucetta because she alone rivalled it in colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they examined it curiously observing the rows of trumpet shaped tubes one within the other the little scoops like revolving saltspoons which tossed the seed into the upper ends of the tubes that conducted it to the ground till somebody said good morning elizabethjane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked up and there was her stepfather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his greeting had been somewhat dry and thunderous and elizabethjane embarrassed out of her equanimity stammered at random this is the lady i live with fathermiss templeman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henchard put his hand to his hat which he brought down with a great wave till it met his body at the knee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am happy to become acquainted with you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes henchard replied and he proceeded to explain it and still more forcibly to ridicule it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twas brought here by one of our machinists on the recommendation of a jumpedup jackanapes of a fellow who thinks his eye caught elizabethjanes imploring face and he stopped probably thinking that the suit might be progressing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then something seemed to occur which his stepdaughter fancied must really be a hallucination of hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a murmur apparently came from henchards lips in which she detected the words you refused to see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could not believe that they had been uttered by her stepfather unless indeed they might have been spoken to one of the yellow gaitered farmers near them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet lucetta seemed silent and then all thought of the incident was dissipated by the humming of a song which sounded as though from the interior of the machine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henchard had by this time vanished into the markethouse and both the women glanced towards the corn drill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could see behind it the bent back of a man who was pushing his head into the internal works to master their tws on a smr afternn a wee bere the sn wnt dn when kitty wi a braw nw gwn cme owre the hlls to gowrie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elizabethjane had apprehended the singer in a moment and looked guilty of she did not know what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucetta next recognized him and more mistress of herself said archly the lass of gowrie from inside of a seeddrillwhat a phenomenon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> satisfied at last with his investigation the young man stood upright and met their eyes across the summit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are looking at the wonderful new drill miss templeman said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but practically it is a stupid thingis it not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she added on the strength of henchards information <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no more sowers flinging their seed about broadcast so that some falls by the wayside and some among thorns and all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each grain will go straight to its intended place and nowhere else whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the romance of the sower is gone for good observed elizabethjane who felt herself at one with farfrae in biblereading at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he that observeth the wind shall not sow so the preacher said but his words will not be to the point any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> donald admitted his gaze fixing itself on a blank point far away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the machines are already very common in the east and north of england he added apologetically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucetta seemed to be outside this train of sentiment her acquaintance with the scriptures being somewhat limited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o no madam said he becoming embarrassed and deferential at the sound of her voice though with elizabeth jane he was quite at his ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no noi merely recommended that it should be got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the silence which followed farfrae appeared only conscious of her to have passed from perception of elizabeth into a brighter sphere of existence than she appertained to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucetta discerning that he was much mixed that day partly in his mercantile mood and partly in his well dont forsake the machine for us and went indoors with her companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter felt that she had been in the way though why was unaccountable to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucetta explained the matter somewhat i had occasion to speak to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farfrae the other day and so i knew him this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucetta was very kind towards elizabeth that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> together they saw the market thicken and in course of time thin away with the slow decline of the sun towards the upper end of town its rays taking the street endways and enfilading the long thoroughfare from top to bottom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gigs and vans disappeared one by one till there was not a vehicle in the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time of the riding world was over the pedestrian world held sway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> field labourers and their wives and children trooped in from the villages for their weekly shopping and instead of a rattle of wheels and a tramp of horses ruling the sound as earlier there was nothing but the shuffle of many feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the implements were gone all the farmers all the moneyed class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the character of the towns trading had changed from bulk to multiplicity and pence were handled now as pounds had been handled earlier in the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucetta and elizabeth looked out upon this for though it was night and the street lamps were lighted they had kept their shutters unclosed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the faint blink of the fire they spoke more freely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father was distant with you said lucetta <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and having forgotten the momentary mystery of henchards seeming speech to lucetta she continued it is because he does not think i am respectable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have tried to be so more than you can imagine but in vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mothers separation from my father was unfortunate for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know what it is to have shadows like that upon your life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do notof that kind precisely she said but you may feel asense of disgraceshamein other ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was thinking ofwhat happens sometimes when women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world from no fault of their own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it makes them anxious for might not other women despise them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her past was by no means secure from investigation even in casterbridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for one thing henchard had never returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in her first excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> possibly they were destroyed but she could have wished that they had never been written <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rencounter with farfrae and his bearings towards lucetta had made the reflective elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few days afterwards when her eyes met lucettas as the latter was going out she somehow knew that miss templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive scotchman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact was printed large all over lucettas cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as elizabethjane was beginning to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucetta passed on and closed the street door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a seers spirit took possession of elizabeth impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she followed lucetta thus mentallysaw her encounter donald somewhere as if by chancesaw him wear his special look when meeting women with an added intensity because this one was lucetta <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she depicted his impassioned manner beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed depicted their shaking of hands how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion thus invisible to all but themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this discerning silent witch had not done thinking of these things when lucetta came noiselessly behind her and made her start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all true as she had picturedshe could have sworn it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucetta had a heightened luminousness in her eye over and above the advanced colour of her cheeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knelt down on the hearth and took her friends hands excitedly in her own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after all she did not say when or how she had seen him or what he had said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as she slowly mounted the first flight of steps she suddenly came face to face with old grannis who was coming down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was between eight and nine and he was on his way to his little dog hospital no doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly miss baker was seized with trepidation her curious little false curls shook a fainta very faintflush came into her withered cheeks and her heart beat so violently under the worsted shawl that she felt obliged to shift the marketbasket to her other arm and put out her free hand to steady herself against the rail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his part old grannis was instantly overwhelmed with confusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his awkwardness seemed to paralyze his limbs his lips twitched and turned dry his hand went tremblingly to his chin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what added to miss bakers miserable embarrassment on this occasion was the fact that the old englishman should meet her thus carrying a sordid market basket full of sordid fish and cabbage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed as if a malicious fate persisted in bringing the two old people face to face at the most inopportune moments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little old dressmaker changed her basket to her other arm at precisely the wrong moment and old grannis hastening to pass removing his hat in a hurried salutation struck it with his fore arm knocking it from her grasp and sending it rolling and bumping down the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sole fell flat upon the first landing the lentils scattered themselves over the entire flight while the cabbage leaping from step to step thundered down the incline and brought up against the street door with a shock that reverberated through the entire building <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little retired dressmaker horribly vexed nervous and embarrassed was hard put to it to keep back the tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old grannis stood for a moment with averted eyes murmuring oh im so sorry im so sorry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marcus schouler coming down stairs from his room saved the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve upset your basketyou have for a fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and old grannis went up and down the flight gathering up the fish the lentils and the sadly battered cabbage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marcus was raging over the pusillanimity of alexander of which maria had just told him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill cut him in twowith the whip he shouted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will i will i say i will for a fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill give um all the fight he wants nasty mangy cur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to get the butchers bull pup and ill put um both in a bag and shake um up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will for a fact and i guess alec will fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come along mister grannis and he took the old englishman away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little miss baker hastened to her room and locked herself in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was excited and upset during all the rest of the day and listened eagerly for old granniss return that evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went instantly to work binding up the breeder and sportsman and back numbers of the nation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she heard him softly draw his chair and the table on which he had placed his little binding apparatus close to the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once she did the same brewing herself a cup of tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all through that evening the two old people kept company with each other after their own peculiar fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> setting out with each other miss baker had begun to call it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that they had been presented that they had even been forced to talk together had made no change in their relative positions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost immediately they had fallen back into their old ways again quite unable to master their timidity to overcome the stifling embarrassment that seized upon them when in each others presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a sort of hypnotism a thing stronger than themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they were not altogether dissatisfied with the way things had come to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was their little romance their last and they were living through it with supreme enjoyment and calm contentment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marcus schouler still occupied his old room on the floor above the mcteagues <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at long intervals the dentist or his wife met him on the stairs of the flat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes he would stop and talk with trina inquiring after the sieppes asking her if mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sieppe had yet heard of any one with whom he marcus could go in with on a ranch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had the quarrel between the two men been completely patched up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did not seem possible to the dentist now that marcus had ever been his pal that they had ever taken long walks together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sorry that he had treated marcus gratis for an ulcerated tooth while marcus daily recalled the fact that he had given up his girl to his friendthe girl who had won a fortuneas the great mistake of his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only once since the wedding had he called upon trina at a time when he knew mcteague would be out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trina had shown him through the rooms and had told him innocently enough how gay was their life there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marcus had come away fairly sick with envy his rancor against the dentistand against himself for that matterknew no bounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you might a had it all yourself marcus schouler he muttered to himself on the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile marcus was becoming involved in the politics of his ward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as secretary of the polk street improvement club which soon developed into quite an affair and began to assume the proportions of a republican political machinehe found he could make a little a very little more than enough to live on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once he had given up his position as old granniss assistant in the dog hospital <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marcus felt that he needed a wider sphere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had his eye upon a place connected with the city pound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the great railroad strike occurred he promptly got himself engaged as deputy sheriff and spent a memorable week in sacramento where he involved himself in more than one terrible melee with the strikers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marcus had that quickness of temper and passionate readiness to take offence which passes among his class for bravery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but whatever were his motives his promptness to face danger could not for a moment be doubted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the strike he returned to polk street and throwing himself into the improvement club heart soul and body soon became one of its ruling spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a certain local election where a huge paving contract was at stake the club made itself felt in the ward and marcus so managed his cards and pulled his wires that at the end of the matter he found himself some four hundred dollars to the good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when mcteague came out of his parlors at noon of the day upon which trina had heard the news of maria macapas intended marriage he found trina burning coffee on a shovel in the sittingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> try as she would trina could never quite eradicate from their rooms a certain faint and indefinable odor particularly offensive to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the smell of the photographers chemicals persisted in spite of all trina could do to combat it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she burnt pastilles and chinese punk and even as now coffee on a shovel all to no purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed the only drawback to their delightful home was the general unpleasant smell that pervaded ita smell that arose partly from the photographers chemicals partly from the cooking in the little kitchen and partly from the ether and creosote of the dentists parlors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as mcteague came in to lunch on this occasion he found the table already laid a red cloth figured with white flowers was spread and as he took his seat his wife put down the shovel on a chair and brought in the stewed codfish and the pot of chocolate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he tucked his napkin into his enormous collar mcteague looked vaguely about the room rolling his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the three years of their married life the mcteagues had made but few additions to their furniture trina declaring that they could not afford it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sitting room could boast of but three new ornaments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the melodeon hung their marriage certificate in a black frame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was balanced upon one side by trinas wedding bouquet under a glass case preserved by some fearful unknown process and upon the other by the photograph of trina and the dentist in their wedding finery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this latter picture was quite an affair and had been taken immediately after the wedding while mcteagues broadcloth was still new and before trinas silks and veil had lost their stiffness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it represented trina her veil thrown back sitting very straight in a rep armchair her elbows well in at her sides holding her bouquet of cut flowers directly before her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dentist stood at her side one hand on her shoulder the other thrust into the breast of his prince albert his chin in the air his eyes to one side his left foot forward in the attitude of a statue of a secretary of state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say trina said mcteague his mouth full of codfish heise looked in on me this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says whats the matter with a basket picnic over at schuetzen park next tuesday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know the paperhangers are going to be in the parlors all that day so ill have a holiday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heise says hell get the ryers to go too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ask selina to go she can meet us on the other side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trina still had her mania for family picnics which had been one of the sieppes most cherished customs but now there were other considerations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know as we can afford it this month mac she said pouring the chocolate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got to pay the gas bill next week and theres the papering of your office to be paid for some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i got a new patient this week had two molars and an upper incisor filled at the very first sitting and hes going to bring his children round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll cost three or four dollars at the very least and mind the heises pay their own fare both ways mac and everybody gets their own lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she added after a pause ill write and have selina join us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess ill have to put up a lunch for her though admitted trina the way we did last time because she lives in a boardinghouse now and they make a fuss about putting up a lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could count on pleasant weather at this time of the yearit was mayand that particular tuesday was all that could be desired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the party assembled at the ferry slip at nine oclock laden with baskets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mcteagues came last of all ryer and his wife had already boarded the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hello doctor cried the harnessmaker as the mcteagues came up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is what youd call an old folks picnic all married people this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the party foregathered on the upper deck as the boat started and sat down to listen to the band of italian musicians who were playing outside this morning because of the fineness of the weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh were going to have lots of fun cried trina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if its anything i do love its a picnic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure sure replied the dentist we had a gotha truffle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and august lost his steamboat put in trina and papa smacked him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heise nodding at a figure coming up the companionway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he caught sight of the party he gaped at them a moment in blank astonishment and then ran up his eyes wide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say aint ut queer we should all run up against each other like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made great sweeping bows to the three women and shook hands with cousin trina adding as he turned to the men of the party glad to see you mister heise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dentist who had formulated some sort of reserved greeting he ignored completely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mcteague settled himself in his seat growling inarticulately behind his mustache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a picnic exclaimed the three women all speaking at once and trina added were going over to the same old schuetzen park again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youre all fixed up yourself cousin mark you look as though you were going somewhere yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact marcus was dressed with great care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore a new pair of slateblue trousers a black cutaway and a white lawn tie for him the symbol of the height of elegance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he carried also his cane a thin wand of ebony with a gold head presented to him by the improvement club in recognition of services <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats right thats right said marcus with a grin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a bit of business to do over at oakland an i thought id go up to b street afterward and see selina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent called on but the party uttered an exclamation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sense of the importance of the task i had undertaken a consciousness that i was leaving london and stranger still going somewhere else a feeling of loneliness and a sensation of jolting quite bewildered my thoughts and for a time rendered me even insensible to the presence of my carpetbag and hatbox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall ever feel grateful to the driver of a blackwall omnibus who by thrusting the pole of his vehicle through the small door of the cabriolet awakened me from a tumult of imaginings that are wholly indescribable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of such materials is our imperfect nature composed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am happy to say that i am the first passenger on board and shall thus be enabled to give you an account of all that happens in the order of its occurrence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chimney is smoking a good deal and so are the crew and the captain i am informed is very drunk in a little house upon deck something like a black turnpike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should infer from all i hear that he has got the steam up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will readily guess with what feelings i have just made the discovery that my berth is in the same closet with those engaged by professor woodensconce mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor woodensconce has taken the shelf above me and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slug and professor grime the two shelves opposite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slugs bed is a long tin tube of about three inches in diameter carefully closed at both ends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some powerful instrument of a new construction ten minutes past nine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody has yet arrived nor has anything fresh come in my way except several joints of beef and mutton from which i conclude that a good plain dinner has been provided for tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a singular smell below which gave me some uneasiness at first but as the steward says it is always there and never goes away i am quite comfortable again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i learn from this man that the different sections will be distributed at the black boy and stomachache and the bootjack and countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if this intelligence be true and i have no reason to doubt it your readers will draw such conclusions as their different opinions may suggest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i write down these remarks as they occur to me or as the facts come to my knowledge in order that my first impressions may lose nothing of their original vividness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall despatch them in half past nine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some dark object has just appeared upon the wharf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think it is a quarter to ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four omnibuses full have just arrived upon the wharf and all is bustle and activity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cloths are laid in the cabins and the steward is placing blue plates full of knobs of cheese at equal distances down the centre of the tables <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he drew it back its hinges gave forth no sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barney looked toward the spot where he had seen the shadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he saw it scuttle hurriedly beneath another tree nearer the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> directly before the door where barney stood was a per gola ivycovered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind this he slid and running its length came out among the trees behind the night prowler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fellow was bearded and in his right hand he carried a package <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly barney recalled butzows comment upon the destruction of the mill if it was lightning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cold sweat broke from every pore of his body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother and father were there in the house and vicall sleeping peacefully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ran quickly toward the menacing figure and as he did so he saw the other halt behind a great tree and strike a match <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the glow of the flame he saw it touch close to the package that the fellow held and then he was upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stranger hurled the package toward the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barney caught him by the throat beating him heavily in the face and then realizing what the package was he hurled the fellow from him and sprang toward the hissing and sputtering missile where it lay close to the foundation wall of the house though in the instant of his close contact with the man he had recognized through the disguising beard the features of captain ernst maenck the principal tool of peter of blentz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quick though barney was to reach the bomb and ex tinguish the fuse maenck had disappeared before he re turned to search for him and though he roused the gardener and chauffeur and took turns with them in standing guard the balance of the night the wouldbe assassin did not return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no question in barney custers mind as to whom the bomb was intended for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that maenck had hurled it toward the house after barney had seized him was merely the result of accident and the mans desire to get the death dealing missile as far from himself as possible before it ex ploded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it would have wrecked the house in the hope of reaching him had he not fortunately interfered was too evident to the american to be questioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so he decided before the night was spent to put him self as far from his family as possible lest some future attempt upon his life might endanger theirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then too righteous anger and a desire for revenge prompted his de cision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would run maenck to earth and have an ac counting with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was evident that his life would not be worth a farthing so long as the fellow was at liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before dawn he swore the gardener and chauffeur to si lence and at breakfast announced his intention of leaving that day for new york to seek a commission as correspondent with an old classmate who owned the new york evening national <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the hotel barney inquired of the proprietor relative to a bearded stranger but the man had had no one of that description registered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his roadster was in a repair shop and as he stopped in to get it he overheard a conversation that told him all he wanted to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he stood talking with the foreman a dustcovered automobile pulled into the garage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hello bill called the foreman to the driver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> took a guy to lincoln replied the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bet we broke all the records for that stretch of road this morningi never knew the old boat had it in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> talked like a furriner and looked the part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he was a german army officer an had to beat it back on account of the war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seemed to me like he was mighty anxious to get back there an be killed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not even go home to say goodbye to his family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead he leaped into his gray roadstera later model of the one he had lost in luthaand the last that beatrice nebraska saw of him was a whirling cloud of dust as he raced north out of town toward lincoln <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was five minutes too late into the capital city to catch the eastbound limited that maenck must have taken but he caught the next through train for chicago and the second day thereafter found him in new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he had little difficulty in obtaining the desired credentials from his newspaper friend especially since barney offered to pay all his own expenses and donate to the paper anything he found time to write <end> <end> 
<start> <start> passenger steamers were still sailing though irregularly and after scanning the passengerlists of three he found the name he sought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he had not been mistaken after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was maenck he had appre hended on his fathers grounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently the man had little fear of being followed for he had made no effort to hide his identity in booking passage for europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the steamer he had caught had sailed that very morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barney was not so sorry after all for he had had time during his trip from beatrice to do considerable thinking and had found it rather difficult to determine just what to do should he have overtaken maenck in the united states <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he couldnt kill the man in cold blood justly as he may have deserved the fate and the thought of causing his ar rest and dragging his own name into the publicity of court proceedings was little less distasteful to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> furthermore the pursuit of maenck now gave barney a legitimate excuse for returning to lutha or at least to the close neighborhood of the little kingdom where he might await the outcome of events and be ready to give his services in the cause of the house of von der tann should they be required <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by going directly to italy and entering austria from that country barney managed to arrive within the boundaries of the dual monarchy with comparatively few delays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor did he encounter any considerable bodies of troops until he reached the little town of burgova which lies not far from the serbian frontier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond this point his credentials would not carry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no newspaper correspondents could be permitted nearer the front than burgova <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing to be done therefore but wait until some propitious event gave him the opportunity to approach more closely the serbian boundary and lutha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the mean time he would communicate with butzow who might be able to obtain passes for him to some village nearer the luthanian frontier when it should be an easy matter to cross through to serbia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sure the serbian authori ties would object less strenuously to his presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inn at which he applied for accommodations was al ready overrun by officers but the proprietor with scant apologies for a civilian offered him a little box of a room in the attic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place was scarce more than a closet and for that barney was in a way thankful since the limited space could accommodate but a single cot thus insuring him the privacy that a larger chamber would have precluded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very tired after his long and comfortless land journey so after an early dinner he went immediately to his room and to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long he slept he did not know but some time during the night he was awakened by the sound of voices apparently close to his ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he thought the speakers must be in his own room so distinctly did he overhear each word of their conversation but presently he discovered that they were upon the opposite side of a thin partition in an adjoining room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but half awake and with the sole idea of getting back to sleep again as quickly as possible barney paid only the slightest attention to the meaning of the words that fell upon his ears until like a bomb a sentence broke through his sleepy faculties banishing morpheus upon the instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will take but little now to turn leopold against von der tann <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already i have half convinced him that the old man aspires to the throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leopold fears the loyalty of his army which is for von der tann body and soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knows that von der tann is strongly antiaustrian and i have made it plain to him that if he allows his kingdom to take sides with serbia he will have no kingdom when the war is overit will be a part of austria <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with greater difficulty however my dear peter that i convinced him that you von coblich and captain maenck were his most loyal friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fears you yet but nevertheless he has pardoned you all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not forget when you return to your dear lutha that you owe your repatria tion to count zellerndorf of austria <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may be assured that we shall never forget replied another voice that barney recognized at once as belonging to prince peter of blentz the one time regent of lutha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not for myself continued count zellerndorf that i crave your gratitude but for my emperor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may do much to win his undying gratitude while for yourselves you may win to almost any height with the friendship of austria behind you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure that should any accident which god forfend deprive lutha of her king none would make a more welcome successor in the eyes of austria than our good friend peter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barney could almost see the smile of satisfaction upon the thin lips of peter of blentz as this broad hint fell from the lips of the austrian diplomata hint that seemed to the american little short of the death sentence of leopold king of lutha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we owed you much before count said peter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for you we should have been hanged a year agowithout your aid we should never have been able to escape from the fortress of lustadt or cross the border into austriahungary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry that maenck failed in his mission for had he not we would have had concrete evidence to present to the king that we are indeed his loyal supporters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have dispelled at once such fears and doubts as he may still entertain of our fealty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can assure you that the news we hoped captain maenck would bring from america would have gone a long way toward re storing you to the confidence and good graces of the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did my best came another voice that caused barneys eyes to go wide in astonishment for it was none other than the voice of maenck himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice i risked hanging to get him and only came away after i had been recognized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has sense enough and quickness enough he likes being on the land and its my belief that he could learn business well if he gave his mind to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his father and mother wanted him to be a fine gentleman and i think he has the same sort of feeling himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if the proposal came from you i am sure mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vincy would say that we wanted fred for mary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> life is a poor tale if it is to be settled by nonsense of that sort said caleb with disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but there is a certain pride which is proper caleb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i call it improper pride to let fools notions hinder you from doing a good action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres no sort of work said caleb with fervor putting out his hand and moving it up and down to mark his emphasis that could ever be done well if you minded what fools say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have it inside you that your plan is right and that plan you must follow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not oppose any plan you have set your mind on caleb said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> garth who was a firm woman but knew that there were some points on which her mild husband was yet firmer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still it seems to be fixed that fred is to go back to college will it not be better to wait and see what he will choose to do after that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not easy to keep people against their will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you are not yet quite sure enough of your own position or what you will want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it may be better to wait a bit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as to my getting plenty of work for two im pretty sure of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive always had my hands full with scattered things and theres always something fresh turning up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why only yesterdaybless me i dont think i told you!it was rather odd that two men should have been at me on different sides to do the same bit of valuing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said caleb taking a pinch of snuff and holding it up between his fingers as if it were a part of his exposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was fond of a pinch when it occurred to him but he usually forgot that this indulgence was at his command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife held down her knitting and looked attentive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why that rigg or rigg featherstone was one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but bulstrode was before him so im going to do it for bulstrode <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether its mortgage or purchase theyre going for i cant tell yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can that man be going to sell the land just left himwhich he has taken the name for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deuce knows said caleb who never referred the knowledge of discreditable doings to any higher power than the deuce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but bulstrode has long been wanting to get a handsome bit of land under his fingersthat i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and its a difficult matter to get in this part of the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caleb scattered his snuff carefully instead of taking it and then added the ins and outs of things are curious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is the land theyve been all along expecting for fred which it seems the old man never meant to leave him a foot of but left it to this sideslip of a son that he kept in the dark and thought of his sticking there and vexing everybody as well as he could have vexed em himself if he could have kept alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say it would be curious if it got into bulstrodes hands after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man hated him and never would bank with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what reason could the miserable creature have for hating a man whom he had nothing to do with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wheres the use of asking for such fellows reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the soul of man said caleb with the deep tone and grave shake of the head which always came when he used this phrasethe soul of man when it gets fairly rotten will bear you all sorts of poisonous toadstools and no eye can see whence came the seed thereof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was one of calebs quaintnesses that in his difficulty of finding speech for his thought he caught as it were snatches of diction which he associated with various points of view or states of mind and whenever he had a feeling of awe he was haunted by a sense of biblical phraseology though he could hardly have given a strict quotation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by swaggering could i never thrive for the rain it raineth every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the transactions referred to by caleb garth as having gone forward between mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joshua rigg featherstone concerning the land attached to stone court had occasioned the interchange of a letter or two between these personages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who shall tell what may be the effect of writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it happens to have been cut in stone though it lie face downmost for ages on a forsaken beach or rest quietly under the drums and tramplings of many conquests it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and other scandals gossiped about long empires ago this world being apparently a huge whisperinggallery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such conditions are often minutely represented in our petty lifetimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the stone which has been kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links of effect under the eyes of a scholar through whose labors it may at last fix the date of invasions and unlock religions so a bit of ink and paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stopgap may at last be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge enough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to uriel watching the progress of planetary history from the sun the one result would be just as much of a coincidence as the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having made this rather lofty comparison i am less uneasy in calling attention to the existence of low people by whose interference however little we may like it the course of the world is very much determined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be well certainly if we could help to reduce their number and something might perhaps be done by not lightly giving occasion to their existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> socially speaking joshua rigg would have been generally pronounced a superfluity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but those who like peter featherstone never had a copy of themselves demanded are the very last to wait for such a request either in prose or verse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the copy in this case bore more of outside resemblance to the mother in whose sex frogfeatures accompanied with freshcolored cheeks and a wellrounded figure are compatible with much charm for a certain order of admirers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result is sometimes a frogfaced male desirable surely to no order of intelligent beings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> especially when he is suddenly brought into evidence to frustrate other peoples expectations the very lowest aspect in which a social superfluity can present himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rigg featherstones low characteristics were all of the sober waterdrinking kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the earliest to the latest hour of the day he was always as sleek neat and cool as the frog he resembled and old peter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot almost more calculating and far more imperturbable than himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will add that his fingernails were scrupulously attended to and that he meant to marry a welleducated young lady as yet unspecified whose person was good and whose connections in a solid middleclass way were undeniable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus his nails and modesty were comparable to those of most gentlemen though his ambition had been educated only by the opportunities of a clerk and accountant in the smaller commercial houses of a seaport <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought the rural featherstones very simple absurd people and they in their turn regarded his bringing up in a seaport town as an exaggeration of the monstrosity that their brother peter and still more peters property should have had such belongings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the garden and gravel approach as seen from the two windows of the wainscoted parlor at stone court were never in better trim than now when mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rigg featherstone stood with his hands behind him looking out on these grounds as their master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it seemed doubtful whether he looked out for the sake of contemplation or of turning his back to a person who stood in the middle of the room with his legs considerably apart and his hands in his trouserpockets a person in all respects a contrast to the sleek and cool rigg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a man obviously on the way towards sixty very florid and hairy with much gray in his bushy whiskers and thick curly hair a stoutish body which showed to disadvantage the somewhat worn joinings of his clothes and the air of a swaggerer who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of fireworks regarding his own remarks on any other persons performance as likely to be more interesting than the performance itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his name was john raffles and he sometimes wrote jocosely wag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after his signature observing when he did so that he was once taught by leonard lamb of finsbury who wrote ba <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after his name and that he raffles originated the witticism of calling that celebrated principal balamb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such were the appearance and mental flavor of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raffles both of which seemed to have a stale odor of travellers rooms in the commercial hotels of that period <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come now josh he was saying in a full rumbling tone look at it in this light here is your poor mother going into the vale of years and you could afford something handsome now to make her comfortable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing would make her comfortable while you live returned rigg in his cool high voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you bear me a grudge josh that i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but come nowas between man and manwithout humbuga little capital might enable me to make a firstrate thing of the shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should cut my own nose off in not doing the best i could at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should stick to it like a flea to a fleece for my own sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and nothing would make your poor mother so happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive pretty well done with my wild oats turned fiftyfive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to settle down in my chimneycorner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i once buckled to the tobacco trade i could bring an amount of brains and experience to bear on it that would not be found elsewhere in a hurry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to be bothering you one time after another but to get things once for all into the right channel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> consider that joshas between man and manand with your poor mother to be made easy for her life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was always fond of the old woman by jove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rigg quietly without looking away from the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes ive done said raffles taking hold of his hat which stood before him on the table and giving it a sort of oratorical push <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more you say anything the less i shall believe it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more you want me to do a thing the more reason i shall have for never doing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think i mean to forget your kicking me when i was a lad and eating all the best victual away from me and my mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think i forget your always coming home to sell and pocket everything and going off again leaving us in the lurch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should be glad to see you whipped at the carttail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother was a fool to you shed no right to give me a fatherinlaw and shes been punished for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shall have her weekly allowance paid and no more and that shall be stopped if you dare to come on to these premises again or to come into this country after me again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next time you show yourself inside the gates here you shall be driven off with the dogs and the wagoners whip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as rigg pronounced the last words he turned round and looked at raffles with his prominent frozen eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the contrast was as striking as it could have been eighteen years before when rigg was a most unengaging kickable boy and raffles was the rather thickset adonis of barrooms and backparlors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the advantage now was on the side of rigg and auditors of this conversation might probably have expected that raffles would retire with the air of a defeated dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made a grimace which was habitual with him whenever he was out in a game then subsided into a laugh and drew a brandyflask from his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come josh he said in a cajoling tone give us a spoonful of brandy and a sovereign to pay the way back and ill go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mind said rigg drawing out a bunch of keys if i ever see you again i shant speak to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont own you any more than if i saw a crow and if you want to own me youll get nothing by it but a character for being what you area spiteful brassy bullying rogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a pity now josh said raffles affecting to scratch his head and wrinkle his brows upward as if he were nonplussed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im very fond of you by jove i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres nothing i like better than plaguing youyoure so like your mother and i must do without it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the brandy and the sovereigns a bargain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he jerked forward the flask and rigg went to a fine old oaken bureau with his keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but raffles had reminded himself by his movement with the flask that it had become dangerously loose from its leather covering and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within the fender he took it up and shoved it under the leather so as to make the glass firm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by that time rigg came forward with a brandybottle filled the flask and handed raffles a sovereign neither looking at him nor speaking to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after locking up the bureau again he walked to the window and gazed out as impassibly as he had done at the beginning of the interview while raffles took a small allowance from the flask screwed it up and deposited it in his sidepocket with provoking slowness making a grimace at his stepsons back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said raffles turning back his head as he opened the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rigg saw him leave the grounds and enter the lane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gray day had turned to a light drizzling rain which freshened the hedgerows and the grassy borders of the byroads and hastened the laborers who were loading the last shocks of corn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raffles walking with the uneasy gait of a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot looked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and industry as if he had been a baboon escaped from a menagerie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there were none to stare at him except the longweaned calves and none to show dislike of his appearance except the little waterrats which rustled away at his approach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was fortunate enough when he got on to the highroad to be overtaken by the stagecoach which carried him to brassing and there he took the newmade railway observing to his fellowpassengers that he considered it pretty well seasoned now it had done for huskisson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raffles on most occasions kept up the sense of having been educated at an academy and being able if he chose to pass well everywhere indeed there was not one of his fellowmen whom he did not feel himself in a position to ridicule and torment confident of the entertainment which he thus gave to all the rest of the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he played this part now with as much spirit as if his journey had been entirely successful resorting at frequent intervals to his flask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the paper with which he had wedged it was a letter signed nicholas bulstrode but raffles was not likely to disturb it from its present useful position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much methinks i could despise this man were i not bound in charity against it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the professional calls made by lydgate soon after his return from his weddingjourney was to lowick manor in consequence of a letter which had requested him to fix a time for his visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon had never put any question concerning the nature of his illness to lydgate nor had he even to dorothea betrayed any anxiety as to how far it might be likely to cut short his labors or his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this point as on all others he shrank from pity and if the suspicion of being pitied for anything in his lot surmised or known in spite of himself was embittering the idea of calling forth a show of compassion by frankly admitting an alarm or a sorrow was necessarily intolerable to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every proud mind knows something of this experience and perhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough to make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of exalting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon was now brooding over something through which the question of his health and life haunted his silence with a more harassing importunity even than through the autumnal unripeness of his authorship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true that this last might be called his central ambition but there are some kinds of authorship in which by far the largest result is the uneasy susceptibility accumulated in the consciousness of the author one knows of the river by a few streaks amid a longgathered deposit of uncomfortable mud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their most characteristic result was not the key to all mythologies but a morbid consciousness that others did not give him the place which he had not demonstrably meriteda perpetual suspicious conjecture that the views entertained of him were not to his advantage a melancholy absence of passion in his efforts at achievement and a passionate resistance to the confession that he had achieved nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus his intellectual ambition which seemed to others to have absorbed and dried him was really no security against wounds least of all against those which came from dorothea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he had begun now to frame possibilities for the future which were somehow more embittering to him than anything his mind had dwelt on before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> against certain facts he was helpless against will ladislaws existence his defiant stay in the neighborhood of lowick and his flippant state of mind with regard to the possessors of authentic wellstamped erudition against dorotheas nature always taking on some new shape of ardent activity and even in submission and silence covering fervid reasons which it was an irritation to think of against certain notions and likings which had taken possession of her mind in relation to subjects that he could not possibly discuss with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no denying that dorothea was as virtuous and lovely a young lady as he could have obtained for a wife but a young lady turned out to be something more troublesome than he had conceived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she nursed him she read to him she anticipated his wants and was solicitous about his feelings but there had entered into the husbands mind the certainty that she judged him and that her wifely devotedness was like a penitential expiation of unbelieving thoughtswas accompanied with a power of comparison by which himself and his doings were seen too luminously as a part of things in general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his discontent passed vaporlike through all her gentle loving manifestations and clung to that inappreciative world which she had only brought nearer to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this suffering was the harder to bear because it seemed like a betrayal the young creature who had worshipped him with perfect trust had quickly turned into the critical wife and early instances of criticism and resentment had made an impression which no tenderness and submission afterwards could remove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his suspicious interpretation dorotheas silence now was a suppressed rebellion a remark from her which he had not in any way anticipated was an assertion of conscious superiority her gentle answers had an irritating cautiousness in them and when she acquiesced it was a selfapproved effort of forbearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenacity with which he strove to hide this inward drama made it the more vivid for him as we hear with the more keenness what we wish others not to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of wondering at this result of misery in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot out the glory of the world and leave only a margin by which we see the blot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know no speck so troublesome as self <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon had chosen to expound his discontents his suspicions that he was not any longer adored without criticism could have denied that they were founded on good reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary there was a strong reason to be added which he had not himself taken explicitly into accountnamely that he was not unmixedly adorable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he suspected this however as he suspected other things without confessing it and like the rest of us felt how soothing it would have been to have a co pan ion who would never find it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this sore susceptibility in relation to dorothea was thoroughly prepared before will ladislaw had returned to lowick and what had occurred since then had brought mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubons power of suspicious construction into exasperated activity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to all the facts which he knew he added imaginary facts both present and future which become more real to him than those because they called up a stronger dislike a more predominating bitterness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suspicion and jealousy of will ladislaws intentions suspicion and jealousy of dorotheas impressions were constantly at their weaving work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be quite unjust to him to suppose that he could have entered into any coarse misinterpretation of dorothea his own habits of mind and conduct quite as much as the open elevation of her nature saved him from any such mistake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he was jealous of was her opinion the sway that might be given to her ardent mind in its judgments and the future possibilities to which these might lead her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to will though until his last defiant letter he had nothing definite which he would choose formally to allege against him he felt himself warranted in believing that he was capable of any design which could fascinate a rebellious temper and an undisciplined impulsiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was quite sure that dorothea was the cause of wills return from rome and his determination to settle in the neighborhood and he was penetrating enough to imagine that dorothea had innocently encouraged this course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as clear as possible that she was ready to be attached to will and to be pliant to his suggestions they had never had a teteatete without her bringing away from it some new troublesome impression and the last interview that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon was aware of dorothea on returning from freshitt hall had for the first time been silent about having seen will had led to a scene which roused an angrier feeling against them both than he had ever known before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorotheas outpouring of her notions about money in the darkness of the night had done nothing but bring a mixture of more odious foreboding into her husbands mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there was the shock lately given to his health always sadly present with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was certainly much revived he had recovered all his usual power of work the illness might have been mere fatigue and there might still be twenty years of achievement before him which would justify the thirty years of preparation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that prospect was made the sweeter by a flavor of vengeance against the hasty sneers of carp company for even when mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon was carrying his taper among the tombs of the past those modern figures came athwart the dim light and interrupted his diligent exploration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to convince carp of his mistake so that he would have to eat his own words with a good deal of indigestion would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship which the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all eternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since thus the prevision of his own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter savors of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness it is the less surprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other persons when he himself should have entered into glory had not a potently sweetening effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the truth should be that some undermining disease was at work within him there might be large opportunity for some people to be the happier when he was gone and if one of those people should be will ladislaw mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon objected so strongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his disembodied existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of putting the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the human soul moves in many channels and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon we know had a sense of rectitude and an honorable pride in satisfying the requirements of honor which compelled him to find other reasons for his conduct than those of jealousy and vindictiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon put the case was thisin marrying dorothea brooke i had to care for her wellbeing in case of my death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but wellbeing is not to be secured by ample independent possession of property on the contrary occasions might arise in which such possession might expose her to the more danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is ready prey to any man who knows how to play adroitly either on her affectionate ardor or her quixotic enthusiasm and a man stands by with that very intention in his minda man with no other principle than transient caprice and who has a personal animosity towards me i am sure of itan animosity which is fed by the consciousness of his ingratitude and which he has constantly vented in ridicule of which i am as well assured as if i had heard it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if i live i shall not be without uneasiness as to what he may attempt through indirect influence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this man has gained dorotheas ear he has fascinated her attention he has evidently tried to impress her mind with the notion that he has claims beyond anything i have done for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i dieand he is waiting here on the watch for that he will persuade her to marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be calamity for her and success for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would not think it calamity he would make her believe anything she has a tendency to immoderate attachment which she inwardly reproaches me for not responding to and already her mind is occupied with his fortunes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thinks of an easy conquest and of entering into my nest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a marriage would be fatal to dorothea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has he ever persisted in anything except from contradiction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in knowledge he has always tried to be showy at small cost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in religion he could be as long as it suited him the facile echo of dorotheas vagaries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i utterly distrust his morals and it is my duty to hinder to the utmost the fulfilment of his designs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon on his marriage left strong measures open to him but in ruminating on them his mind inevitably dwelt so much on the probabilities of his own life that the longing to get the nearest possible calculation had at last overcome his proud reticence and had determined him to ask lydgates opinion as to the nature of his illness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had mentioned to dorothea that lydgate was coming by appointment at halfpast three and in answer to her anxious question whether he had felt ill repliedno i merely wish to have his opinion concerning some habitual symptoms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall give orders that he may be sent to me in the yewtree walk where i shall be taking my usual exercise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when lydgate entered the yewtree walk he saw mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon slowly receding with his hands behind him according to his habit and his head bent forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a lovely afternoon the leaves from the lofty limes were falling silently across the sombre evergreens while the lights and shadows slept side by side there was no sound but the cawing of the rooks which to the accustomed ear is a lullaby or that last solemn lullaby a dirge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lydgate conscious of an energetic frame in its prime felt some compassion when the figure which he was likely soon to overtake turned round and in advancing towards him showed more markedly than ever the signs of premature agethe students bent shoulders the emaciated limbs and the melancholy lines of the mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor fellow he thought some men with his years are like lions one can tell nothing of their age except that they are full grown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon with his invariably po lite air i am exceedingly obliged to you for your punctuality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will if you please carry on our conversation in walking to and fro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope your wish to see me is not due to the return of unpleasant symptoms said lydgate filling up a pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in order to account for that wish i must mention what it were otherwise needless to refer tothat my life on all collateral accounts insignificant derives a possible importance from the incompleteness of labors which have extended through all its best years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short i have long had on hand a work which i would fain leave behind me in such a state at least that it might be committed to the press byothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were i assured that this is the utmost i can reasonably expect that assurance would be a useful circumscription of my attempts and a guide in both the positive and negative determination of my course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon paused removed one hand from his back and thrust it between the buttons of his singlebreasted coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to a mind largely instructed in the human destiny hardly anything could be more interesting than the inward conflict implied in his formal measured address delivered with the usual singsong and motion of the head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay are there many situations more sublimely tragic than the struggle of the soul with the demand to renounce a work which has been all the significance of its lifea significance which is to vanish as the waters which come and go where no man has need of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was nothing to strike others as sublime about mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon and lydgate who had some contempt at hand for futile scholarship felt a little amusement mingling with his pity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was at present too ill acquainted with disaster to enter into the pathos of a lot where everything is below the level of tragedy except the passionate egoism of the sufferer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you refer to the possible hindrances from want of health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubons purpose which seemed to be clogged by some hesitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not implied to me that the symptoms which i am bound to testifyyou watched with scrupulous care were those of a fatal disease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lydgate i should desire to know the truth without reservation and i appeal to you for an exact statement of your conclusions i request it as a friendly service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you can tell me that my life is not threatened by anything else than ordinary casualties i shall rejoice on grounds which i have already indicated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if not knowledge of the truth is even more important to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i can no longer hesitate as to my course said lydgate but the first thing i must impress on you is that my conclusions are doubly uncertainuncertain not only because of my fallibility but because diseases of the heart are eminently difficult to found predictions on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in any ease one can hardly increase appreciably the tremendous uncertainty of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe that you are suffering from what is called fatty degeneration of the heart a disease which was first divined and explored by laennec the man who gave us the stethoscope not so very many years ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a good deal of experiencea more lengthened observationis wanting on the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after what you have said it is my duty to tell you that death from this disease is often sudden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time no such result can be predicted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your condition may be consistent with a tolerably comfortable life for another fifteen years or even more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could add no information to this beyond anatomical or medical details which would leave expectation at precisely the same point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lydgates instinct was fine enough to tell him that plain speech quite free from ostentatious caution would be felt by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing more i have still to ask did you communicate what you have now told me to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lydgate was going to explain why he had told dorothea but mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon with an unmistakable desire to end the conversation waved his hand slightly and said again i thank you proceeding to remark on the rare beauty of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lydgate certain that his patient wished to be alone soon left him and the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward continued to pace the walk where the dark yewtrees gave him a mute companionship in melancholy and the little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted across the isles of sunlight stole along in silence as in the presence of a sorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was a man who now for the first time found himself looking into the eyes of death who was passing through one of those rare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a commonplace which is as different from what we call knowing it as the vision of waters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the water which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the commonplace we must all die transforms itself suddenly into the acute consciousness i must die and soon then death grapples us and his fingers are cruel afterwards he may come to fold us in his arms as our mother did and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be like the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubon now it was as if he suddenly found himself on the dark riverbrink and heard the plash of the oncoming oar not discerning the forms but expecting the summons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in such an hour the mind does not change its lifelong bias but carries it onward in imagination to the other side of death gazing backward perhaps with the divine calm of beneficence perhaps with the petty anxieties of selfassertion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubons bias his acts will give us a clew to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held himself to be with some private scholarly reservations a believing christian as to estimates of the present and hopes of the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what we strive to gratify though we may call it a distant hope is an immediate desire the future estate for which men drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> casaubons immediate desire was not for divine communion and light divested of earthly conditions his passionate longings poor man clung low and mistlike in very shady places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has told me in the strongest manner that he has never been his old self for one single minute since i first brought him to see you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss peecher our schoolmistresspretty and young and all thatis known to be very much attached to him and he wont so much as look at her or hear of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now his devotion to you must be a disinterested one mustnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he married miss peecher he would be a great deal better off in all worldly respects than in marrying you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then he has nothing to get very well then said the boy thats something in his favour and a great thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr headstone has always got me on and he has a good deal in his power and of course if he was my brotherinlaw he wouldnt get me on less but would get me on more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr headstone comes and confides in me in a very delicate way and says i hope my marrying your sister would be agreeable to you hexam and useful to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say theres nothing in the world mr headstone that i could he better pleased with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr headstone says then i may rely upon your intimate knowledge of me for your good word with your sister hexam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i say certainly mr headstone and naturally i have a good well said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you see we begin to get on the moment we begin to be really talking it over like brother and sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as mr headstones wife you would be occupying a most respectable station and you would be holding a far better place in society than you hold now and you would at length get quit of the riverside and the old disagreeables belonging to it and you would be rid for good of dolls dressmakers and their drunken fathers and the like of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that i want to disparage miss jenny wren i dare say she is all very well in her way but her way is not your way as mr headstones wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you see liz on all three accountson mr headstones on mine on yoursnothing could be better or they were walking slowly as the boy spoke and here he stood still to see what effect he had made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his sisters eyes were fixed upon him but as they showed no yielding and as she remained silent he walked her on again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was some discomfiture in his tone as he resumed though he tried to conceal it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having so much influence with you liz as i have perhaps i should have done better to have had a little chat with you in the first instance before mr headstone spoke for himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but really all this in his favour seemed so plain and undeniable and i knew you to have always been so reasonable and sensible that i didnt consider it worth while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very likely that was a mistake of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that need be done to set it right is for you to tell me at once that i may go home and tell mr headstone that what has taken place is not final and that it will all he stopped again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pale face looked anxiously and lovingly at him but she shook her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot authorize you to say any such thing to mr headstone i cannot allow you to say any such thing to mr headstone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing remains to be said to him from me after what i have said for good and this girl cried the boy contemptuously throwing her off charley dear that is the second time that you have almost struck me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that you intended it but you hardly know with what a sudden however <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the boy taking no heed of the remonstrance and pursuing his own mortified disappointment i know what this thats not true said the boy in a violent tone and you know its charley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you remember any old days of ours together but you shall not disgrace me doggedly pursued the boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am determined that after i have climbed up out of the mire you shall not pull me down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant disgrace me if i have nothing to do charley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on many a night like this and many a worse night i have sat on the stones of the street hushing you in my arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unsay those words without even saying you are sorry for them ill not unsay them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are an inveterately bad girl and a false sister and i have done with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for ever i he threw up his ungrateful and ungracious hand as if it set up a barrier between them and flung himself upon his heel and left her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she remained impassive on the same spot silent and motionless until the striking of the church clock roused her and she turned away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then with the breaking up of her immobility came the breaking up of the waters that the cold heart of the selfish boy had frozen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and o that i were lying here with the dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and o charley charley that this should be the end of our pictures in the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were all the words she said as she laid her face in her hands on the stone coping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a figure passed by and passed on but stopped and looked round at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the figure of an old man with a bowed head wearing a large brimmed lowcrowned hat and a longskirted coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after hesitating a little the figure turned back and pardon me young woman for speaking to you but you are under some distress of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot pass upon my way and leave you weeping here alone as if there was nothing in the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can i she raised her head at the sound of these kind words and my daughter said the old man i stand amazed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who my brother has quarrelled with me sobbed lizzie and he is a thankless dog said the jew angrily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shake the dust from thy feet and let him go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come home with meit is but across the roadand take a little time to recover your peace and to make your eyes seemly and then i will bear you company through the streets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it is past your usual time and will soon be late and the way is long and there is much she accepted the support he offered her and they slowly passed out of the churchyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were in the act of emerging into the main thoroughfare when another figure loitering discontentedly by and looking up the street and down it and all about started and exclaimed lizzie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why whats as eugene wrayburn thus addressed her she drew closer to the jew and bent her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jew having taken in the whole of eugene at one sharp glance cast his eyes upon the ground and stood mute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot tell you tonight if but lizzie i came expressly to join you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came to walk home with you having dined at a coffeehouse in this neighbourhood and knowing your hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i have been lingering about added the jew lifted up his eyes and took in eugene once more at another glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr wrayburn pray pray leave me with this protector <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i be excused for asking in the elderly gentlemans presence who a trustworthy friend said lizzie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will relieve him of his trust returned eugene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must tell her brother is the matter said the old man lifting up his eyes again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our brother is not worth a thought far less a tear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what has our the old man lifted up his eyes again with one grave look at wrayburn and one grave glance at lizzie as she stood looking down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both were so full of meaning that even eugene was checked in his light career and subsided into a thoughtful with an air of perfect patience the old man remaining mute and keeping his eyes cast down stood retaining lizzies arm as though in his habit of passive endurance it would be all one to him if he had stood there motionless all night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if mr aaron said eugene who soon found this fatiguing will be good enough to relinquish his charge to me he will be quite free for any engagement he may have at the synagogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr aaron but the old man stood stock still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good evening mr aaron said eugene politely we need not detain you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then turning to lizzie is our friend mr aaron a little my hearing is very good christian gentleman replied the old man calmly but i will hear only one voice tonight desiring me to leave this damsel before i have conveyed her to her home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if may i ask why so mr aaron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she asks me i will tell her replied the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i i do not ask you said lizzie and i beg you to take me home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr wrayburn i have had a bitter trial tonight and i hope you will not think me ungrateful or mysterious or changeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray my dear lizzie he returned in a low voice bending over her on he snapped his fingers and laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come said he since no better may be mr aaron and i will divide this trust and see you home together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr aaron on that side i on this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if perfectly he knew his power over her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that she would not insist upon his leaving her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that her fears for him being aroused she would be uneasy if he were out of her sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all his seeming levity and carelessness he knew whatever he chose to know of the thoughts of her heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and going on at her side so gaily regardless of all that had been urged against him so superior in his sallies and selfpossession to the gloomy constraint of her suitor and the selfish petulance of her brother so faithful to her as it seemed when her own stock was faithless what an immense advantage what an overpowering influence were his that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> add to the rest poor girl that she had heard him vilified for her sake and that she had suffered for his and where the wonder that his occasional tones of serious interest setting off his carelessness as if it were assumed to calm her that his lightest touch his lightest look his very presence beside her in the dark common street were like glimpses of an enchanted world which it was natural for jealousy and malice and all meanness to be unable to bear the brightness of and to gird at as bad spirits might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing more being said of repairing to riahs they went direct to lizzies lodging <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little short of the housedoor she parted from them and went in alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr aaron said eugene when they were left together in the street with many thanks for your company it remains for me sir returned the other i give you good night and i wish that you mr aaron returned eugene i give you good night and i wish but now that his part was played out for the evening and when in turning his back upon the jew he came off the stage he was thoughtful himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he murmured as he stopped to light his cigar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heavy sigh was repeated as if by an echo an hour afterwards when riah who had been sitting on some dark steps in a corner over against the house arose and went his patient way stealing through the streets in his ancient dress like the ghost of a departed time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the estimable twemlow dressing himself in his lodgings over the stableyard in duke street saint jamess and hearing the horses at their toilette below finds himself on the whole in a disadvantageous position as compared with the noble animals at livery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for whereas on the one hand he has no attendant to slap him soundingly and require him in gruff accents to come up and come over still on the other hand he has no attendant at all and the mild gentlemans fingerjoints and other joints working rustily in the morning he could deem it agreeable even to be tied up by the countenance at his chamberdoor so he were there skilfully rubbed down and slushed and sluiced and polished and clothed while himself taking merely a passive part in these trying transactions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how the fascinating tippins gets on when arraying herself for the bewilderment of the senses of men is known only to the graces and her maid but perhaps even that engaging creature though not reduced to the selfdependence of twemlow could dispense with a good deal of the trouble attendant on the daily restoration of her charms seeing that as to her face and neck this adorable divinity is as it were a diurnal species of lobsterthrowing off a shell every forenoon and needing to keep in a retired spot until the new crust hardens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howbeit twemlow doth at length invest himself with collar and cravat and wristbands to his knuckles and goeth forth to breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to breakfast with whom but his near neighbours the lammles of sackville street who have imparted to him that he will meet his distant kinsman mr fledgely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the awful snigsworth might taboo and prohibit fledgely but the peaceable twemlow reasons if he is my kinsman i didnt make him so and it is the first anniversary of the happy marriage of mr and mrs lammle and the celebration is a breakfast because a dinner on the desired scale of sumptuosity cannot be achieved within less limits than those of the nonexistent palatial residence of which so many people are madly envious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so twemlow trips with not a little stiffness across piccadilly sensible of having once been more upright in figure and less in danger of being knocked down by swift vehicles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be sure that was in the days when he hoped for leave from the dread snigsworth to do something or be something in life and before that magnificent tartar issued the ukase as he will never distinguish himself he must be a poor gentlemanpensioner of mine and let him hereby consider himself ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say little feeble grey personage what thoughts are in thy breast today of the fancyso still to call her who bruised thy heart when it was green and thy head brownand whether it be better or worse more painful or less to believe in the fancy to this hour than to know her for a greedy armour plated crocodile with no more capacity of imagining the delicate and sensitive and tender spot behind thy waistcoat than of going straight at it with a knittingneedle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say likewise my twemlow whether it be the happier lot to be a poor relation of the great or to stand in the wintry slush giving the hack horses to drink out of the shallow tub at the coachstand into which thou has so nearly set thy uncertain foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he approaches the lammles door drives up a little onehorse carriage containing tippins the divine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tippins letting down the window playfully extols the vigilance of her cavalier in being in waiting there to hand her out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twemlow hands her out with as much polite gravity as if she were anything real and they proceed upstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tippins all abroad about the legs and seeking to express that those unsteady articles are only skipping in their native buoyancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dear mrs lammle and dear mr lammle how do you do and when are you going down to whatsitsname placeguy earl of warwick you knowwhat is it?dun cowto claim the flitch of bacon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mortimer whose name is for ever blotted out from my list of lovers by reason first of fickleness and then of base desertion how do you do wretch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what can you come for because we are all very sure beforehand that you are not going to talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how are things going on down at the house and when will you turn out those terrible people for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mrs veneering my dear can it positively be true that you go down to that stifling place night after night to hear those men prose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> talking of which veneering why dont you prose for you havent opened your lips there yet and we are dying to hear what you have got to say to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus tippins and surveys fledgeby and outsiders through golden glass murmuring as she turns about and about in her innocent giddy way anybody else i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr lammle all aglitter produces his friend fledgeby as dying for the honour of presentation to lady tippins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fledgeby presented has the air of going to say something has the air of going to say nothing has an air successively of meditation of resignation and of desolation backs on brewer makes the tour of boots and fades into the extreme background feeling for his whisker as if it might have turned up since he was there five minutes ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lammle has him out again before he has so much as completely ascertained the bareness of the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would seem to be in a bad way fledgeby for lammle represents him as dying again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is dying now of want of presentation to twemlow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your mother sir i believe so says fledgeby but my mother and her family were are you staying in town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but is felled flat by fledgebys taking it quite ill and replying no he dont like town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lammle tries to break the force of the fall by remarking that some people do not like town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fledgeby retorting that he never heard of any such case but his own twemlow goes down again heavily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing new this morning i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says twemlow returning to the mark with great spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no theres not a word of news says lammle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow the execution of this little concerted piece appears to raise the general spirits as with a sense of duty done and sets the company a going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody seems more equal than before to the calamity of being in the society of everybody else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even eugene standing in a window moodily swinging the tassel of a blind gives it a smarter jerk now as if he found himself in better case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything on table showy and gaudy but with a selfassertingly temporary and nomadic air on the decorations as boasting that they will be much more showy and gaudy in the palatial residence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr lammles own particular servant behind his chair the analytical behind veneerings chair instances in point that such servants fall into two classes one mistrusting the masters acquaintances and the other mistrusting the master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> appearing to be lost in wonder and low spirits because the police are so long in coming to take his master up on some charge of the first magnitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the right of mrs lammle twemlow on her left mrs veneering wmp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wife of member of parliament and lady tippins on mr lammles right and left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but be sure that well within the fascination of mr lammles eye and smile sits little georgiana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and be sure that close to little georgiana also under inspection by the same gingerous gentleman sits fledgeby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oftener than twice or thrice while breakfast is in progress mr twemlow gives a little sudden turn towards mrs lammle and then says to her i beg your pardon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this not being twemlows usual way why is it his way today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the truth is twemlow repeatedly labours under the impression that mrs lammle is going to speak to him and turning finds that it is not so and mostly that she has her eyes upon veneering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strange that this impression so abides by twemlow after being corrected yet so it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lady tippins partaking plentifully of the fruits of the earth including grapejuice in the category becomes livelier and applies herself to elicit sparks from mortimer lightwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is always understood among the initiated that that faithless lover must be planted at table opposite to lady tippins who will then strike conversational fire out of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a pause of mastication and deglutition lady tippins contemplating mortimer recalls that it was at our dear veneerings and in the presence of a party who are surely all here that he told them his story of the man from somewhere which afterwards became so horribly interesting and vulgarly popular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes lady tippins assents mortimer as they say on the stage even so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we expect you retorts the charmer to sustain your lady tippins i exhausted myself for life that day and there is mortimer parries thus with a sense upon him that elsewhere it is eugene and not he who is the jester and that in these circles where eugene persists in being speechless he mortimer is but the double of the friend on whom he has founded himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but quoth the fascinating tippins i am resolved on getting something more out of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is this i hear about as it is you who have heard it returns lightwood perhaps youll monster away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your own golden mr lammle striking in here proclaims aloud that there is a sequel to the story of the man from somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you says lightwood glancing round the table i have nothing to tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but eugene adding in a low voice there tell it tell it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he corrects himself with the addition nothing worth boots and brewer immediately perceive that it is immensely worth mentioning and become politely clamorous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> veneering is also visited by a perception to the same effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is understood that his attention is now rather used up and difficult to hold that being the tone of the house of commons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray dont be at the trouble of composing yourselves to listen says mortimer lightwood because i shall have finished long ill tell you a story of jack a manory and now my storys begun ill tell you another of jack and his brother and now my story is done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eugene says this with a sound of vexation in his voice leaning back in his chair and looking balefully at lady tippins who nods to him as her dear bear and playfully insinuates that she a self evident proposition is beauty and he beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reference proceeds mortimer which i suppose to be made by my honourable and fair enslaver opposite is to the following circumstance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very lately the young woman lizzie hexam daughter of the late jesse hexam otherwise gaffer who will be remembered to have found the body of the man from somewhere mysteriously received she knew not from whom an explicit retraction of the charges made against her father by another waterside character of the name of riderhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody believed them because little rogue riderhoodi am tempted into the paraphrase by remembering the charming wolf who would have rendered society a great service if he had devoured mr riderhoods father and mother in their infancyhad previously played fast and loose with the said charges and in fact abandoned them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however the retraction i have mentioned found its way into lizzie hexams hands with a general flavour on it of having been favoured by some anonymous messenger in a dark cloak and slouched hat and was by her forwarded in her fathers vindication to mr boffin my client <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will excuse the phraseology of the shop but as i never had another client and in all likelihood never shall have i am rather proud of him as a although as easy as usual on the surface lightwood is not quite as easy as usual below it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with an air of not minding eugene at all he feels that the subject is not altogether a safe one in that connexion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the natural curiosity which forms the sole ornament of my professional museum he resumes hereupon desires his secretaryan individual of the hermitcrab or oyster species and whose name i think is chokesmithbut it doesnt in the least mattersay artichoketo put himself in communication with lizzie hexam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> artichoke professes his readiness so to do why fails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pardon me returns lightwood i must postpone the reply for one moment or we shall have an anticlimax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> artichoke failing signally my client refers the task to me his purpose being to advance the interests of the object of his search <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i proceed to put myself in communication with her i even happen to possess some special means with a glance at eugene of putting myself in vanished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody knows how nobody knows when nobody knows where <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so ends the story to tippins with a bewitching little scream opines that we shall every one of us be murdered in our beds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eugene eyes her as if some of us would be enough for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remarks that these social mysteries make one afraid of leaving baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wishes to be informed with something of a secondhand air of seeing the right honourable gentleman at the head of the home department in his place whether it is intended to be conveyed that the vanished person has been spirited away or otherwise harmed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of lightwoods answering eugene answers and answers hastily and vexedly no no no he doesnt mean that he means voluntarily vanishedbut utterly however the great subject of the happiness of mr and mrs lammle must not be allowed to vanish with the other vanishmentswith the vanishing of the murderer the vanishing of julius handford the vanishing of lizzie hexamand therefore veneering must recall the present sheep to the pen from which they have strayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who so fit to discourse of the happiness of mr and mrs lammle they being the dearest and oldest friends he has in the world or what audience so fit for him to take into his confidence as that audience a noun of multitude or signifying many who are all the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so veneering without the formality of rising launches into a familiar oration gradually toning into the parliamentary singsong in which he sees at that board his dear friend twemlow who on that day twelvemonth bestowed on his dear friend lammle the fair hand of his dear friend sophronia and in which he also sees at that board his dear friends boots and brewer whose rallying round him at a period when his dear friend lady tippins likewise rallied round himay and in the foremost rank he can never forget while memory holds her seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he is free to confess that he misses from that board his dear old friend podsnap though he is well represented by his dear young friend georgiana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he further sees at that board this he announces with pomp as if exulting in the powers of an extraordinary telescope his friend mr fledgeby if he will permit him to call him so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all of these reasons and many more which he right well knows will have occurred to persons of your exceptional acuteness he is here to submit to you that the time has arrived when with our hearts in our glasses with tears in our eyes with blessings on our lips and in a general way with a profusion of gammon and spinach in our emotional larders we should one and all drink to our dear friends the lammles wishing them many years as happy as the last and many many friends as congenially united as themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this he will add that anastatia veneering who is instantly heard to weep is formed on the same model as her old and chosen friend sophronia lammle in respect that she is devoted to the man who wooed and won her and nobly discharges the duties of a wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing no better way out of it veneering here pulls up his oratorical pegasus extremely short and plumps down clean over then lammle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too much of him every way pervadingly too much nose of a coarse wrong shape and his nose in his mind and his manners too much smile to be real too much frown to be false too many large teeth to be visible at once without suggesting a bite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thanks you dear friends for your kindly greeting and hopes to receive youit may be on the next of these delightfiil occasionsin a residence better suited to your claims on the rites of hospitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will never forget that at veneerings he first saw sophronia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sophronia will never forget that at veneerings she first saw him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they spoke of it soon after they were married and agreed that they would never forget it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact to veneering they owe their union <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hope to show their sense of this some day no no from veneeringoh yes yes and let him rely upon it they will if they can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his marriage with sophronia was not a marriage of interest on either side she had her little fortune he had his little fortune they joined their little fortunes it was a marriage of pure inclination and suitability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sophronia and he are fond of the society of young people but he is not sure that their house would be a good house for young people proposing to remain single since the contemplation of its domestic bliss might induce them to change their minds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will not apply this to any one present certainly not to their darling little georgiana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither bytheby will he apply it to his friend fledgeby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thanks veneering for the feeling manner in which he referred to their common friend fledgeby for he holds that gentleman in the highest estimation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact returning unexpectedly to fledgeby the better you know him the more you find in him that you desire to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his dear sophronias name and in his own thank you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs lammle has sat quite still with her eyes cast down upon the tablecloth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as mr lammles address ends twemlow once more turns to her involuntarily not cured yet of that often recurring impression that she is going to speak to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time she really is going to speak to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> veneering is talking with his other next neighbour and she speaks in a low voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still a little doubtful because of her not looking at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have the soul of a gentleman and i know i may trust you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you give me the opportunity of saying a few words to you dont seem to do so if you please and dont think it inconsistent if my manner should be more careless than my words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may be intensely astonished twemlow puts his hand to his forehead and sinks back in his chair meditating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fledgeby has devoted the interval to taking an observation of bootss whiskers brewers whiskers and lammles whiskers and considering which pattern of whisker he would prefer to produce out of himself by friction if the genie of the cheek would only answer to his rubbing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lightwood boots and brewer flutter like moths around that yellow wax candle guttering down and with some hint of a windingsheet in itlady tippins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lammle stands with folded arms mephistophelean in a corner with georgiana and fledgeby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs lammle on a sofa by a table invites mr twemlows attention to a book of portraits in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr twemlow takes his station on a settee before her and mrs lammle shows him a portrait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have reason to be surprised she says softly but i wish you disturbed twemlow making an effort not to look so looks much more so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think mr twemlow you never saw that distant connexion of now that you do see him you see what he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not proud if you knew more of him you would be less inclined to acknowledge him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think of twemlow has just presence of mind enough to say aloud very you have noticed perhaps whom he favours with his attentions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had brought their work nearly to an end and had already begun to line it with ferndown the gathering of which demanded more distant journeys and longer absences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the syringa immemorial manor of the catbirds was not more than twenty feet away and these giddy neighbors had as it appeared been all along jealously watchful though silent witnesses of what they deemed an intrusion of squatters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i exclaimedmiss burroughs i meanwhat is the meaning of this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont ask me for any meanings now she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you and your uncle to take me to the collingwoods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you are on your way there for they wrote you were coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us be quick for im afraid jane will come down and she will be sure to wake up aunty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw one of you go out to the barn and knew you intended to leave so i got ready just as fast as i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i must leave some word for aunty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just let me add a line to it said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am as well as i ever was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave her a pencil and she hurriedly wrote something on the paper which i had left on the kitchen table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then quickly glancing around she picked up a large carvingfork and sticking it through the paper into the soft wood of the table she left it standing there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it wont blow away when we open the door she whispered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cannot go out to the barn i said we will bring up the sleigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no no no she answered i must not wait here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i once get out of the house i shall feel safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i shall go anyway but i dont want any quarrelling on this christmas morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im with you there said uncle beamish approvingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doctor we can take her to the barn without her touching the snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let her sit in this armchair and we can carry her between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in half a minute the kitchen door was softly closed behind us and we were carrying miss burroughs to the barn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dozens of questions were on my tongue but i had no chance to ask any of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> uncle beamish and i returned to the porch for the valises and then closing the back door we rapidly began to make preparations for leaving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose said uncle beamish as we went into the stable leaving miss burroughs in the wagonhouse that this business is all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you seem to know the young woman and she is of age to act for herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever she wants to do i answered is perfectly right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not understand the matter any more than you do but i know she is expected at the collingwoods and wants to go there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well git away fust and ask explanations afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glover said miss burroughs as we led the horse into the wagonhouse dont put the bells on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stuff them gently under the seatas softly as you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how are we all to go away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been looking at that sleigh and it is intended only for two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its rather late to think of that miss said uncle beamish but theres one thing thats certain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were both very polite to ladies but neither of us is willin to be left behind on this trip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its a goodsized sleigh and well all pack in well enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and me can sit on the seat and the doctor can stand up in front of us and drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in old times it was considered the right thing for the driver of the sleigh to stand up and do his drivin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baggage was carefully stowed away and after a look around the dimly lighted wagonhouse miss burroughs and uncle beamish got into the sleigh and i tucked the big fur robe around them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hate to make a journey before breakfast said uncle beamish as i was doing this especially on christmas mornin but somehow or other there seems to be somethin jolly about this business and we wont have to wait so long for breakfast nuther <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it cant be far from my sisters and well all stop there and have breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you two can leave me and go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shell be as glad to see any friends of mine as if they were her own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and shell be pretty sure on a mornin like this to have buckwheat cakes and sausages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss burroughs looked at the old man with a puzzled air but she asked him no questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how are you going to keep yourself warm dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh this long ulster will be enough for me i replied and as i shall stand up i could not use a robe if we had another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact the thought of being with miss burroughs and the anticipation of a sleighride alone with her after we had left uncle beamish with his sister had put me into such a glow that i scarcely knew it was cold weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd better be keerful doctor said uncle beamish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont want to git rheumatism in your jints on this christmas mornin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres this horseblanket that we are settin on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont need it and youd better wrap it round you after you git in to keep your legs warm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may look funny but we will not meet anybody so early as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i and now we are ready to start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i slid back the barn door and then led the horse outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> closing the door and making as little noise as possible in doing it i got into the sleigh finding plenty of room to stand up in front of my companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i wrapped the horseblanket about the lower part of my body and as i had no belt with which to secure it miss burroughs kindly offered to fasten it round my waist by means of a long pin which she took from her hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is impossible to describe the exhilaration that pervaded me as she performed this kindly office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after thanking her warmly i took the reins and we started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is so lucky whispered miss burroughs that i happened to think about the bells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slowly uplifted hoofs of the horse descended quietly into the soft snow and the sleighrunners slipped along without a sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drive straight for the gate doctor whispered uncle beamish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it dont matter nothin about goin over flowerbeds and grassplats in such weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed his advice for no roadway could be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we had gone but a short distance when the horse suddenly stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i clicked gently and tapped the horse with the whip but he did not move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a dreadful thing whispered miss burroughs leaning forward for him to stop so near the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as she spoke she half rose behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come ahn and well have a hell of a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother in the corner upreared her head and shook her tangled locks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> teh hell wid him and you she said glowering at her daughter in the gloom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yehve gone teh deh devil mag johnson yehs knows yehs have gone teh deh devil <end> <end>

<start> <start> oh what deh hell mag see whispered he softly in her ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deh ol woman ill be all right in deh mornin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl cast a glance about the room filled with a chaotic mass of debris and at the red writhing body of her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jimmie had an idea it wasnt common courtesy for a friend to come to ones home and ruin ones sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was not sure how much pete knew about the rules of politeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following night he returned home from work at rather a late hour in the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in passing through the halls he came upon the gnarled and leathery old woman who possessed the music box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was grinning in the dim light that drifted through dust stained panes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she beckoned to him with a smudged forefinger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah jimmie what do yehs tink i got onto las night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was deh funnies ting i ever saw she cried coming close to him and leering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was trembling with eagerness to tell her tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yer lookin fagged an yer eyes is gettin more like yer fathers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im glad things is takin a good turn with yoh an yohll never be like him starvin fur th kind wured an havin to die without it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holmes shook the grimy hand and then stood a moment looking back to the mill from which the hands were just coming and then down at the phaeton moving idly down the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people passing by had a sickly look as if they were struck by the plague <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pushed the damp hair back wiping his forehead with another glance at the millwomen coming out of the gate and then followed the phaeton down the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an hour after the evening came on sultry the air murky opaque with yellow trails of colour dragging in the west a sullen stillness in the woods and farms only in fact that dark inexplicable hush that precedes a storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lois coming down the hillroad singing to herself and keeping time with her whipend on the wooden measure stopped when she grew conscious of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to her blurred fancy more than a deadening sky a something solemn and unknown hinting of evil to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dwarfpines on the roadside scowled weakly at her through the gray the very silver minnows in the pools she passed flashed frightened away and darkened into the muddy niches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a vague dread in the sudden silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she called to the old donkey and went faster down the hill as if escaping from some overhanging peril unseen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a phaeton behind lois and some horsemen she jolted the cart off into the stones to let them pass seeing mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holmess face in the carriage as she did so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not look at her had his head turned towards the gray distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loiss vivid eye caught the full meaning of the woman beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the face hurt her not fair as polston called it vapid and cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was dressed in yellow the colour seemed jeering and mocking to the girls sensitive instinct keenly alive to every trifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not know that it is the colour of shams and that women like this are the most deadly of shams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the phaeton went slowly down margret came nearer meeting it on the roadside the dust from the wheels stifling the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lois saw her look up and then suddenly stand still holding to the fence as they met her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holmess cold wandering eye turned on the little dusty figure standing there poor and despised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polston called his eyes hungry it was a savage hunger that sprang into them now a gray shadow creeping over his set face as he looked at her in that flashing moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the phaeton was gone in an instant leaving her alone in the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the men looked back and then whispered something to the lady with a laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned to holmes when he had finished fixing her light confusing eyes on his face and softening her voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred swears that woman we passed was your first love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it to have been a second romaunt of king cophetua and the beggar maid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he met her look and saw the fierce demand through the softness and persiflage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave it no answer but turning to her kindled into the man whom she was so proud to show as her capturea man far off from stephen holmes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought she knew him well held him a slave to her fluttering hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being proud of her slave she let the hand flutter down now somehow with some flowers it held until it touched his hard fingers her cheek flushing into rose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nerveless spongy handwhat a deathgrip it had on his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not look back once at the motionless dusty figure on the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was that polston had said about starving to death for a kind word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sick of the sickly talkcrushed it out of his heart with a savage scorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remembered his father the night he died had said in his weak ravings that god was love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder then he was the god of women and children and unsuccessful men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was here with stronger purpose than to yield to weaknesses of the flesh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had made his choicea straight hard path upwards he was deaf now and forever to any word of kindness or pity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for this woman beside him he would be just to her in justice to himself she never should know the loathing in his heart just to her as to all living creatures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some little mean doubt kept up a sullen whisper of bought and soldsoldbut he laughed it down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat there with his head steadily turned towards her a kingly face she called it and she was rightit was a kingly face with the same shallow fixed smile on his mouthno weary cry went up to god that day so terrible in its pathos i think with the same dull consciousness that this was the trial night of his lifethat with the homely figure on the roadside he had turned his back on love and kindly happiness and warmth on all that was weak and useless in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had made his choice he would abide by ithe would abide by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that over and over again dulling down the deathgnawing of his outraged heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss herne was quite contented sitting by him with herself and the admiring world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had no notion of trial nights in life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not many temptations pierced through her callous flabby temperament to sting her to defeat or triumph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was for her no undercurrent of conflict in these people whom she passed between self and the unseen power that holmes sneered at whose name was love they were nothing but movables pleasant or ugly to look at well or illdressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no dark iron bars across her life for her soul to clutch and shake madlynothing in the world amiss to be unriddled by and by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little margret sitting by the muddy road digging her fingers dully into the cloverroots while she looked at the spot where the wheels had passed looked at life differently it may beor old joe yare by the furnacefire his black face and gray hair bent over a torn old spellingbook lois had given him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night perhaps was going to be more to them than so many rainy hours for sleepingthe time to be looked back on through coming lives as the hour when good and ill came to them and they made their choice and as holmes said did abide by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holmes left the phaeton before they entered town and turned back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was going to see this margret howth tell her what he meant to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because he was going to leave a clean record <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one should accuse him of want of honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john received this communication with much composure and said in a few words that it would have afforded him inexpressible pleasure to do the kingston people so slight a service if it were not for his unfortunate propensity to fall asleep which no man regretted more than himself upon the present occasion but which quite settled the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless he said there was a gentleman present and here he looked very hard at a tall farrier who having been engaged all his life in the manufacture of horseshoes must be quite invulnerable to the power of witches and who he had no doubt from his own reputation for bravery and goodnature would readily accept the commission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the farrier politely thanked him for his good opinion which it would always be his study to deserve but added that with regard to the present little matter he couldnt think of it on any account as his departing on such an errand would certainly occasion the instant death of his wife to whom as they all knew he was tenderly attached <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now so far from this circumstance being notorious everybody had suspected the reverse as the farrier was in the habit of beating his lady rather more than tender husbands usually do all the married men present however applauded his resolution with great vehemence and one and all declared that they would stop at home and die if needful which happily it was not in defence of their lawful partners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this burst of enthusiasm over they began to look as by one consent toward will marks who with his cap more on one side than ever sat watching the proceedings with extraordinary unconcern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had never been heard openly to express his disbelief in witches but had often cut such jokes at their expense as left it to be inferred publicly stating on several occasions that he considered a broomstick an inconvenient charger and one especially unsuited to the dignity of the female character and indulging in other free remarks of the same tendency to the great amusement of his wild companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they looked at will they began to whisper and murmur among themselves and at length one man cried why dont you ask will as this was what everybody had been thinking of they all took up he dont care said the farrier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not he added another voice in the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dont believe in it you know sneered a little man with a yellow face and a taunting nose and chin which he thrust out from under the arm of a long man before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides said a redfaced gentleman with a gruff voice hes a thats the point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the farrier and all the married men murmured ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was it and they only wished they were single themselves they would show him what spirit was very soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be a wet night friend and my gray nag is tired after here there was a general titter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but resumed will looking about him with a smile if nobody else puts in a better claim to go for the credit of the town i am your man and i would be if i had to go afoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in five minutes i shall be in the saddle unless i am depriving any worthy gentleman here of the honour of the adventure which i wouldnt do for the but here arose a double difficulty for not only did john podgers combat the resolution with all the words he had which were not many but the young lady combated it too with all the tears she had which were very many indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will however being inflexible parried his uncles objections with a joke and coaxed the young lady into a smile in three short whispers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was plain that he set his mind upon it and would go john podgers offered him a few firstrate charms out of his own pocket which he dutifully declined to accept and the young lady gave him a kiss which he also returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see what a rare thing it is to be married said will and how careful and considerate all these husbands are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres not a man among them but his heart is leaping to forestall me in this adventure and yet a strong sense of duty keeps him back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not jav nor any other softskinned lotharian she replied but a real man a real warriorcarthoris of helium <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what could your red warrior accomplish against my fearless legions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he caught her roughly to him dragging her towards his couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will not be my queen he said you shall be my slave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she spoke the single word there was a quick move of her right hand tario releasing her staggered back both hands pressed to his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same instant the room filled with bowmen and then the jeddak of lothar sank senseless to the marble floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the instant that he lost consciousness the bowmen were about to release their arrows into thuvias heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> involuntarily she gave a single cry for help though she knew that not even carthoris of helium could save her now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she closed her eyes and waited for the end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she raised her lids to see what stayed the hand of her executioners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room was empty save for herself and the still form of the jeddak of lothar lying at her feet a little pool of crimson staining the white marble of the floor beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an instant before the room had been mysteriously filled with armed men evidently called to protect their jeddak yet now with the evidence of her deed plain before them they had vanished as mysteriously as they had come leaving her alone with the body of their ruler into whose side she had slipped her long keen blade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl glanced apprehensively about first for signs of the return of the bowmen and then for some means of escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wall behind the dais was pierced by two small doorways hidden by heavy hangings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thuvia was running quickly towards one of these when she heard the clank of a warriors metal at the end of the apartment behind her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah if she had but an instant more of time she could have reached that screening arras and perchance have found some avenue of escape behind it but now it was too lateshe had been discovered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a feeling that was akin to apathy she turned to meet her fate and there before her running swiftly across the broad chamber to her side was carthoris his naked longsword gleaming in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for days she had doubted his intentions of the heliumite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had thought him a party to her abduction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since fate had thrown them together she had scarce favoured him with more than the most perfunctory replies to his remarks unless at such times as the weird and uncanny happenings at lothar had surprised her out of her reserve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew that carthoris of helium would fight for her but whether to save her for himself or another she was in doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that she was promised to kulan tith jeddak of kaol but if he had been instrumental in her abduction his motives could not be prompted by loyalty to his friend or regard for her honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet as she saw him coming across the marble floor of the audience chamber of tario of lothar his fine eyes filled with apprehension for her safety his splendid figure personifying all that is finest in the fighting men of martial mars she could not believe that any faintest trace of perfidy lurked beneath so glorious an exterior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never she thought in all her life had the sight of any man been so welcome to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with difficulty that she refrained from rushing forward to meet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew that he loved her but in time she recalled that she was promised to kulan tith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not even might she trust herself to show too great gratitude to the heliumite lest he misunderstand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his quick glance had taken in the scene within the roomthe still figure of the jeddak sprawled upon the floorthe girl hastening toward a shrouded exit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she held up her crimsoned blade that he might see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she said he did not harm me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now let us see if we may not make good our escape from this accursed city before the lotharians discover that their jeddak is no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the firm authority that sat so well upon him in whose veins flowed the blood of john carter of virginia and dejah thoris of helium he grasped her hand and turning back across the hall strode toward the great doorway through which jav had brought them into the presence of the jeddak earlier in the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this house had not been built in the ordinary sense it had grown through centuries grown out of desire and necessity just as a tree grows and was therefore fit and beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was no wonder that about every room floated the perfume of ancient things and the peculiar family aura that had saturated all the inanimate objects around them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few days life settled itself to orderly occupations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the squire was a late riser the judge and his family breakfasted very early <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the two women had a ride in the park or wandered in the garden or sat reading or sewing or writing in some of the sweet fair rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many visitors soon appeared and there were calls to return and courtesies to accept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among these visitors the tyrrel rawdons were the earliest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the representatives of that family were nicholas rawdon and his wife lydia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholas rawdon was a large stout man very arrogant very complete very alert for this world and not caring much about the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not pleased at judge rawdons visit but thought it best to be cousinly until his cousin interfered with his plansrights he called themand then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and his then implied a great deal for nicholas rawdon was a man incapable of conceiving the idea of loving an enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife was a pleasant garrulous woman who interested ethel very much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her family was her chief topic of conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had two daughters one of whom had married a baronet a man with money and easy to manage and the other a rich cotton lord in manchester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they havent done badly she said confidentially and its a great thing to get girls off your hands early <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adelaide and martha were well educated and suitable but she added with a glow of pride you should see my john thomas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes manager of the mill and he loves the mill and he knows every pound of warp or weft that comes in or goes out of the mill and what his father would do without him im sure i dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he is a member of parliament tooradical ticket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was a thing to do wasnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my john thomas doesnt blame him for itthe gentry have to be conservatives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john thomas said little against his politics he just set the crowd laughing at his wayshis dandified ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he tried to wear one eyeglass and let it fall and fall and then told the men he couldnt manage half a pair of spectacles but he could manage their interests and fight for their rights and such like talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he walked like mostyn and he talked like mostyn and spread out his legs and twirled his walking stick like mostyn and asked them if they would wish him to go to parliament in that kind of a shape as hed try and do it if they wanted a tailormade man and they laughed him down and then he spoke reasonable to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john thomas knows what yorkshire weavers want and he just prom ised them everything they had set their hearts on and so they sent him to parliament and mostyn went to america where perhaps theyll teach him that a mans life is worth a bit more than a bird or a rabbit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mostyn is all for preserving game and his father was a mean creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when one thinks of his father one has to excuse the young man a little bit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he used to speak highly of his father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill warrant he did and he ought to keep at it for hes the only one in this world that will use his tongue for that end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old samuel mostyn never learned to live godly or even manly but after his death he ceased to do evil and that ive no doubt often feels like a blessing to them that had to live anyway near to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh cried ethel laughing you must not tell me so much about john thomas he might not like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john thomas can look all he does and all he says straight in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may talk of him all day and find nothing to say that a good girl like you might not listen to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have brought him with us but hes away now taking a bit of a holiday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why he went with a cousin to show him the sights of london but somehow they got through london sights very quick and thought they might as well put paris in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont trust foreigners and foreign ways and they dont have the same kind of money as ours but nicholas says i neednt worry he is sure that our john thomas if change is to make will make it to suit himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might say today or any other early day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes been idling for a month now and his father says the very looms are calling out for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill bring him to see you just as soon as he comes home looms or no looms and hell be fain to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one appreciates a pretty girl more than john thomas does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the days passed sweetly and swiftly onward and there was no trouble in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such business as was to be done went on behind the closed doors of the squires office and with no one present but himself judge rawdon and the attorneys attached to the rawdon and mostyn estates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as there were no entanglements and no possible reason for disputing a settlement was quickly arrived at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as mostyns return was uncertain an attorneys messenger properly accredited was sent to america to procure his signatures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allowing for unforeseen delays the perfected papers of release might certainly be on hand by the fifteenth of july and it was proposed on the first of august to give a dinner and dance in return for the numerous courtesies the american rawdons had received <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as this date approached ruth and ethel began to think of a visit to london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wanted new gowns and many other pretty things and why not go to london for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the journey was but a few hours and two or three days shopping in regent street and piccadilly would be delightful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will make out a list of all we need this afternoon said ruth and we might as well go tomorrow morning as later and at this moment a servant entered with the mail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is from dora she said and her voice had a tone of annoyance in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think she will interfere much ruth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dears said judge rawdon i have a letter from fred mostyn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will be in london in a day or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the things he says well it would be a very risky thing for our young folks to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me that a play that doesnt leave a nice taste in the mouth and that hasnt any message is nothing butnothing but well whatever it may be it isnt art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so now ive found a play that is clean and theres some awfully funny scenes in it too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its called his mothers heart and its about a young man in college who gets in with a lot of free thinkers and boozers and everything but in the end his mothers influence juanita haydock broke in with a derisive oh rats raymie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say lets give something with some class to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bet we could get the rights to the girl from kankakee and thats a real show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it ran for eleven months in new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be lots of fun if it wouldnt cost too much reflected vida <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carols was the only vote cast against the girl from kankakee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she disliked the girl from kankakee even more than she had expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it narrated the success of a farmlassie in clearing her brother of a charge of forgery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she became secretary to a new york millionaire and social counselor to his wife and after a wellconceived speech on the discomfort of having money she married his son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol discerned that both juanita haydock and ella stowbody wanted the lead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> juanita kissed her and in the exuberant manner of a new star presented to the executive committee her theory what we want in a play is humor and pep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres where american playwrights put it all over these darn old european glooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as selected by carol and confirmed by the committee the john grimm a millionaire guy pollock his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grimm miss ella stowbody the girl from kankakee mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david dyer stenographer miss rita simons officeboy miss myrtle cass maid in the grimms home mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kennicott among the minor lamentations was maud dyers well of course i suppose i look old enough to be juanitas mother even if juanita is eight months older than i am but i dont know as i care to have everybody noticing it and carol pleaded oh my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i chose you because you have such a darling complexion and you know with powder and a white wig anybody looks twice her age and i want the mother to be sweet no matter who else is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ella stowbody the professional perceiving that it was because of a conspiracy of jealousy that she had been given a small part alternated between lofty amusement and christian patience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol hinted that the play would be improved by cutting but as every actor except vida and guy and herself wailed at the loss of a single line she was defeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told herself that after all a great deal could be done with direction and settings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sam clark had boastfully written about the dramatic association to his schoolmate percy bresnahan president of the velvet motor company of boston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bresnahan sent a check for a hundred dollars sam added twentyfive and brought the fund to carol fondly crying there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thatll give you a start for putting the thing across swell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rented the second floor of the city hall for two months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all through the spring the association thrilled to its own talent in that dismal room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they cleared out the bunting ballot boxes handbills legless chairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was raised above the floor and it did have a movable curtain painted with the advertisement of a druggist dead these ten years but otherwise it might not have been recognized as a stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were two dressingrooms one for men one for women on either side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dressingroom doors were also the stageentrances opening from the house and many a citizen of gopher prairie had for his first glimpse of romance the bare shoulders of the leading woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were three sets of scenery a woodland a poor interior and a rich interior the last also useful for railway stations offices and as a background for the swedish quartette from chicago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were three gradations of lighting full on half on and entirely off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the only theater in gopher prairie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once strolling companies had used it for performances of the two orphans and nellie the beautiful cloak model and othello with specialties between acts but now the motionpictures had ousted the gipsy drama <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol intended to be furiously modern in constructing the officeset the drawingroom for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time that any one in gopher prairie had been so revolutionary as to use enclosed scenes with continuous sidewalls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rooms in the opra house sets had separate wingpieces for sides which simplified dramaturgy as the villain could always get out of the heros way by walking out through the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inhabitants of the humble home were supposed to be amiable and intelligent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol planned for them a simple set with warm color <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could see the beginning of the play all dark save the high settles and the solid wooden table between them which were to be illuminated by a ray from offstage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the high light was a polished copper pot filled with primroses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> less clearly she sketched the grimm drawingroom as a series of cool high white arches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to how she was to produce these effects she had no notion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she discovered that despite the enthusiastic young writers the drama was not half so native and close to the soil as motor cars and telephones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she discovered that simple arts require sophisticated training <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she discovered that to produce one perfect stagepicture would be as difficult as to turn all of gopher prairie into a georgian garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she read all she could find regarding staging she bought paint and light wood she borrowed furniture and drapes unscrupulously she made kennicott turn carpenter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> against the protest of kennicott and vida she mortgaged the association by sending to minneapolis for a baby spotlight a strip light a dimming device and blue and amber bulbs and with the gloating rapture of a born painter first turned loose among colors she spent absorbed evenings in grouping dimmingpainting with lights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they speculated as to how flats could be lashed together to form a wall they hung crocusyellow curtains at the windows they blacked the sheetiron stove they put on aprons and swept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the association dropped into the theater every evening and were literary and superior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had borrowed carols manuals of playproduction and had become extremely stagey in vocabulary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> juanita haydock rita simons and raymie wutherspoon sat on a sawhorse watching carol try to get the right position for a picture on the wall in the first scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to hand myself anything but i believe ill give a swell performance in this first act confided juanita <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to wear oh a dandy dress i have all scarletand i said to her when i enter wouldnt it knock their eyes out if i just stood there at the door in this straight scarlet thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young rita agreed shes so much taken up with her old details and carpentering and everything that she cant see the picture as a whole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i thought it would be lovely if we had an officescene like the one in little but oh my <end> <end> 
<start> <start> juanita sighed i wanted to give one speech like ethel barrymore would if she was in a play like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry and i heard her one time in minneapoliswe had dandy seats in the orchestrai just know i could imitate her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol didnt pay any attention to my suggestion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to criticize but i guess ethel knows more about acting than carol does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say do you think carol has the right dope about using a strip light behind the fireplace in the second act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told her i thought we ought to use a bunch offered raymie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i suggested it would be lovely if we used a cyclorama outside the window in the first act and what do you think she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes and it would be lovely to have eleanora duse play the lead she said and aside from the fact that its evening in the first act youre a great technician she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must say i think she was pretty sarcastic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been reading up and i know i could build a cyclorama if she didnt want to run everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes and another thing i think the entrance in the first act ought to be l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and why does she just use plain white tormenters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol did not resent their criticisms she didnt very much resent their sudden knowledge so long as they let her make pictures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was at rehearsals that the quarrrels broke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one understood that rehearsals were as real engagements as bridgegames or sociables at the episcopal church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gaily came in half an hour late or they vociferously came in ten minutes early and they were so hurt that they whispered about resigning when carol protested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they telephoned i dont think id better come out afraid the dampness might start my toothache or guess cant make it tonight dave wants me to sit in on a poker game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when after a month of labor as many as nineelevenths of the cast were often present at a rehearsal when most of them had learned their parts and some of them spoke like human beings carol had a new shock in the realization that guy pollock and herself were very bad actors and that raymie wutherspoon was a surprisingly good one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all her visions she could not control her voice and she was bored by the fiftieth repetition of her few lines as maid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guy pulled his soft mustache looked selfconscious and turned mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but raymie as the villain had no repressions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tilt of his head was full of character his drawl was admirably vicious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an evening when carol hoped she was going to make a play a rehearsal during which guy stopped looking abashed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know our parts well enough now whats the use of getting sick of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they began to skylark to play with the sacred lights to giggle when carol was trying to make the sentimental myrtle cass into a humorous officeboy to act everything but the girl from kankakee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> terry gould had great applause for his burlesque of hamlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even raymie lost his simple faith and tried to show that he could do a vaudeville shuffle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see here i want this nonsense to stop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve simply got to get down to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> juanita haydock led the mutiny look here carol dont be so bossy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all were doing this play principally for the fun of it and if we have fun out of a lot of monkey shines why then yees feebly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said one time that folks in g <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now we are having a circus you want us to stop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol answered slowly i wonder if i can explain what i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the difference between looking at the comic page and looking at manet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want fun out of this of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only i dont think it would be less fun but more to produce as perfect a play as we can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was curiously exalted her voice was strained she stared not at the company but at the grotesques scrawled on the backs of wingpieces by forgotten stagehands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder if you can understand the fun of making a beautiful thing the pride and satisfaction of it and the holiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in gopher prairie it is not good form to be holy except at a church between tenthirty and twelve on sunday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if we want to do it weve got to work we must have selfdiscipline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did not want to affront this mad woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol did not hear juanita in front protesting to maud dyer if she calls it fun and holiness to sweat over her darned old playwell i dont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol attended the only professional play which came to gopher prairie that spring <end> <end>

<start> <start> the only trouble with the girl from kankakee is that its too subtle for gopher prairie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sought faith in spacious banal phrases taken from books the instinctive nobility of simple souls need only the opportunity to appreciate fine things and sturdy exponents of democracy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but these optimisms did not sound so loud as the laughter of the audience at the funnymans line yes by heckelum im a smart fella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wanted to give up the play the dramatic association the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she came out of the tent and walked with kennicott down the dusty spring street she peered at this straggling wooden village and felt that she could not possibly stay here through all of tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was miles bjornstam who gave her strengthhe and the fact that every seat for the girl from kankakee had been sold <end> <end>

<start> <start> it was the great night it was the night of the play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two dressingrooms were swirling with actors panting twitchy pale <end> <end>

<start> <start> the actors were beseeching hey del put some red in my nostrilsyou put some in ritasgee you didnt hardly do anything to my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they examined dels makeup box they sniffed the scent of greasepaint every minute they ran out to peep through the hole in the curtain they came back to inspect their wigs and costumes they read on the whitewashed walls of the dressingrooms the pencil inscriptions the flora flanders comedy company and this is a bum theater and felt that they were companions of these vanished troupers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol smart in maids uniform coaxed the temporary stage hands to finish setting the first act wailed at kennicott the electrician now for heavens sake remember the change in cue for the ambers in act two slipped out to ask dave dyer the tickettaker if he could get some more chairs warned the frightened myrtle cass to be sure to upset the wastebasket when john grimm called here you reddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> del snafflins orchestra of piano violin and cornet began to tune up and every one behind the magic line of the proscenic arch was frightened into paralysis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carol wavered to the hole in the curtain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were so many people out there in the second row she saw miles bjornstam not with bea but alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps this evening would convert gopher prairie to conscious beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she darted into the womens dressingroom roused maud dyer from her fainting panic pushed her to the wings and ordered the curtain up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it rose doubtfully it staggered and trembled but it did get up without catchingthis time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she realized that kennicott had forgotten to turn off the houselights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she galloped round to the left wing herself pulled the switch looked so ferociously at kennicott that he quaked and fled back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the indian smiled grimly and extended one hand in sign of a willingness to exchange while with the other he flourished the babe over his head holding it by the feet as if to enhance the value of the ransom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the breathless woman tearing the lighter articles of dress from her person with illdirected and trembling fingers take all but give me my babe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the savage spurned the worthless rags and perceiving that the shawl had already become a prize to another his bantering but sullen smile changing to a gleam of ferocity he dashed the head of the infant against a rock and cast its quivering remains to her very feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an instant the mother stood like a statue of despair looking wildly down at the unseemly object which had so lately nestled in her bosom and smiled in her face and then she raised her eyes and countenance toward heaven as if calling on god to curse the perpetrator of the foul deed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was spared the sin of such a prayer for maddened at his disappointment and excited at the sight of blood the huron mercifully drove his tomahawk into her own brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother sank under the blow and fell grasping at her child in death with the same engrossing love that had caused her to cherish it when living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that dangerous moment magua placed his hands to his mouth and raised the fatal and appalling whoop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scattered indians started at the wellknown cry as coursers bound at the signal to quit the goal and directly there arose such a yell along the plain and through the arches of the wood as seldom burst from human lips before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they who heard it listened with a curdling horror at the heart little inferior to that dread which may be expected to attend the blasts of the final summons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more than two thousand raving savages broke from the forest at the signal and threw themselves across the fatal plain with instinctive alacrity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall not dwell on the revolting horrors that succeeded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> death was everywhere and in his most terrific and disgusting aspects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> resistance only served to inflame the murderers who inflicted their furious blows long after their victims were beyond the power of their resentment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the flow of blood might be likened to the outbreaking of a torrent and as the natives became heated and maddened by the sight many among them even kneeled to the earth and drank freely exultingly hellishly of the crimson tide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trained bodies of the troops threw themselves quickly into solid masses endeavoring to awe their assailants by the imposing appearance of a military front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the experiment in some measure succeeded though far too many suffered their unloaded muskets to be torn from their hands in the vain hope of appeasing the savages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in such a scene none had leisure to note the fleeting moments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might have been ten minutes it seemed an age that the sisters had stood riveted to one spot horror stricken and nearly helpless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the first blow was struck their screaming companions had pressed upon them in a body rendering flight impossible and now that fear or death had scattered most if not all from around them they saw no avenue open but such as conducted to the tomahawks of their foes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on every side arose shrieks groans exhortations and curses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this moment alice caught a glimpse of the vast form of her father moving rapidly across the plain in the direction of the french army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was in truth proceeding to montcalm fearless of every danger to claim the tardy escort for which he had before conditioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fifty glittering axes and barbed spears were offered unheeded at his life but the savages respected his rank and calmness even in their fury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dangerous weapons were brushed aside by the still nervous arm of the veteran or fell of themselves after menacing an act that it would seem no one had courage to perform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately the vindictive magua was searching for his victim in the very band the veteran had just quitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shrieked alice as he passed at no great distance without appearing to heed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cry was repeated and in terms and tones that might have melted a heart of stone but it was unanswered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once indeed the old man appeared to catch the sound for he paused and listened but alice had dropped senseless on the earth and cora had sunk at her side hovering in untiring tenderness over her lifeless form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> munro shook his head in disappointment and proceeded bent on the high duty of his station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lady said gamut who helpless and useless as he was had not yet dreamed of deserting his trust it is the jubilee of the devils and this is not a meet place for christians to tarry in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go said cora still gazing at her unconscious sister save thyself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to me thou canst not be of further use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david comprehended the unyielding character of her resolution by the simple but expressive gesture that accompanied her words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gazed for a moment at the dusky forms that were acting their hellish rites on every side of him and his tall person grew more erect while his chest heaved and every feature swelled and seemed to speak with the power of the feelings by which he was governed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the jewish boy might tame the great spirit of saul by the sound of his harp and the words of sacred song it may not be amiss he said to try the potency of music here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then raising his voice to its highest tone he poured out a strain so powerful as to be heard even amid the din of that bloody field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more than one savage rushed toward them thinking to rifle the unprotected sisters of their attire and bear away their scalps but when they found this strange and unmoved figure riveted to his post they paused to listen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> astonishment soon changed to admiration and they passed on to other and less courageous victims openly expressing their satisfaction at the firmness with which the white warrior sang his death song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> encouraged and deluded by his success david exerted all his powers to extend what he believed so holy an influence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the unwonted sounds caught the ears of a distant savage who flew raging from group to group like one who scorning to touch the vulgar herd hunted for some victim more worthy of his renown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was magua who uttered a yell of pleasure when he beheld his ancient prisoners again at his mercy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come he said laying his soiled hands on the dress of cora the wigwam of the huron is still open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried cora veiling her eyes from his revolting aspect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the indian laughed tauntingly as he held up his reeking hand and answered it is red but it comes from white veins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is blood oceans of blood upon thy soul thy spirit has moved this scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returned the exulting savage will the darkhair go to his tribe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strike if thou wilt and complete thy revenge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hesitated a moment and then catching the light and senseless form of alice in his arms the subtle indian moved swiftly across the plain toward the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shrieked cora following wildly on his footsteps release the child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but magua was deaf to her voice or rather he knew his power and was determined to maintain it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the holy charm is beginning to be felt and soon shalt thou see this horrid tumult stilled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perceiving that in his turn he was unheeded the faithful david followed the distracted sister raising his voice again in sacred song and sweeping the air to the measure with his long arm in diligent accompaniment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this manner they traversed the plain through the flying the wounded and the dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fierce huron was at any time sufficient for himself and the victim that he bore though cora would have fallen more than once under the blows of her savage enemies but for the extraordinary being who stalked in her rear and who now appeared to the astonished natives gifted with the protecting spirit of madness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> magua who knew how to avoid the more pressing dangers and also to elude pursuit entered the woods through a low ravine where he quickly found the narragansetts which the travelers had abandoned so shortly before awaiting his appearance in custody of a savage as fierce and malign in his expression as himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laying alice on one of the horses he made a sign to cora to mount the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> notwithstanding the horror excited by the presence of her captor there was a present relief in escaping from the bloody scene enacting on the plain to which cora could not be altogether insensible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took her seat and held forth her arms for her sister with an air of entreaty and love that even the huron could not deny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> placing alice then on the same animal with cora he seized the bridle and commenced his route by plunging deeper into the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david perceiving that he was left alone utterly disregarded as a subject too worthless even to destroy threw his long limb across the saddle of the beast they had deserted and made such progress in the pursuit as the difficulties of the path permitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they soon began to ascend but as the motion had a tendency to revive the dormant faculties of her sister the attention of cora was too much divided between the tenderest solicitude in her behalf and in listening to the cries which were still too audible on the plain to note the direction in which they journeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when however they gained the flattened surface of the mountaintop and approached the eastern precipice she recognized the spot to which she had once before been led under the more friendly auspices of the scout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here magua suffered them to dismount and notwithstanding their own captivity the curiosity which seems inseparable from horror induced them to gaze at the sickening sight below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on every side the captured were flying before their relentless persecutors while the armed columns of the christian king stood fast in an apathy which has never been explained and which has left an immovable blot on the otherwise fair escutcheon of their leader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor was the sword of death stayed until cupidity got the mastery of revenge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then indeed the shrieks of the wounded and the yells of their murderers grew less frequent until finally the cries of horror were lost to their ear or were drowned in the loud long and piercing whoops of the triumphant savages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why anything an honorable murderer if you will for the bloody and inhuman scene rather incidentally mentioned than described in the preceding chapter is conspicuous in the pages of colonial history by the merited title of the massacre of william henry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it so far deepened the stain which a previous and very similar event had left upon the reputation of the french commander that it was not entirely erased by his early and glorious death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is now becoming obscured by time and thousands who know that montcalm died like a hero on the plains of abraham have yet to learn how much he was deficient in that moral courage without which no man can be truly great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pages might yet be written to prove from this illustrious example the defects of human excellence to show how easy it is for generous sentiments high courtesy and chivalrous courage to lose their influence beneath the chilling blight of selfishness and to exhibit to the world a man who was great in all the minor attributes of character but who was found wanting when it became necessary to prove how much principle is superior to policy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the task would exceed our prerogatives and as history like love is so apt to surround her heroes with an atmosphere of imaginary brightness it is probable that louis de saint veran will be viewed by posterity only as the gallant defender of his country while his cruel apathy on the shores of the oswego and of the horican will be forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deeply regretting this weakness on the part of a sister muse we shall at once retire from her sacred precincts within the proper limits of our own humble vocation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third day from the capture of the fort was drawing to a close but the business of the narrative must still detain the reader on the shores of the holy lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when last seen the environs of the works were filled with violence and uproar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were now possessed by stillness and death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bloodstained conquerors had departed and their camp which had so lately rung with the merry rejoicings of a victorious army lay a silent and deserted city of huts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fortress was a smoldering ruin charred rafters fragments of exploded artillery and rent masonwork covering its earthen mounds in confused disorder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a frightful change had also occurred in the season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun had hid its warmth behind an impenetrable mass of vapor and hundreds of human forms which had blackened beneath the fierce heats of august were stiffening in their deformity before the blasts of a premature november <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the curling and spotless mists which had been seen sailing above the hills toward the north were now returning in an interminable dusky sheet that was urged along by the fury of a tempest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowded mirror of the horican was gone and in its place the green and angry waters lashed the shores as if indignantly casting back its impurities to the polluted strand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still the clear fountain retained a portion of its charmed influence but it reflected only the somber gloom that fell from the impending heavens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that humid and congenial atmosphere which commonly adorned the view veiling its harshness and softening its asperities had disappeared the northern air poured across the waste of water so harsh and unmingled that nothing was left to be conjectured by the eye or fashioned by the fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fiercer element had cropped the verdure of the plain which looked as though it were scathed by the consuming lightning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here and there a dark green tuft rose in the midst of the desolation the earliest fruits of a soil that had been fattened with human blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole landscape which seen by a favoring light and in a genial temperature had been found so lovely appeared now like some pictured allegory of life in which objects were arrayed in their harshest but truest colors and without the relief of any shadowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the solitary and arid blades of grass arose from the passing gusts fearfully perceptible the bold and rocky mountains were too distinct in their barrenness and the eye even sought relief in vain by attempting to pierce the illimitable void of heaven which was shut to its gaze by the dusky sheet of ragged and driving vapor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind blew unequally sometimes sweeping heavily along the ground seeming to whisper its moanings in the cold ears of the dead then rising in a shrill and mournful whistling it entered the forest with a rush that filled the air with the leaves and branches it scattered in its path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amid the unnatural shower a few hungry ravens struggled with the gale but no sooner was the green ocean of woods which stretched beneath them passed than they gladly stopped at random to their hideous banquet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short it was a scene of wildness and desolation and it appeared as if all who had profanely entered it had been stricken at a blow by the relentless arm of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was then perfectly easy and indeed the maids behaviour spoke for itself for a modester quieter soberer girl never came into anybodys family and i found her so afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i was well enough to go abroad i went with the maid to see the house and to see the apartment i was to have and everything was so handsome and so clean and well that in short i had nothing to say but was wonderfully pleased and satisfied with what i had met with which considering the melancholy circumstances i was in was far beyond what i looked for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might be expected that i should give some account of the nature of the wicked practices of this woman in whose hands i was now fallen but it would be too much encouragement to the vice to let the world see what easy measures were here taken to rid the womens unwelcome burthen of a child clandestinely gotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this grave matron had several sorts of practice and this was one particular that if a child was born though not in her house for she had occasion to be called to many private labours she had people at hand who for a piece of money would take the child off their hands and off from the hands of the parish too and those children as she said were honestly provided for and taken care of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what should become of them all considering so many as by her account she was concerned with i cannot conceive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had many times discourses upon that subject with her but she was full of this argument that she save the life of many an innocent lamb as she called them which would otherwise perhaps have been murdered and of many women who made desperate by the misfortune would otherwise be tempted to destroy their children and bring themselves to the gallows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i granted her that this was true and a very commendable thing provided the poor children fell into good hands afterwards and were not abused starved and neglected by the nurses that bred them up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she answered that she always took care of that and had no nurses in her business but what were very good honest people and such as might be depended upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could say nothing to the contrary and so was obliged to say madam i do not question you do your part honestly but what those people do afterwards is the main question and she stopped my mouth again with saying that she took the utmost care about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only thing i found in all her conversation on these subjects that gave me any distaste was that one time in discouraging about my being far gone with child and the time i expected to come she said something that looked as if she could help me off with my burthen sooner if i was willing or in english that she could give me something to make me miscarry if i had a desire to put an end to my troubles that way but i soon let her see that i abhorred the thoughts of it and to do her justice she put it off so cleverly that i could not say she really intended it or whether she only mentioned the practice as a horrible thing for she couched her words so well and took my meaning so quickly that she gave her negative before i could explain myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to bring this part into as narrow a compass as possible i quitted my lodging at st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joness and went to my new governess for so they called her in the house and there i was indeed treated with so much courtesy so carefully looked to so handsomely provided and everything so well that i was surprised at it and could not at first see what advantage my governess made of it but i found afterwards that she professed to make no profit of lodgers diet nor indeed could she get much by it but that her profit lay in the other articles of her management and she made enough that way i assure you for tis scarce credible what practice she had as well abroad as at home and yet all upon the private account or in plain english the whoring account <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while i was in her house which was near four months she had no less than twelve ladies of pleasure brought to bed within the doors and i think she had twoandthirty or thereabouts under her conduct without doors whereof one as nice as she was with me was lodged with my old landlady at st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a strange testimony of the growing vice of the age and such a one that as bad as i had been myself it shocked my very senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to nauseate the place i was in and about all the wicked practice and yet i must say that i never saw or do i believe there was to be seen the least indecency in the house the whole time i was there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a man was ever seen to come upstairs except to visit the lyingin ladies within their month nor then without the old lady with them who made it a piece of honour of her management that no man should touch a woman no not his own wife within the month nor would she permit any man to lie in the house upon any pretence whatever no not though she was sure it was with his own wife and her general saying for it was that she cared not how many children were born in her house but she would have none got there if she could help it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might perhaps be carried further than was needful but it was an error of the right hand if it was an error for by this she kept up the reputation such as it was of her business and obtained this character that though she did take care of the women when they were debauched yet she was not instrumental to their being debauched at all and yet it was a wicked trade she drove too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while i was there and before i was brought to bed i received a letter from my trustee at the bank full of kind obliging things and earnestly pressing me to return to london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was near a fortnight old when it came to me because it had been first sent into lancashire and then returned to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he concludes with telling me that he had obtained a decree i think he called it against his wife and that he would be ready to make good his engagement to me if i would accept of him adding a great many protestations of kindness and affection such as he would have been far from offering if he had known the circumstances i had been in and which as it was i had been very far from deserving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i returned an answer to his letter and dated it at liverpool but sent it by messenger alleging that it came in cover to a friend in town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave him joy of his deliverance but raised some scruples at the lawfulness of his marrying again and told him i supposed he would consider very seriously upon that point before he resolved on it the consequence being too great for a man of his judgment to venture rashly upon a thing of that nature so concluded wishing him very well in whatever he resolved without letting him into anything of my own mind or giving any answer to his proposal of my coming to london to him but mentioned at a distance my intention to return the i was brought to bed about the middle of may and had another brave boy and myself in as good condition as usual on such occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my governess did her part as a midwife with the greatest art and dexterity imaginable and far beyond all that ever i had had any experience of before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her care of me in my travail and after in my lying in was such that if she had been my own mother it could not have been better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let none be encouraged in their loose practices from this dexterous ladys management for she is gone to her place and i dare say has left nothing behind her that can or will come up on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i had been brought to bed about twentytwo days when i received another letter from my friend at the bank with the surprising news that he had obtained a final sentence of divorce against his wife and had served her with it on such a day and that he had such an answer to give to all my scruples about his marrying again as i could not expect and as he had no desire of for that his wife who had been under some remorse before for her usage of him as soon as she had the account that he had gained his point had very unhappily destroyed herself that same evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he expressed himself very handsomely as to his being concerned at her disaster but cleared himself of having any hand in it and that he had only done himself justice in a case in which he was notoriously injured and abused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however he said that he was extremely afflicted at it and had no view of any satisfaction left in his world but only in the hope that i would come and relieve him by my company and then he pressed me violently indeed to give him some hopes that i would at least come up to town and let him see me when he would further enter into discourse about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was exceedingly surprised at the news and began now seriously to reflect on my present circumstances and the inexpressible misfortune it was to me to have a child upon my hands and what to do in it i knew not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last i opened my case at a distance to my governess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i appeared melancholy and uneasy for several days and she lay at me continually to know what trouble me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not for my life tell her that i had an offer of marriage after i had so often told her that i had a husband so that i really knew not what to say to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i owned i had something which very much troubled me but at the same time told her i could not speak of it to any one alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued importuning me several days but it was impossible i told her for me to commit the secret to anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this instead of being an answer to her increased her importunities she urged her having been trusted with the greatest secrets of this nature that it was her business to conceal everything and that to discover things of that nature would be her ruin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked me if ever i had found her tattling to me of other peoples affairs and how could i suspect her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me to unfold myself to her was telling it to nobody that she was silent as death that it must be a very strange case indeed that she could not help me out of but to conceal it was to deprive myself of all possible help or means of help and to deprive her of the opportunity of serving me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short she had such a bewitching eloquence and so great a power of persuasion that there was no concealing anything from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i resolved to unbosom myself to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told her the history of my lancashire marriage and how both of us had been disappointed how we came together and how we parted how he absolutely discharged me as far as lay in him free liberty to marry again protesting that if he knew it he would never claim me or disturb or expose me that i thought i was free but was dreadfully afraid to venture for fear of the consequences that might follow in case of a discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i told her what a good offer i had showed her my friends two last letters inviting me to come to london and let her see with what affection and earnestness they were written but blotted out the name and also the story about the disaster of his wife only that she was dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she fell alaughing at my scruples about marrying and told me the other was no marriage but a cheat on both sides and that as we were parted by mutual consent the nature of the contract was destroyed and the obligation was mutually discharged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had arguments for this at the tip of her tongue and in short reasoned me out of my reason not but that it was too by the help of my own inclination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then came the great and main difficulty and that was the child this she told me in so many words must be removed and that so as that it should never be possible for any one to discover it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew there was no marrying without entirely concealing that i had had a child for he would soon have discovered by the age of it that it was born nay and gotten too since my parley with him and that would have destroyed all the affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it touched my heart so forcibly to think of parting entirely with the child and for aught i knew of having it murdered or starved by neglect and illusage which was much the same that i could not think of it without horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish all those women who consent to the disposing their children out of the way as it is called for decency sake would consider that tis only a contrived method for murder that is to say akilling their children with safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ithaca lay now in about five feet of water and the war prahus of muda saffir rode upon her seaward side so that those who manned them did not see the twelve who splashed through the water from land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never before had any of the rescuers seen a larger body of water than the little stream which wound through their campong but accidents and experiments in that had taught them the danger of submerging their heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not swim but all were large and strong so that they were able to push their way rapidly through the water to the very side of the ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here they found difficulty in reaching the deck but in a moment number thirteen had solved the problem by requiring one of the taller of his crew to stand close in by the ship while the others clambered upon his shoulders and from there to the ithacas deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> number thirteen was the first to pull himself over the vessels side and as he did so he saw some half dozen dyaks preparing to quit her upon the opposite side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were the last of the boarding partythe girl was nowhere in sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without waiting for his men the young giant sprang across the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his one thought was to find virginia maxon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sound of his approach the dyak turned and at the sight of a pajama clad white man armed only with a long whip they emitted savage cries of anticipation counting the handsome trophy upon the white ones shoulders as already theirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> number thirteen would have paid no attention whatever to them had they not molested him for he wished only to reach the girls side as quickly as possible but in another moment he found himself confronted by a half dozen dancing wild men brandishing wicked looking parangs and crying tauntingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up went the great bull whip and without abating his speed a particle the man leaped into the midst of the wicked blades that menaced him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right and left with the quickness of thought the heavy lash fell upon heads shoulders and sword arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no chance to wield a blade in the face of that terrific onslaught for the whip fell not with the ordinary force of a manheld lash but with all the stupendous power of those giant shoulders and arms behind it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a single blow felled the foremost head hunter breaking his shoulder and biting into the flesh and bone as a heavy sword bites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again and again the merciless leather fell while in the boats below muda saffir and his men shouted loud cries of encouragement to their companions on the ship and a wideeyed girl in the stern of muda saffirs own prahu looked on in terror hope and admiration at the man of her own race whom she felt was battling against all these odds for her alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> virginia maxon recognized her champion instantly as he who had fought for her and saved her once before from the hideous creature of her fathers experiments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with hands tight pressed against her bosom the girl leaned forward tense with excitement watching every move of the lithe giant figure as silhouetted against the brazen tropic sky it towered above the dancing shrieking head hunters who writhed beneath the awful lash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> muda saffir saw that the battle was going against his men and it filled him with anger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turning to one of his headmen he ordered two more boatloads of warriors to the ithacas deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they were rushing to obey their leaders command there was a respite in the fighting on the ship for the three who had not fallen beneath the bull whip had leaped overboard to escape the fate which had overtaken their comrades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the reinforcements started to scale the vessels side number thirteens searching eyes found the girl in muda saffirs prahu where it lay a little off from the ithaca and as the first of the enemy clambered over the rail she saw a smile of encouragement light the clear cut features of the man above her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> virginia maxon sent back an answering smilea smile that filled the young giants heart with pride and happiness such a smile as brave men have been content to fight and die for since woman first learned the art of smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> number thirteen could have beaten back many of the reinforcing party before they reached the deck but he did not care to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the spontaneous ethics of the man there seemed no place for an unfair advantage over an enemy and added to this was his newly acquired love of battle so he was content to wait until his foes stood on an even footing with him before he engaged them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they never came within reach of his ready lash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead as they came above the ships side they paused wideeyed and terror stricken and with cries of fear and consternation dropped precipitately back into the sea shouting warnings to those who were about to scale the hull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> muda saffir arose in his prahu cursing and reviling the frightened dyaks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not know the cause of their alarm but presently he saw it behind the giant upon the ithacas deck eleven horrible monstrosities lumbering forward snarling and growling to their leaders side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sight his own dark countenance went ashen and with trembling lips he ordered his oarsmen to pull for the open sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl too saw the frightful creatures that surrounded the man upon the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought that they were about to attack him and gave a little cry of warning but in another instant she realized that they were his companions for with him they rushed to the side of the ship to stand for a moment looking down upon the struggling dyaks in the water below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two prahus lay directly beneath them and into these the head hunters were scrambling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the balance of the flotilla was now making rapid headway under oars and sail toward the mouth of the harbor and as number thirteen saw that the girl was being borne away from him he shouted a command to his misshapen crew and without waiting to see if they would follow him leaped into the nearer of the two boats beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was already half filled with dyaks some of whom were hastily manning the oars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> others of the head hunters were scrambling over the gunwale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant pandemonium reigned in the little vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> savage warriors sprang toward the tall figure towering above them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bull whip hissed and cracked and then into the midst of it all came a horrid avalanche of fearful and grotesque monsters the young giants crew had followed at his command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the asteroid passed several hundred yards from the projectile and disappeared not so much from the rapidity of its course as that its face being opposite the moon it was suddenly merged into the perfect darkness of space <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a happy journey to you exclaimed michel ardan with a sigh of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely infinity of space is large enough for a poor little projectile to walk through without fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now what is this portentous globe which nearly struck us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is said barbicane a simple meteorite but an enormous one which the attraction of the earth has retained as a satellite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed michel ardan the earth then has two moons like neptune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes my friends two moons though it passes generally for having only one but this second moon is so small and its speed so great that the inhabitants of the earth cannot see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was by noticing disturbances that a french astronomer m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petit was able to determine the existence of this second satellite and calculate its elements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to his observations this meteorite will accomplish its revolution around the earth in three hours and twenty minutes which implies a wonderful rate of speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no replied barbicane but if like us they had met it they could no longer doubt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed i think that this meteorite which had it struck the projectile would have much embarrassed us will give us the means of deciding what our position in space is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because its distance is known and when we met it we were exactly four thousand six hundred and fifty miles from the surface of the terrestrial globe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more than two thousand french leagues exclaimed michel ardan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that beats the express trains of the pitiful globe called the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think so replied nicholl consulting his chronometer it is eleven oclock and it is only thirteen minutes since we left the american continent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said nicholl and if our initiatory speed of twelve thousand yards has been kept up we shall have made about twenty thousand miles in the hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is all very well my friends said the president but the insoluble question still remains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did we not hear the detonation of the columbiad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for want of an answer the conversation dropped and barbicane began thoughtfully to let down the shutter of the second side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he succeeded and through the uncovered glass the moon filled the projectile with a brilliant light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholl as an economical man put out the gas now useless and whose brilliancy prevented any observation of the interplanetary space <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her rays no longer filtered through the vapory atmosphere of the terrestrial globe shone through the glass filling the air in the interior of the projectile with silvery reflections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the black curtain of the firmament in reality heightened the moons brilliancy which in this void of ether unfavorable to diffusion did not eclipse the neighboring stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heavens thus seen presented quite a new aspect and one which the human eye could never dream of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one may conceive the interest with which these bold men watched the orb of night the great aim of their journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in its motion the earths satellite was insensibly nearing the zenith the mathematical point which it ought to attain ninetysix hours later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her mountains her plains every projection was as clearly discernible to their eyes as if they were observing it from some spot upon the earth but its light was developed through space with wonderful intensity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the earth flying from under their feet the travelers had lost all recollection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was captain nicholl who first recalled their attention to the vanishing globe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said michel ardan do not let us be ungrateful to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since we are leaving our country let our last looks be directed to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish to see the earth once more before it is quite hidden from my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to satisfy his companions barbicane began to uncover the window at the bottom of the projectile which would allow them to observe the earth direct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the disc which the force of the projection had beaten down to the base was removed not without difficulty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its fragments placed carefully against a wall might serve again upon occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a circular gap appeared nineteen inches in diameter hollowed out of the lower part of the projectile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a glass cover six inches thick and strengthened with upper fastenings closed it tightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath was fixed an aluminum plate held in place by bolts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the screws being undone and the bolts let go the plate fell down and visible communication was established between the interior and the exterior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in four days when the moon will be full at the very time we shall reach it the earth will be new and will only appear to us as a slender crescent which will soon disappear and for some days will be enveloped in utter darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeated michel ardan looking with all his eyes at the thin slip of his native planet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the explanation given by president barbicane was correct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earth with respect to the projectile was entering its last phase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in its octant and showed a crescent finely traced on the dark background of the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its light rendered bluish by the thick strata of the atmosphere was less intense than that of the crescent moon but it was of considerable dimensions and looked like an enormous arch stretched across the firmament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some parts brilliantly lighted especially on its concave part showed the presence of high mountains often disappearing behind thick spots which are never seen on the lunar disc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were rings of clouds placed concentrically round the terrestrial globe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the travelers were trying to pierce the profound darkness a brilliant cluster of shooting stars burst upon their eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hundreds of meteorites ignited by the friction of the atmosphere irradiated the shadow of the luminous train and lined the cloudy parts of the disc with their fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this period the earth was in its perihelion and the month of december is so propitious to these shooting stars that astronomers have counted as many as twentyfour thousand in an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but michel ardan disdaining scientific reasonings preferred thinking that the earth was thus saluting the departure of her three children with her most brilliant fireworks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed this was all they saw of the globe lost in the solar world rising and setting to the great planets like a simple morning or evening star <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this globe where they had left all their affections was nothing more than a fugitive crescent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long did the three friends look without speaking though united in heart while the projectile sped onward with an everdecreasing speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then an irresistible drowsiness crept over their brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt for after the overexcitement of those last hours passed upon earth reaction was inevitable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said nicholl since we must sleep let us sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and stretching themselves on their couches they were all three soon in a profound slumber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they had not forgotten themselves more than a quarter of an hour when barbicane sat up suddenly and rousing his companions i have found it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reason why we did not hear the detonation of the columbiad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because our projectile traveled faster than the sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this curious but certainly correct explanation once given the three friends returned to their slumbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could they have found a calmer or more peaceful spot to sleep in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the earth houses towns cottages and country feel every shock given to the exterior of the globe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on sea the vessels rocked by the waves are still in motion in the air the balloon oscillates incessantly on the fluid strata of divers densities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this projectile alone floating in perfect space in the midst of perfect silence offered perfect repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus the sleep of our adventurous travelers might have been indefinitely prolonged if an unexpected noise had not awakened them at about seven oclock in the morning of the nd of december eight hours after their departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they looked and found one of the animals crouched under the divan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> terrified and shaken by the initiatory shock it had remained in the corner till its voice returned with the pangs of hunger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the amiable diana still very confused who crept out of her retreat though not without much persuasion michel ardan encouraging her with most gracious words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a horrible thought passed through the dutchmans mind and he shuddered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what has come over you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked round his studio wearily he had loved it because her presence had made it gay and homelike he shut his eyes for an instant then he gave her a long look as though to impress on his mind the picture of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant bear to think of you living in that horrible filthy attic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all this is your home just as much as mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll be spared at least the worst privations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went to the drawer in which he kept his money and took out several banknotes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would like to give you half what ive got here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you pack up my clothes and leave them with the concierge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im grateful for all the happiness you gave me in the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked out and closed the door behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with my minds eye i saw strickland throw his hat on a table and sitting down begin to smoke a cigarette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i kept silence for a little while thinking of what stroeve had told me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not stomach his weakness and he saw my disapproval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know as well as i do how strickland lived he said tremulously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt let her live in those circumstances i simply couldnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she had to put up with certain inconveniences it was her own lookout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but you see you dont love her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strickland isnt the man to make a woman happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want her to know that i shall never fail her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does that mean that youre prepared to take her back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why shell want me more than ever then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when shes alone and humiliated and broken it would be dreadful if she had nowhere to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose it was commonplace in me that i felt slightly outraged at his lack of spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt expect her to love me as i loved her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not the sort of man that women love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant blame her if shes fallen in love with strickland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you certainly have less vanity than any man ive ever known i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i love her so much better than myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me that when vanity comes into love it can only be because really you love yourself best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all it constantly happens that a man when hes married falls in love with somebody else when he gets over it he returns to his wife and she takes him back and everyone thinks it very natural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dare say thats logical i smiled but most men are made differently and they cant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while i talked to stroeve i was puzzling over the suddenness of the whole affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not imagine that he had had no warning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remembered the curious look i had seen in blanche stroeves eyes perhaps its explanation was that she was growing dimly conscious of a feeling in her heart that surprised and alarmed her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you have no suspicion before today that there was anything between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a pencil on the table and unconsciously he drew a head on the blottingpaper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please say so if you hate my asking you questions i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh if you knew the frightful anguish in my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why on earth didnt you send strickland packing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was more than improbable it was incredible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see ive always been jealous but i trained myself never to show it i was jealous of every man she knew i was jealous of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew she didnt love me as i loved her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she allowed me to love her and that was enough to make me happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forced myself to go out for hours together in order to leave them by themselves i wanted to punish myself for suspicions which were unworthy of me and when i came back i found they didnt want me not strickland he didnt care if i was there or not but blanche <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shuddered when i went to kiss her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when at last i was certain i didnt know what to do i knew theyd only laugh at me if i made a scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought if i held my tongue and pretended not to see everything would come right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made up my mind to get him away quietly without quarrelling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh if you only knew what ive suffered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he told me again of his asking strickland to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he chose his moment carefully and tried to make his request sound casual but he could not master the trembling of his voice and he felt himself that into words that he wished to seem jovial and friendly there crept the bitterness of his jealousy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not expected strickland to take him up on the spot and make his preparations to go there and then above all he had not expected his wifes decision to go with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw that now he wished with all his heart that he had held his tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he preferred the anguish of jealousy to the anguish of separation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to kill him and i only made a fool of myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was silent for a long time and then he said what i knew was in his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if id only waited perhaps it would have gone all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh poor child what have i driven her to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shrugged my shoulders but did not speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no sympathy for blanche stroeve but knew that it would only pain poor dirk if i told him exactly what i thought of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had reached that stage of exhaustion when he could not stop talking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went over again every word of the scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they swarmed the forward deck and rigging like a plague of unclean monkeys climbing with an agility and nimbleness that made wilbur sick to his stomach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were unlike any chinamen he had ever seenhideous to a degree that he had imagined impossible in a human being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on two occasions a fight developed and in an instant the little hatchets were flashing like the flash of a snakes fangs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toward the end of the day one of them returned to the junk screaming like a stuck pig a bit of his chin bitten off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moran and wilbur kept to the quarterdeck always within reach of the huge cuttingin spades but the chinese beachcombers were too elated over their prize to pay them much attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and indeed the dead monster proved a veritable treasuretrove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the end of the day he had been triced up to the foremast and all hands straining at the windlass had raised the mighty head out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chinamen descended upon the smooth black body their bare feet sliding and slipping at every step <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they held on by jabbing their knives into the hide as glacierclimbers do their icepicks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the head yielded barrel after barrel of oil and a fair quantity of bone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blubber was taken aboard the junk minced up with hatchets and run into casks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last of all a chinaman cut a hole through the case and actually descending into the inside of the head stripped away the spermaceti clear as crystal and packed it into buckets which were hauled up on the junks deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the work occupied some two or three days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during this time the bertha millner was keeled over to nearly twenty degrees by the weight of the dead monster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chinamen would do as they pleased that was said and signed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they did not release the schooner until the whale had been emptied of oil and blubber spermaceti and bone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length on the afternoon of the third day the captain of the junk whose name was hoang presented himself upon the quarter deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was naked to the waist and his bare brown torso was gleaming with oil and sweat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his queue was coiled like a snake around his neck his hatchet thrust into his belt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wilbur caught his breath as the two stood there facing each other so sharp was the contrast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man the mongolian small weazened leathercolored secretivea strange complex creature steeped in all the obscure mystery of the east nervous ill at ease and the girl the anglosaxon daughter of the northmen huge blond bigboned frank outspoken simple of composition open as the day bareheaded her great ropes of sandy hair falling over her breast and almost to the top of her kneeboots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he looked at the two wilbur asked himself where else but in california could such abrupt contrasts occur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all light announced hoang catchum all oil catchum all bone catchum all same plenty many <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the three principals came to a settlement with unprecedented directness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like all chinamen hoang was true to his promises and he had already set apart three and a half barrels of spermaceti ten barrels of oil and some twenty pounds of bone as the schooners share in the transaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called their attention to the discharge of his obligations and hurried away to summon his men aboard and get the junk under way again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beachcombers returned to their junk and wilbur and moran set about cutting the carcass of the whale adrift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they found it would be easier to cut away the hide from around the hooks and loops of the tackle than to unfasten the tackle itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the knots are jammed hard as steel declared moran <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hand up that cuttingin spade stand by with the other and cut loose at the same time as i do so we can ease off the strain on these lines at the same time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moran set free the hook in the loop of black skin in a couple of strokes but wilbur was more clumsy the skin resisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he struck at it sharply with the heavy spade the blade hit the iron hook glanced off and opened a large slit in the carcass below the head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gush of entrails started from the slit and moran swore under her breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have the mast out of her next steady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wilbur had nerved himself against the dreadful stench he expected would issue from the putrid monster but he was surprised to note a pungent sweet and spicy odor that all at once made thick the air about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an aromatic smell stronger than that of the salt ocean stronger even than the reek of oil and blubber from the schooners waistsweet as incense penetrating as attar delicious as a summer breeze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it smells pretty good whatever it is he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moran came up to where he stood and looked at the slit he had made in the whales carcass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of it was bulging some kind of dull white matter marbled with gray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a hard lump of irregular shape and about as big as a hogshead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moran glanced over to the junk some forty feet distant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after them a silence in which the memory of the music seemed to beat to beat ever more faintly through every quivering nerve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from me all fear all apprehension had fled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in their place was nothing but joyous anticipation a supernal free dom from even the shadow of the shadow of care or sorrow not now did anything matterolaf or his haunted hate filled eyes throckmartin or his fatenothing of pain noth ing of agony nothing of striving nor endeavour nor despair in that wide outer world that had turned suddenly to a troubled dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more the first great note pealed out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more it died and from the clustered spheres a kaleidoscopic blaze shot as though drawn from the majestic sound itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the manycoloured rays darted across the white waters and sought the face of the irised veil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they touched it spar kled flamed wavered and shook with fountains of prismatic colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light increasedand in its intensity the silver air darkened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faded into shadow that white mosaic of flower crowned faces set in the amphitheatre of jet and vast shad ows dropped upon the highflung tiers and shrouded them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on the skirts of the rays the fretted stalls in which we sat with the fairhaired ones blazed out iridescent like jewels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sensible of an acceleration of every pulse a wild stimulation of every nerve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt myself being lifted above the worldclose to the threshold of the high godssoon their essence and their power would stream out into me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked at olafand in his face was none of thisonly hate and hate and hate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the peacock waves streamed out over the waters cleaving the seeming darkness a rainbow path of glory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the veil flashed as though all the rainbows that had ever shone were burning within it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into the centre of the veil the light drew itself grew into an intolerable brightnessand with a storm of tinklings a tempest of crystalline notes a tumult of tiny chimings through it spedthe shining one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straight down that radiant path its highflung plumes of feathery flame shimmering its coruscating spirals whirling its seven globes of seven colours shining above its glowing core it raced toward us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hurricane of bells of diamond glass were jubilant joyous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt okeefe grip my arm yolara threw her white arms out in a welcoming gesture i heard from the tier a sigh of raptureand in it a poignant wailing undertone of agony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the waters down the light stream to the end of the ivory pier flew the shining one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through its crystal pizzicati drifted inarticulate murmuringsdeadly sweet stilling the heart and setting it leaping madly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment it paused poised itself and then came whirling down the flower path to its priestess slowly ever more slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it hovered for a moment between the woman and the dwarf as though contemplating them turned to her with its storm of tinklings softened its murmurings infinitely caressing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bent toward it yolara seemed to gather within herself pulsing waves of power she was terrifying glori ously maddeningly evil and as gloriously maddeningly heavenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a queen of hell and a princess of heavenin one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only for a moment did that which we had called the dweller and which these named the shining one pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it swept up the ramp to the dais rested there slowly turning plumes and spirals lacing and unlacing throbbing pulsing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now its nucleus grew plainer strongerhuman in a fashion and all inhuman neither man nor woman neither god nor devil subtly partaking of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor could i doubt that what ever it was within that shining nucleus was something sen tient something that had will and energy and in some aw ful supernormal fashionintelligence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another trumpetinga sound of stones openinga long low wail of utter anguishsomething moved shadowy in the river of light and slowly at first then ever more rapidly shapes swam through it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were half a score of them girls and youths women and men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they drew closer and in the eyes of each and in their faces was the bud of that awful inter mingling of emotions of joy and sorrow ecstasy and terror that i had seen in full blossom on throckmartins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing began again its murmuringsnow infinitely caressing coaxinglike the song of a siren from some witched star <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the bellsounds rang outcompellingly i saw olaf lean far out of his place saw halfconsciously at lugurs signal three of the dwarfs creep in and take places unnoticed behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the first of the figures rushed upon the daisand paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the girl who had been brought before yolara when the gnome named songar was driven into the nothing ness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with all the quickness of light a spiral of the shining one stretched out and encircled her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at its touch there was an infinitely dreadful shrinking and it seemed a simultaneous hurling of herself into its radiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it wrapped its swirls around her permeated her the crystal chorus burst forthtumultuously through and through her the radiance pulsed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> began then that infinitely dreadful but infinitely glorious rhythm they called the dance of the shining one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as the girl swirled within its spar kling mists another and another flew into its embrace until at last the dais was an incredible vision a mad stars witches sabbath an altar of white faces and bodies gleam ing through living flame transfused with rapture insupport able and horror that was hellishand ever radiant plumes and spirals expanding the core of the shining one waxed growing greateras it consumed as it drew into and through itself the lifeforce of these lost ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they spun interlacedand there began to pulse from them life vitality as though the very essence of nature was filling us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dimly i recognized that what i was beholding was vampirism inconceivable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then whirling bellnotes storming the shining one with drew slowly from the dais down the ramp still embracing still interwoven with those who had thrown themselves into its spirals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they drifted with it as though halfcarried in dreadful dance white faces sealedforeverinto that sem blance of those who held within linked god and devili covered my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard a gasp from okeefe opened my eyes and sought his saw the wildness vanish from them as he strained for ward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olaf had leaned far out and as he did so the dwarfs beside him caught him and whether by design or through his own swift involuntary movement thrust him half into the dwellers path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dweller paused in its gyrationsseemed to watch him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the norsemans face was crimson his eyes blazing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he threw himself back and with one defiant shout gripped one of the dwarfs about the middle and sent him hurtling through the air straight at the radiant thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a whirling mass of legs and arms the dwarf flewthen in mid flight stopped as though some gigantic invisible hand had caught him andwas dashed down upon the platform not a yard from the shining one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the dweller shot a shimmering tentacletouched him recoiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its crystal tinklings changed into an angry chim ing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from all aboutjewelled stalls and jet peakcame a sigh of incredulous horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the instant larry was over the low barrier between the pillars rushing to the norsemans side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and even as they ran there was another wild shout from olaf and he hurled himself out straight at the throat of the dweller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before he could touch the shining one now motion lessand never was the thing more horrible than then with the purely human suggestion of surprise plain in its poise larry had struck him aside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried to followand was held by rador <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his face was incredulous hope inexplicable eagerness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shining one stretched out a slow spiral and as it did so i saw the bravest thing man has ever witnessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly okeefe thrust himself between it and olaf pistol out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tentacle touched him and the dull blue of his robe flashed out into blinding intense azure light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the automatic in his gloved hand came three quick bursts of flame straight into the thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lugur paused his hand darted up and in it was one of the silver keth cones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before he could flash it upon the norseman larry had unlooped his robe thrown its fold over olaf and holding him with one hand away from the shining one thrust with the other his pistol into the dwarfs stomach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his lips moved but i could not hear what he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now yolara was thereall this had taken barely more than five seconds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thrust herself between the three men and the dweller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spoke to itand the wild buzzing died down the gay crystal tinklings burst forth again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing murmured to herbegan to whirlfaster fasterpassed down the ivory pier out upon the waters bearing with it meshed in its light the sacrificesswept on ever more swiftly triumphantly and turning turning with its ghastly crew vanished through the veil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from all the amphitheatre arose a clamour a shouting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marakinoff his eyes staring was lean ing out listening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unrestrained now by rador i vaulted the wall and rushed forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not before i had heard the there is something stronger than the shining one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olaf panting eyes glazed trembling shrank beneath my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both these men lugur was raging they shall dance with the shining one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this man is mine said the priestess and her voice was menacing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have told you i dare not for this one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither this man nor this said larry shall be harmed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said storms with mist the sky conceal snowy circles wheeling wild <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now like savage beast twill howl nikita nodded approvingly as he arranged the reins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man seeing vasili andreevich off brought a lantern into the passage to show him a light but it was blown out at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and even in the yard it was evident that the snowstorm had become more violent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps we may not get there after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides we have got ready our hosts horse their aged host also thought they ought not to go but he had already tried to persuade them to stay and had not been listened to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll get there all right and at least we shall get to bed in good time and without any fuss he thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew the road and the whole district so well and the lines about snowy circles wheeling wild described what was happening outside so aptly that it cheered him up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nikita did not wish to go at all but he had been accustomed not to have his own way and to serve others for so long that there was no one to hinder the departing travellers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vasili andreevich went over to his sledge found it with difficulty in the darkness climbed in and took the reins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its an awfu thing to be your lane at nicht wi siccan prodigies o darkness but mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned an gaed his ways oot o that room and lockit the door ahint him and step by step doon the stairs as heavy as leed and set doon the canle on the table at the stairfoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he couldnae pray he couldnae think he was dreepin wi caul swat an naething could he hear but the duntduntduntin o his ain heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he micht maybe have stood there an hour or maybe twa he minded sae little when a o a sudden he heard a laigh uncanny steer upstairs a foot gaed to an fro in the chamer whaur the corp was hingin syne the door was opened though he minded weel that he had lockit it an syne there was a step upon the landin an it seemed to him as if the corp was lookin ower the rail and doun upon him whaur he stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took up the canle again for he couldnae want the licht and as saftly as ever he could gaed straucht out o the manse an to the far end o the causeway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was aye pitmirk the flame o the canle when he set it on the grund brunt steedy and clear as in a room naething moved but the dule water seepin and sabbin doon the glen an yon unhaly footstep that cam ploddin doun the stairs inside the manse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kenned the foot over weel for it was janets and at ilka step that cam a wee thing nearer the cauld got deeper in his vitals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he commanded his soul to him that made an keepit him and o lord said he give me strength this night by this time the foot was comin through the passage for the door he could hear a hand skirt alang the wa as if the fearsome thing was feelin for its way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the saughs tossed an maned thegether a lang sigh cam ower the hills the flame o the canle was blawn aboot an there stood the corp of thrawn janet wi her grogram goun an her black mutch wi the heid aye upon the shouther an the girn still upon the face ot leevin ye wad hae said deid as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soulis weel kenned upon the threshold o the manse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a strange thing that the saul of man should be that thirled into his perishable body but the minister saw that an his heart didnae break <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she didnae stand there lang she began to move again an cam slowly towards mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a the life o his body a the strength o his speerit were glowerin frae his een <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed she was gaun to speak but wanted words an made a sign wi the left hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there cam a clap o wund like a cats fuff oot gaed the canle the saughs skrieghed like folk an mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soulis kenned that live or die this was the end ot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried i charge you by the power of god begone if you be dead to the grave if you be damned to an at that moment the lords ain hand out o the heevens struck the horror whaur it stood the auld deid desecrated corp o the witchwife sae lang keepit frae the grave and hirsled round by deils lowed up like a brunstane spunk and fell in ashes to the grund the thunder followed peal on dirling peal the rairing rain upon the back o that and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soulis lowped through the garden hedge and ran wi skelloch upon skelloch for the clachan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that same mornin john christie saw the black man pass the muckle cairn as it was chappin six before eicht he gaed by the change house at knockdow an no lang after sandy mlellan saw him gaun linkin doun the braes frae kilmackerlie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres little doubt but it was him that dwalled sae lang in janets body but he was awa at last and sinsyne the deil has never fashed us in baweary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was a sair dispensation for the minister lang lang he lay ravin in his bed and frae that hour to this he was the man ye ken the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said the doctor my part is done and i may say with some vanity well done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it remains only to get you out of this cold and poisonous city and to give you two months of a pure air and an easy conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the first i think i can help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it fells indeed rather oddly it was but the other day the padre came in from the country and as he and i are old friends although of contrary professions he applied to me in a matter of distress among some of his parishioners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a family but you are ignorant of spain and even the names of our grandees are hardly known to you suffice it then that they were once great people and are now fallen to the brink of destitution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing now belongs to them but the residencia and certain leagues of desert mountain in the greater part of which not even a goat could support life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the house is a fine old place and stands at a great height among the hills and most salubriously and i had no sooner heard my friends tale than i remembered you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him i had a wounded officer wounded in the good cause who was now able to make a change and i proposed that his friends should take you for a lodger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly the padres face grew dark as i had maliciously foreseen it would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was out of the question he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then let them starve said i for i have no sympathy with tatterdemalion pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon we separated not very content with one another but yesterday to my wonder the padre returned and made a submission the difficulty he said he had found upon enquiry to be less than he had feared or in other words these proud people had put their pride in their pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i closed with the offer and subject to your approval i have taken rooms for you in the residencia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air of these mountains will renew your blood and the quiet in which you will there live is worth all the doctor said i you have been throughout my good angel and your advice is a command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tell me if you please something of the i am coming to that replied my friend and indeed there is a difficulty in the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these beggars are as i have said of very high descent and swollen with the most baseless vanity they have lived for some generations in a growing isolation drawing away on either hand from the rich who had now become too high for them and from the poor whom they still regarded as too low and even today when poverty forces them to unfasten their door to a guest they cannot do so without a most ungracious stipulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are to remain they say a stranger they will give you attendance but i will not deny that i was piqued and perhaps the feeling strengthened my desire to go for i was confident that i could break down that barrier if i desired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing offensive in such a stipulation said i and i even sympathise with the it is true they have never seen you returned the doctor politely and if they knew you were the handsomest and the most pleasant man that ever came from england where i am told that handsome men are common but pleasant ones not so much so they would doubtless make you welcome with a better grace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but since you take the thing so well it matters not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mother a son and a daughter an old woman said to be halfwitted a country lout and a country girl who stands very high with her confessor and is therefore chuckled the physician most likely plain there is not much in and yet you say they are highborn i objected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well as to that i should distinguish returned the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh aunt hannah you dont know how good it seems to get into my music yes yes dear of course but aunt hannahs sentence ended in a vaguely troubled pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its only if it doesnt take too much timeand if billy flushed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no it wont take too much time i fancy andso far as bertram is concernedif what sister kate says is true aunt hannah hell be glad to have me occupy a little of my time with fiddlededee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said it night before last just before she went home with uncle william <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she declared that i seemed to forget entirely that bertram belonged to his art first before he belonged to me and that it was exactly as she had supposed it would bea perfect absurdity for bertram to think of marrying fiddlededee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ejaculated the irate aunt hannah even more sharply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you have too much good sense to mind what kate says yes i know sighed the girl but of course i can see some things for myself and i suppose i did makea little fuss about his going to new york the other night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i will own that ive had a real struggle with myself sometimes lately not to mindhis giving so much time to his portrait painting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of course both of those are very reprehensiblein an artists wife she finished a little tremulously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont think i should worry about that observed aunt hannah with grim positiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i dont mean to smiled billy wistfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only told you so youd understand that it was just as well if i did have something to take up my mindbesides bertram <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of course yes of course agreed aunt hannah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it seems actually almost providential that maryi mean mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arkwright is here to help me now that cyril is gone went on billy still a little wistfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aunt hannahs voice sounded as if she were trying to convince herself of something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seems just like one of the family to me almost as if he were reallyyour niece mary jane laughed billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy she hazarded he knows of course why of course he does aunt hannah everybody does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes yes of coursehe must subsided aunt hannah confusedly hoping that billy would not divine the hidden reason behind her question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was relieved when billys next words showed that she had not divined it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cant get here till five though but hes so interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes about as crazy over the thing as i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and its going to be fine aunt hannah when its done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she finished gayly as she tripped from the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> left to herself aunt hannah drew a long breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im glad she didnt suspect she was thinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe shed consider even the question disloyal to bertramdear child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of course maryaunt hannah corrected herself with cheeks aflamei mean mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arkwright does it was just here however that aunt hannah was mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not reached boston when the engagement was announced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew none of billys friends in town save the henshaw brothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not heard from calderwell since he came to boston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very evident intimacy of billy with the henshaw brothers he accepted as a matter of course knowing the history of their acquaintance and the fact that billy was mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to bertram being billys lover that idea had long ago been killed at birth by calderwells emphatic assertion that the artist would never care for any girlexcept to paint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since coming to boston arkwright had seen little of the two together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his work his friends and his general mode of life precluded that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because of all this therefore arkwright did not know which was a pityfor arkwright and for some others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> promptly at five oclock that afternoon arkwright rang billys doorbell and was admitted by rosa to the livingroom where billy was at the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy sprang to her feet with a joyous word of greeting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im so glad youve come she sighed happily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to hear the melody your pretty words have sung to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though maybe after all you wont like it you know she finished with arch wistfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as if i could help liking it smiled the man trying to keep from his voice the ecstatic delight that the touch of her hand had brought him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy shook her head and seated herself again at the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the words are lovely she declared sorting out two or three sheets of manuscript music from the quantity on the rack before her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theres one placethe rhythm you knowif you could change it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every stratum was aquiver with apprehension he declared and there was never any telling when the next grand upheaval would rock nor was bertram so far from being right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was indeed a chaos as none knew better than did bertrams wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sorry indeed were these days for billy and as if to make her cup of woe full to overflowing there were sister kates epistolary i told you so and aunt hannahs ever recurring lament if only billy you were a practical housekeeper yourself they wouldnt aunt hannah to be sure offered rosa and kate by letter offered adviceplenty of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but billy stung beyond all endurance and fairly radiating hurt pride and dogged determination disdained all assistance and with head held high declared she was getting along very well very well indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nora was a blueeyed black haired irish girl the sixth that the despairing billy had interviewed on that fateful morning when bertram had summoned her to his aid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during her reign the entire strata echoed to banged doors dropped china and slammed furniture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at her departure the henshaws possessions were less by four cups two saucers one plate one salad bowl two cut glass tumblers and a teapotthe latter williams choicest bit of lowestoft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was lowvoiced gentleeyed and a good cook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by that time the growing frequency of the disappearance of sundry small articles of value and convenience led to billys making a reluctant search of olgas roomand to olgas departure for the room was indeed a treasure house the treasure having gathered unto itself other treasures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> following olga came a period of what bertram called one night stands so frequently were the dramatis personae below stairs changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> christine knew only four words of english salt goodby no and yes and billy found need occasionally of using other words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennie could not even boil a potato properly much less cook a dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sarah colored was willing and pleasant but insufferably untidy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bridget was neatness itself but she had no conception of the value of time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her meals were always from thirty to sixty minutes late and halfcooked at that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vera sangwhen she wasnt whistlingand as she was generally off the key and always off the tune her almost frantic mistress dismissed her before twentyfour hours had passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was neat capable and obliging but it did not take her long to discover just how muchand how littleher mistress really knew of practical housekeeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she openly shirked her work when it pleased her so to do and demanded perquisites and privileges so insolently that even william asked billy one day whether mary ellen or billy herself were the mistress of the strata and bertram with mock humility inquired how soon mary ellen would be wanting the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy in weary despair submitted to this bullying for almost a week then in a sudden accession of outraged dignity that left mary ellen gasping with surprise she told the girl to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the maids came and the maids went and to billy each one seemed a little worse than the one before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nights were a torture of apprehension and the days an even greater torture of fulfilment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> noise confusion meals poorly cooked and worse served dust disorder and uncertainty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this was home billy told herself bitterly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder that bertram telephoned more and more frequently that he had met a friend and was dining in town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder that william pushed back his plate almost every meal with his food scarcely touched and then wandered about the house with that hungry homesick homeless look that nearly broke her heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aunt hannah and kate and the talk to young wives were right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not been fit to marry bertram <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not been fit to marry anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her honeymoon was not only waning but going into a total eclipse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had not bertram already declared that if she would tend to her husband billy clenched her small hands and set her round chin squarely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would tend to her husband and her home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she fancied she could learn to run that house and run it well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and forthwith she descended to the kitchen and told the then reigning tormentor that her wages would be paid until the end of the week but that her services would be immediately dispensed with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy was well aware now that housekeeping was a matter of more than muffins and date puffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could gauge in a measure the magnitude of the task to which she had set herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she did not falter and very systematically she set about making her plans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a good stout woman to come in twice a week for the heavier work she believed she could manage by herself very well until eliza could come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least she could serve more palatable meals than the most of those that had appeared lately and at least she could try to make a home that would not drive bertram to club dinners and uncle william to hungry wanderings from room to room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile all the time she could be learning and in due course she would reach that shining goal of housekeeping efficiency short of whichaccording to aunt hannah and the talk to young wivesno woman need hope for a waneless honeymoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so chaotic and erratic had been the household service and so quietly did billy slip into her new role that it was not until the second meal after the maids departure that the master of the house discovered what had happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as his wife rose to get some forgotten article he questioned too good to wait upon us is my lady now my lady is waiting on you smiled billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i see this lady is retorted bertram grimly but i mean our real lady in the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great scott billy how long are you going to billy tossed her head airily though she shook in her shoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes gone responded billy cheerfully resuming her seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> groaned bertram as william passed his plate with a smiling nod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well went on bertram resignedly she stayed longer than the last one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butyou served the dessert and at something in billys face a quick suspicion came into his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy you dont mean that yes she nodded brightly thats just what nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh come billy weve been all over this yes you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got to have it retorted billy still with that disarming airy cheerfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides twont be half so bad as you think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy as ive said before it takes yes i know it does dimpled billy and ive got mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes coming twice a week and more if i need her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dearie you dont know anything about how comfortable youre going to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill leave it to but uncle william had gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silently he had slipped from his chair and disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> uncle william it might be mentioned in passing had never quite forgotten aunt hannahs fateful call with its dire revelations concerning a certain unwanted superfluous thirdparty husbands brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remembering this there were times when he thought absence was both safest and best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but billy dear still argued bertram irritably how can you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well to tell the truth i was obliged to knock over a few of your tall lifeguards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seem to think youre a good thing and need looking after like jam in a cupboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you havent killed my guards said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is necessary continued edward that public men be protected from intrusion no matter how democratic they may be personally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would probably find it as difficult to approach the president of the united states as the king of england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you seem quite young to have mastered such wonderful secrets of nature continued the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i am replied rob modestly but these natural forces have really existed since the beginning of the world and some one was sure to discover them in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are an american i suppose said the minister coming close to rob and staring him in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guessed right the first time answered the boy and drawing his character marking spectacles from his pocket he put them on and stared at the minister in turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the mans forehead appeared the letter e <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your majesty said rob i have here another queer invention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you please wear these spectacles for a few moments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are called character markers continued the boy because the lenses catch and concentrate the character vibrations radiating from every human individual and reflect the true character of the person upon his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a letter g appears you may be sure his disposition is good if his forehead is marked with an e his character is evil and you must beware of treachery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king saw the e plainly marked upon his ministers forehead but he said nothing except thank you and returned the spectacles to rob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the minister who from the first had been ill at ease now became positively angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a trick and meant to deceive you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not accuse you answered the king sternly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he added i wish to be alone with this young gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the minister left the room with an anxious face and hanging head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said rob lets look over the record of the past day and see if that fellow has been up to any mischief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned the cylinder of the record to england and slowly the events of the last twentyfour hours were reproduced one after the other upon the polished plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the record pictured a small room in which were seated three gentlemen engaged in earnest conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those men said the king in a low voice while he pointed out the other two are my avowed enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is proof that your wonderful spectacles indicated my ministers character with perfect truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am grateful to you for thus putting me upon my guard for i have trusted the man fully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got heaps of soft places in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid of being drowned for one thing or of getting my eyes shot out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iverys afraid of bombs at any rate hes afraid of bombs in a big city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i once read a book which talked about a thing called agoraphobia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps its that now if we know that weak spot it helps us in our work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some places he wont go to and there are some things he cant do yees said macgillivray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps its not what youd call a theres another chink in his armour i went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres one person in the world he can never practise his transformations on and thats me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall always know him again though he appeared as sir douglas haig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant explain why but ive got a feel in my bones about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt recognize him before for i thought he was dead and the nerve in my brain which should have been looking for him wasnt working <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im on my guard now and that nerves functioning at full power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever and wherever and howsoever we meet again on the face of the earth it will be dr that is better said macgillivray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we have any luck hannay mary got up from the piano and resumed her old perch on the arm of sir walters chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres another blind spot which you havent mentioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a cool evening but i noticed that her cheeks had suddenly flushed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last week mr ivery asked me to marry him she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter twelve i returned to france on september and took over my old brigade on the th of the same month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were shoved in at the polygon wood on the th and after four days got so badly mauled that we were brought out to refit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on october very much to my surprise i was given command of a division and was on the fringes of the ypres fighting during the first days of november <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that front we were hurried down to cambrai in support but came in only for the last backwash of that singular battle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we held a bit of the st quentin sector till just before christmas when we had a spell of rest in billets which endured so far as i was concerned till the beginning of january when i was sent off on the errand which i shall presently relate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a brief summary of my military record in the latter part of i am not going to enlarge on the fighting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> except for the days of the polygon wood it was neither very severe nor very distinguished and you will find it in the history books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i have to tell of here is my own personal quest for all the time i was living with my mind turned two ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morasses of the haanebeek flats in the slimy support lines at zonnebeke in the tortured uplands about flesquieres and in many other odd places i kept worrying at my private conundrum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at night i would lie awake thinking of it and many a toss i took into shellholes and many a time i stepped off the duckboards because my eyes were on a different landscape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody ever chewed a few wretched clues into such a pulp as i did during those bleak months in flanders and picardy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i had an instinct that the thing was desperately grave graver even than the battle before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> russia had gone headlong to the devil italy had taken it between the eyes and was still dizzy and our own prospects were none too bright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boche was getting uppish and with some cause and i foresaw a rocky time ahead till america could line up with us in the field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the chance for the wild birds and i used to wake in a sweat to think what devilry ivery might be engineering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe i did my proper job reasonably well but i put in my most savage thinking over the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember how i used to go over every hour of every day from that june night in the cotswolds till my last meeting with bullivant in london trying to find a new bearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should probably have got brainfever if i hadnt had to spend most of my days and nights fighting a stiffish battle with a very watchful hun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that kept my mind balanced and i dare say it gave an edge to it for during those months i was lucky enough to hit on a better scent than bullivant and macgillivray and blenkiron pulling a thousand wires in their london offices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will set down in order of time the various incidents in this private quest of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first was my meeting with geordie hamilton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened just after i rejoined the brigade when i went down to have a look at our scots fusilier battalion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old brigade had been roughly handled on st july and had had to get heavy drafts to come anywhere near strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fusiliers especially were almost a new lot formed by joining our remnants to the remains of a battalion in another division and bringing about a dozen officers from the training unit at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i inspected the men and my eyes caught sight of a familiar face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked his name and the colonel got it from the sergeantmajor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i wanted a new batman and i resolved then and there to have my old antagonist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that afternoon he reported to me at brigade headquarters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i looked at that solid bandylegged figure standing as stiff to attention as a tobacconists sign his ugly face hewn out of brown oak his honest sullen mouth and his blue eyes staring into vacancy i knew i had got the man i wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he moved his eyes a fraction in a respectful glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you remember the hall in newmilns street and the meeting there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had a fight with a he made no answer but his colour deepened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a fortnight later in a publichouse in muirtown you saw the i could see his mouth set for visions of the penalties laid down by the kings regulations for striking an officer must have crossed his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sirr i did not ken i was hittin an officer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you did perfectly right and if the war was over and we were both free men i would give you a chance of knocking me down here and now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you saw me last i was serving my country though you didnt know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were serving together now and you must get your revenge out of the boche <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to make you my servant for you and i have a this time he looked me full in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his troubled eye appraised me and was satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im proud to be servant to ye sirr he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then out of his chest came a strangled chuckle and he forgot his discipline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he recovered himself promptly saluted and marched off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second episode befell during our brief rest after the polygon wood when i had ridden down the line one afternoon to see a friend in the heavy artillery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was returning in the drizzle of evening clanking along the greasy path between the sad poplars when i struck a labour company repairing the ravages of a boche strafe that morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wasnt very certain of my road and asked one of the workers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he straightened himself and saluted and i saw beneath a disreputable cap the features of the man who had been with me in the coolin crevice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spoke a word to his sergeant who fell him out and he walked a bit of the way with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had dismounted and was walking beside him and i noticed that his lean face had lost its pallor and that his eyes were less hot than they used to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you seem to thrive on it i said for i did not know what to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wake must have gone through some violent cyclones of feeling before it came to this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw what i was thinking and laughed in his sharp ironical way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i came to the conclusion that since the fates had made me a government servant i might as well do my work somewhere less cushioned than a chair in the home office oh no it wasnt a matter of principle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one kind of works as good as another and im a better clerk than a navvy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with me it was selfindulgence i looked at him mud to the waist and his hands all blistered and cut with unaccustomed labour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could realize what his associates must mean to him and how he would relish the rough tonguing of noncoms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why on earth didnt you go into an otc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre easy you mistake my case he said bitterly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i experienced no sudden conviction about the justice of the war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a noncombatant and i wanted a change of civilian work no it wasnt any idiotic tribunal sent me here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came of its a rough job for a man like you i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not so rough as the fellows get in the trenches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i watched a battalion marching back today and they looked like ghosts who had been years in muddy graves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white faces and dazed eyes and leaden feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like it best when the weathers foul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> much of that sort of now and then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant say i liked it at the time but i like to look back on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they think im a prig which i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doesnt amuse me to talk about beer and women or listen to a gramophone or grouse about my last meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i get a seat in a corner of a ymca <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was up at keble in my time and as one of my colleagues puts it wants to be too bloody helpful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soldiering in the salient isnt the softest of jobs but i dont believe its as tough as yours is for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dyou know wake i wish i had you in my brigade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trained or untrained he laughed with a trifle less acidity than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent the courage and besides theres my jolly old principles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the same id like to be near you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose you discovered that woman to be utterly unworthy of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose you were quite convinced that it was a disgrace to you to waste another thought on her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose the bare idea of ever marrying such a person made your face burn only with thinking of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and suppose in spite of all thatyou couldnt tear her from your heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose the feeling she had roused in you in the time when you believed in her was not a feeling to be hidden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose the love this wretch had inspired in you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how can i find words to say it in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can i make a man understand that a feeling which horrifies me at myself can be a feeling that fascinates me at the same time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the breath of my life godfrey and its the poison that kills meboth in one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must be out of my mind to talk as i am talking now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mustnt leave meyou mustnt carry away a wrong impression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must say what is to be said in my own defence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he doesnt know he never will know what i have told you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will never see him i dont care what happensi will never never never see him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you doctor enough godfrey to tell me why i feel as if i was stifling for want of breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there a form of hysterics that bursts into words instead of tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will get over any trouble i have caused you easily enough now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have dropped to my right place in your estimation havent i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned round on a sudden and beat her hands wildly on the back of the ottoman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her head dropped on the cushions and she burst out crying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before i had time to feel shocked at this i was horrorstruck by an entirely unexpected proceeding on the part of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will it be credited that he fell on his knees at her feet.?on both knees i solemnly declare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may modesty mention that he put his arms round her next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and may reluctant admiration acknowledge that he electrified her with two words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he did it with one of the bursts which have made his fame as a public speaker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat either quite thunderstruck or quite fascinatedi dont know whichwithout even making an effort to put his arms back where his arms ought to have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for me my sense of propriety was completely bewildered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was so painfully uncertain whether it was my first duty to close my eyes or to stop my ears that i did neither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i attribute my being still able to hold the curtain in the right position for looking and listening entirely to suppressed hysterics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in suppressed hysterics it is admitted even by the doctors that one must hold something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he said with all the fascination of his evangelical voice and manner you are a noble creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a woman who can speak the truth for the truths own sakea woman who will sacrifice her pride rather than sacrifice an honest man who loves heris the most priceless of all treasures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when such a woman marries if her husband only wins her esteem and regard he wins enough to ennoble his whole life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have spoken dearest of your place in my estimation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge what that place iswhen i implore you on my knees to let the cure of your poor wounded heart be my care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you honour me will you bless me by being my wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time i should certainly have decided on stopping my ears if rachel had not encouraged me to keep them open by answering him in the first sensible words i had ever heard fall from her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never spoke more reasonably dearestin your interests as well as in mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is your happiness to be sacrificed to a man who has never known how you feel towards him and whom you are resolved never to see again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it not your duty to yourself to forget this illfated attachment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and is forgetfulness to be found in the life you are leading now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have tried that life and you are wearying of it already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surround yourself with nobler interests than the wretched interests of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a heart that loves and honours you a home whose peaceful claims and happy duties win gently on you day by day try the consolation rachel which is to be found there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont ask for your lovei will be content with your affection and regard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let the rest be left confidently left to your husbands devotion and to time that heals even wounds as deep as yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh what a bringingup she must have had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how differently i should have acted in her place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont tempt me godfrey she said i am wretched enough and reckless enough as it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont tempt me to be more wretched and more wreckless still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after what you have just said to me i should be insensible indeed if i didnt respect and admire you as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know many wives my dear rachel who respect and admire their husbands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet they and their husbands get on very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many brides go to the altar with hearts that would bear inspection by the men who take them there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet it doesnt end unhappily somehow or other the nuptial establishment jogs on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth is that women try marriage as a refuge far more numerously than they are willing to admit and what is more they find that marriage has justified their confidence in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at your age and with your attractions is it possible for you to sentence yourself to a single life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trust my knowledge of the world nothing is less possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may marry some other man some years hence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or you may marry the man dearest who is now at your feet and who prizes your respect and admiration above the love of any other woman on the face of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are putting something into my head which i never thought of before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are tempting me with a new prospect when all my other prospects are closed before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you again i am miserable enough and desperate enough if you say another word to marry you on your own terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont even rise from my knees till you have said yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i say yes you will repent and i shall repent when it is too late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall both bless the day darling when i pressed and when you yielded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you feel as confidently as you speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i speak from what i have seen in my own family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me what you think of our household at frizinghall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do my father and mother live unhappily together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far from itso far as i can see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when my mother was a girl rachel it is no secret in the family she had loved as you loveshe had given her heart to a man who was unworthy of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she married my father respecting him admiring him but nothing more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there no encouragement in it for you see betteredges narrative chapter viii <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wont ask me for more than i can give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only ask you to give me yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had another bursta burst of unholy rapture this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew her nearer and nearer to him till her face touched his and thenno <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i really cannot prevail upon myself to carry this shocking disclosure any farther <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me only say that i tried to close my eyes before it happened and that i was just one moment too late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had calculated you see on her resisting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to every rightfeeling person of my own sex volumes could say no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even my innocence in such matters began to see its way to the end of the interview now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they understood each other so thoroughly by this time that i fully expected to see them walk off together arm in arm to be married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> godfreys next words to be one more trifling formality which it was necessary to observe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seated himselfunforbidden this time on the ottoman by her side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let my mother hear nothing from either of us until she is better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish it to be kept a secret for the present godfrey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have been here alone together quite long enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rose and in rising looked for the first time towards the little room in which my martyrdom was going on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room is close enough as it is without keeping the air out of it in that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the moment when she laid her hand on them at the moment when the discovery of me appeared to be quite inevitable the voice of the freshcoloured young footman on the stairs suddenly suspended any further proceedings on her side or on mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was unmistakably the voice of a man in great alarm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called out where are you miss rachel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sprang back from the curtains and ran to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lady has fainted and we cant bring her to again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment more i was alone and free to go downstairs in my turn quite unobserved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> godfrey passed me in the hall hurrying out to fetch the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found rachel on her knees by the sofa with her mothers head on her bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one look at my aunts face knowing what i knew was enough to warn me of the dreadful truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i kept my thoughts to myself till the doctor came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began by sending rachel out of the roomand then he told the rest of us that lady verinder was no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> serious persons in search of proofs of hardened scepticism may be interested in hearing that he showed no signs of remorse when he looked at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at a later hour i peeped into the breakfastroom and the library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt had died without opening one of the letters which i had addressed to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was so shocked at this that it never occurred to me until some days afterwards that she had also died without giving me my little legacy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> franklin blake and in sending him the fifth chapter of her humble narrative begs to say that she feels quite unequal to enlarge as she could wish on an event so awful under the circumstances as lady verinders death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has therefore attached to her own manuscripts copious extracts from precious publications in her possession all bearing on this terrible subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and may those extracts miss clack fervently hopes sound as the blast of a trumpet in the ears of her respected kinsman mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> franklin blake presents his compliments to miss clack and begs to thank her for the fifth chapter of her narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in returning the extracts sent with it he will refrain from mentioning any personal objection which he may entertain to this species of literature and will merely say that the proposed additions to the manuscript are not necessary to the fulfilment of the purpose that he has in view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss clack begs to acknowledge the return of her extracts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> franklin blake that she is a christian and that it is therefore quite impossible for him to offend her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> persists in feeling the deepest interest in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blake and pledges herself on the first occasion when sickness may lay him low to offer him the use of her extracts for the second time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meanwhile she would be glad to know before beginning the final chapters of her narrative whether she may be permitted to make her humble contribution complete by availing herself of the light which later discoveries have thrown on the mystery of the moonstone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> franklin blake is sorry to disappoint miss clack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can only repeat the instructions which he had the honour of giving her when she began her narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is requested to limit herself to her own individual experience of persons and events as recorded in her diary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later discoveries she will be good enough to leave to the pens of those persons who can write in the capacity of actual witnesses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss clack is extremely sorry to trouble mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her extracts have been returned and the expression of her matured views on the subject of the moonstone has been forbidden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss clack is painfully conscious that she ought in the worldly phrase to feel herself put down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has learnt perseverance in the school of adversity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her object in writing is to know whether mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blake who prohibits everything else prohibits the appearance of the present correspondence in miss clacks narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some explanation of the position in which mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blakes interference has placed her as an authoress seems due on the ground of common justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and miss clack on her side is most anxious that her letters should be produced to speak for themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> franklin blake agrees to miss clacks proposal on the understanding that she will kindly consider this intimation of his consent as closing the correspondence between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss clack feels it an act of christian duty before the correspondence closes to inform mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> franklin blake that his last letterevidently intended to offend her has not succeeded in accomplishing the object of the writer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blake to retire to the privacy of his own room and to consider with himself whether the training which can thus elevate a poor weak woman above the reach of insult be not worthy of greater admiration than he is now disposed to feel for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on being favoured with an intimation to that effect miss c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> solemnly pledges herself to send back the complete series of her extracts to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foregoing correspondence will sufficiently explain why no choice is left to me but to pass over lady verinders death with the simple announcement of the fact which ends my fifth chapter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keeping myself for the future strictly within the limits of my own personal experience i have next to relate that a month elapsed from the time of my aunts decease before rachel verinder and i met again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that meeting was the occasion of my spending a few days under the same roof with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the course of my visit something happened relative to her marriageengagement with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> godfrey ablewhite which is important enough to require special notice in these pages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when this last of many painful family circumstances has been disclosed my task will be completed for i shall then have told all that i know as an actual and most unwilling witness of events <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunts remains were removed from london and were buried in the little cemetery attached to the church in her own park <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was invited to the funeral with the rest of the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was impossible with my religious views to rouse myself in a few days only from the shock which this death had caused me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was informed moreover that the rector of frizinghall was to read the service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having myself in past times seen this clerical castaway making one of the players at lady verinders whisttable i doubt even if i had been fit to travel whether i should have felt justified in attending the ceremony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lady verinders death left her daughter under the care of her brotherinlaw mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was appointed guardian by the will until his niece married or came of age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> godfrey informed his father i suppose of the new relation in which he stood towards rachel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate in ten days from my aunts death the secret of the marriageengagement was no secret at all within the circle of the family and the grand question for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ablewhite senior another confirmed castaway!was how to make himself and his authority most agreeable to the wealthy young lady who was going to marry his son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rachel gave him some trouble at the outset about the choice of a place in which she could be prevailed upon to reside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house in montagu square was associated with the calamity of her mothers death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house in yorkshire was associated with the scandalous affair of the lost moonstone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her guardians own residence at frizinghall was open to neither of these objections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but rachels presence in it after her recent bereavement operated as a check on the gaieties of her cousins the miss ablewhitesand she herself requested that her visit might be deferred to a more favourable opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it ended in a proposal emanating from old mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ablewhite to try a furnished house at brighton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife an invalid daughter and rachel were to inhabit it together and were to expect him to join them later in the season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would see no society but a few old friends and they would have his son godfrey travelling backwards and forwards by the london train always at their disposal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i describe this aimless flitting about from one place of residence to anotherthis insatiate restlessness of body and appalling stagnation of soulmerely with the view to arriving at results <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the event which under providence proved to be the means of bringing rachel verinder and myself together again was no other than the hiring of the house at brighton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt ablewhite is a large silent faircomplexioned woman with one noteworthy point in her character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the hour of her birth she has never been known to do anything for herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has gone through life accepting everybodys help and adopting everybodys opinions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a more hopeless person in a spiritual point of view i have never met withthere is absolutely in this perplexing case no obstructive material to work upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aunt ablewhite would listen to the grand lama of thibet exactly as she listens to me and would reflect his views quite as readily as she reflects mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she found the furnished house at brighton by stopping at an hotel in london composing herself on a sofa and sending for her son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she discovered the necessary servants by breakfasting in bed one morning still at the hotel and giving her maid a holiday on condition that the girl would begin enjoying herself by fetching miss clack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found her placidly fanning herself in her dressinggown at eleven oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are so clever please get them for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the churchbells were going for a weekday service they suggested a word of affectionate remonstrance on my part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is the passage from time to eternity to be made in this manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt answered ill put on my gown drusilla if you will be kind enough to help me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have done wonders with murderessesi have never advanced an inch with aunt ablewhite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where is the list i asked of the servants whom you require <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt shook her head she hadnt even energy enough to keep the list <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rachel has got it dear she said in the next room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went into the next room and so saw rachel again for the first time since we had parted in montagu square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked pitiably small and thin in her deep mourning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ole he was glad to get down out of the sun and chaff it gets down your neck and sticks to you something awful when its hot like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so ole jumped down and crawled under one of the wagons for shade and the tramp got on the machine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cut bands all right for a few minutes and then mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harling he waved his hand to me and jumped headfirst right into the threshing machine after the wheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i begun to scream and the men run to stop the horses but the belt had sucked him down and by the time they got her stopped he was all beat and cut to pieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was wedged in so tight it was a hard job to get him out was he clear dead tony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop crying nina or ill always send you upstairs when antonia tells us about the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hadnt been seen nowhere except in a little town they call conway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to get beer there but there wasnt any saloon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe he came in on a freight but the brakeman hadnt seen him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they couldnt find no letters nor nothing on him nothing but an old penknife in his pocket and the wishbone of a chicken wrapped up in a piece some poetry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the old oaken bucket cut out of a newspaper and nearly worn out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ole iverson now wasnt that strange miss frances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would anybody want to kill themselves in summer for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe ill go home and help you thresh next summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a basic harmony between antonia and her mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had strong independent natures both of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they knew what they liked and were not always trying to imitate other people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they loved children and animals and music and rough play and digging in the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they liked to prepare rich hearty food and to see people eat it to make up soft white beds and to see youngsters asleep in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ridiculed conceited people and were quick to help unfortunate ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deep down in each of them there was a kind of hearty joviality a relish of life not overdelicate but very invigorating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never tried to define it but i was distinctly conscious of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not imagine antonias living for a week in any other house in black hawk than the harlings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> winter lies too long in country towns hangs on until it is stale and shabby old and sullen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the farm the weather was the great fact and mens affairs went on underneath it as the streams creep under the ice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in black hawk the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pinched frozen down to the bare stalk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through january and february i went to the river with the harlings on clear nights and we skated up to the big island and made bonfires on the frozen sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but by march the ice was rough and choppy and the snow on the river bluffs was grey and mournfullooking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was tired of school tired of winter clothes of the rutted streets of the dirty drifts and the piles of cinders that had lain in the yards so long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was only one break in the dreary monotony of that month when blind darnault the negro pianist came to town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave a concert at the opera house on monday night and he and his manager spent saturday and sunday at our comfortable hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told antonia she had better go to see tiny that saturday evening as there would certainly be music at the boys home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> saturday night after supper i ran downtown to the hotel and slipped quietly into the parlour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chairs and sofas were already occupied and the air smelled pleasantly of cigar smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the parlour had once been two rooms and the floor was swaybacked where the partition had been cut away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind from without made waves in the long carpet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a coal stove glowed at either end of the room and the grand piano in the middle stood open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an atmosphere of unusual freedom about the house that night for mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gardener had gone to omaha for a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> johnnie had been having drinks with the guests until he was rather absentminded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gardener who ran the business and looked after everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her husband stood at the desk and welcomed incoming travellers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a popular fellow but no manager <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gardener was admittedly the bestdressed woman in black hawk drove the best horse and had a smart trap and a little whiteandgold sleigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed indifferent to her possessions was not half so solicitous about them as her friends were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was tall dark severe with something indianlike in the rigid immobility of her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her manner was cold and she talked little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guests felt that they were receiving not conferring a favour when they stayed at her house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the smartest travelling men were flattered when mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gardener stopped to chat with them for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the patrons of the hotel were divided into two classes those who had seen mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i stole into the parlour anson kirkpatrick marshall fields man was at the piano playing airs from a musical comedy then running in chicago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a dapper little irishman very vain homely as a monkey with friends everywhere and a sweetheart in every port like a sailor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not know all the men who were sitting about but i recognized a furniture salesman from kansas city a drug man and willy oreilly who travelled for a jewellery house and sold musical instruments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the talk was all about good and bad hotels actors and actresses and musical prodigies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gardener had gone to omaha to hear booth and barrett who were to play there next week and that mary anderson was having a great success in a winters tale in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door from the office opened and johnnie gardener came in directing blind darnaulthe would never consent to be led <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a heavy bulky mulatto on short legs and he came tapping the floor in front of him with his goldheaded cane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his yellow face was lifted in the light with a show of white teeth all grinning and his shrunken papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the soft amiable negro voice like those i remembered from early childhood with the note of docile subservience in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had the negro head too almost no head at all nothing behind the ears but folds of neck under closeclipped wool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have been repulsive if his face had not been so kindly and happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the happiest face i had seen since i left virginia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt his way directly to the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment he sat down i noticed the nervous infirmity of which mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he was sitting or standing still he swayed back and forth incessantly like a rocking toy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the piano he swayed in time to the music and when he was not playing his body kept up this motion like an empty mill grinding on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found the pedals and tried them ran his yellow hands up and down the keys a few times tinkling off scales then turned to the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing happened to her since the last time i was here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gardener she always has this piano tuned up before i come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now gentlemen i expect youve all got grand voices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with miss tilney from the intercourse of the day she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before instead of seeing henry tilney to greater advantage than ever in the ease of a family party he had never said so little nor been so little agreeable and in spite of their fathers great civilities to herin spite of his thanks invitations and complimentsit had been a release to get away from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it puzzled her to account for all this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he was perfectly agreeable and goodnatured and altogether a very charming man did not admit of a doubt for he was tall and handsome and henrys father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not be accountable for his childrens want of spirits or for her want of enjoyment in his company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the former she hoped at last might have been accidental and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isabella on hearing the particulars of the visit gave a different explanation it was all pride pride insufferable haughtiness and pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had long suspected the family to be very high and this made it certain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such insolence of behaviour as miss tilneys she had never heard of in her life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to behave to her guest with such superciliousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine indeed he is unworthy of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not suppose he ever thinks of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is exactly what i say he never thinks of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how different to your brother and to mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i really believe john has the most constant heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as for general tilney i assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know no harm of him i do not suspect him of pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe he is a very gentlemanlike man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john thinks very well of him and johns judgment well i shall see how they behave to me this evening we shall meet them at the rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay since you make such a point of it i can refuse you nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as for dancing do not mention it i beg that is quite out of the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say but i shall cut him very short <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten to one but he guesses the reason and that is exactly what i want to avoid so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isabellas opinion of the tilneys did not influence her friend she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the evening rewarded her confidence she was met by one with the same kindness and by the other with the same attention as heretofore miss tilney took pains to be near her having heard the day before in milsom street that their elder brother captain tilney was expected almost every hour she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionablelooking handsome young man whom she had never seen before and who now evidently belonged to their party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with great admiration and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother though in her eyes his air was more assuming and his countenance less prepossessing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior for within her hearing he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself but even laughed openly at henry for finding it possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the latter circumstance it may be presumed that whatever might be our heroines opinion of him his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind not likely to produce animosities between the brothers nor persecutions to the lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cannot be the instigator of the three villains in horsemens greatcoats by whom she will hereafter be forced into a travelingchaise and four which will drive off with incredible speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> catherine meanwhile undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil or of any evil at all except that of having but a short set to dance down enjoyed her usual happiness with henry tilney listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said and in finding him irresistible at the end of the first dance captain tilney came towards them again and much to catherines dissatisfaction pulled his brother away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they retired whispering together and though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm and lay it down as fact that captain tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her which he now hastened to communicate to his brother in the hope of separating them forever she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her suspense was of full five minutes duration and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour when they both returned and an explanation was given by henrys requesting to know if she thought her friend miss thorpe would have any objection to dancing as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> catherine without hesitation replied that she was very sure miss thorpe did not mean to dance at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cruel reply was passed on to the other and he your brother will not mind it i know said she because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very goodnatured in him to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry smiled and said how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other peoples actions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a persons feelings age situation and probable habits of life consideredbut how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring no no it shall not do either i am not afraid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his first movement was to return to the house his second as he remembered miss vandeleurs advice to continue his flight with greater expedition than before and he was in the act of turning to put his thought in action when the dictator bareheaded bawling aloud his white hair blowing about his head shot past him like a ball out of the cannons mouth and went careering down the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was a close shave thought francis to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he wants with me and why he should be so disturbed i cannot think but he is plainly not good company for the moment and i cannot do better than follow miss vandeleurs advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so saying he turned to retrace his steps thinking to double and descend by the rue lepic itself while his pursuer should continue to follow after him on the other line of street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plan was ill devised as a matter of fact he should have taken his seat in the nearest cafe and waited there until the first heat of the pursuit was over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but besides that francis had no experience and little natural aptitude for the small war of private life he was so unconscious of any evil on his part that he saw nothing to fear beyond a disagreeable interview <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to disagreeable interviews he felt he had already served his apprenticeship that evening nor could he suppose that miss vandeleur had left anything unsaid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed the young man was sore both in body and mind the one was all bruised the other was full of smarting arrows and he owned to himself that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vandeleur was master of a very deadly tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought of his bruises reminded him that he had not only come without a hat but that his clothes had considerably suffered in his descent through the chestnut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the first magazine he purchased a cheap wideawake and had the disorder of his toilet summarily repaired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the keepsake still rolled in the handkerchief he thrust in the meanwhile into his trousers pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not many steps beyond the shop he was conscious of a sudden shock a hand upon his throat an infuriated face close to his own and an open mouth bawling curses in his ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dictator having found no trace of his quarry was returning by the other way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis was a stalwart young fellow but he was no match for his adversary whether in strength or skill and after a few ineffectual struggles he resigned himself entirely to his captor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will talk of that at home returned the dictator grimly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he continued to march the young man up hill in the direction of the house with the green blinds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but francis although he no longer struggled was only waiting an opportunity to make a bold push for freedom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a sudden jerk he left the collar of his coat in the hands of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vandeleur and once more made off at his best speed in the direction of the boulevards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the dictator was the stronger francis in the top of his youth was the more fleet of foot and he had soon effected his escape among the crowds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> relieved for a moment but with a growing sentiment of alarm and wonder in his mind be walked briskly until he debauched upon the place de lopera lit up like day with electric lamps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this at least thought he should satisfy miss vandeleur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and turning to his right along the boulevards he entered the cafe americain and ordered some beer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was both late and early for the majority of the frequenters of the establishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only two or three persons all men were dotted here and there at separate tables in the hall and francis was too much occupied by his own thoughts to observe their presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the object wrapped in it proved to be a morocco case clasped and ornamented in gilt which opened by means of a spring and disclosed to the horrified young man a diamond of monstrous bigness and extraordinary brilliancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the circumstance was so inexplicable the value of the stone was plainly so enormous that francis sat staring into the open casket without movement without conscious thought like a man stricken suddenly with idiocy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hand was laid upon his shoulder lightly but firmly and a quiet voice which yet had in it the ring of command uttered these words close the casket and compose your face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking up he beheld a man still young of an urbane and tranquil presence and dressed with rich simplicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this personage had risen from a neighbouring table and bringing his glass with him had taken a seat beside francis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> close the casket repeated the stranger and put it quietly back into your pocket where i feel persuaded it should never have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> try if you please to throw off your bewildered air and act as though i were one of your acquaintances whom you had met by chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fear sir you must be an amateur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the stranger pronounced these last words with a smile of peculiar meaning leaned back in his seat and enjoyed a deep inhalation of tobacco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gods sake said francis tell me who you are and what this means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i should obey your most unusual suggestions i am sure i know not but the truth is i have fallen this evening into so many perplexing adventures and all i meet conduct themselves so strangely that i think i must either have gone mad or wandered into another planet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your face inspires me with confidence you seem wise good and experienced tell me for heavens sake why you accost me in so odd a fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have the first hand and you must begin by telling me how the rajahs diamond is in your possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would not speak so loud if i were you returned the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but most certainly you have the rajahs diamond in your pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen and handled it a score of times in sir thomas vandeleurs collection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not aware the general had any family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am illegitimate sir replied francis with a flush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a respectful bow as of a man silently apologising to his equal and francis felt relieved and comforted he scarce knew why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the society of this person did him good he seemed to touch firm ground a strong feeling of respect grew up in his bosom and mechanically he removed his wideawake as though in the presence of a superior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i perceive said the stranger that your adventures have not all been peaceful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your collar is torn your face is scratched you have a cut upon your temple you will perhaps pardon my curiosity when i ask you to explain how you came by these injuries and how you happen to have stolen property to an enormous value in your pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you refer to the diamond it was given to me not an hour ago by miss vandeleur in the rue lepic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vandeleur take an article from the breast of his drugged visitor and that article he was now persuaded was a morocco case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know not who you are but i believe you to be worthy of confidence and helpful i find myself in strange waters i must have counsel and support and since you invite me i shall tell you all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he briefly recounted his experiences since the day when he was summoned from the bank by his lawyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yours is indeed a remarkable history said the stranger after the young man had made an end of his narrative and your position is full of difficulty and peril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many would counsel you to seek out your father and give the diamond to him but i have other views <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you ask the manager to speak with me a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he and francis observed once more both in his tone and manner the evidence of a habit of command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the waiter withdrew and returned in a moment with manager who bowed with obsequious respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what said he can i do to serve you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have the goodness replied the stranger indicating francis to tell this gentleman my name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have the honour sir said the functionary addressing young scrymgeour to occupy the same table with his highness prince florizel of bohemia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis rose with precipitation and made a grateful reverence to the prince who bade him resume his seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thank you said florizel once more addressing the functionary i am sorry to have deranged you for so small a matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he dismissed him with a movement of his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now added the prince turning to francis give me the diamond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without a word the casket was handed over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have done right said florizel your sentiments have properly inspired you and you will live to be grateful for the misfortunes of tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scrymgeour may fall into a thousand perplexities but if his heart be upright and his intelligence unclouded he will issue from them all without dishonour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let your mind be at rest your affairs are in my hand and with the aid of heaven i am strong enough to bring them to a good end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> follow me if you please to my carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be your wife and live in paris would be heaven to me but i would rather live with you in a hermitage here than not be yours at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is gain to me either way and very great gain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes the sand has nearly slipped away i see and the eclipse is creeping on more and more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop till the hour has run itself out then i will not press you any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will go home and sleep well i keep sighing in my sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot recollect a clear dream of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see your face in every scene of my dreams and hear your voice in every sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet once i remember i saw an officer of the hussars ride down the street at budmouth and though he was a total stranger and never spoke to me i loved him till i thought i should really die of love but i didnt die and at last i left off caring for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how terrible it would be if a time should come when i could not love you my clym <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we see such a time at hand we will say i have outlived my faith and purpose and die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there the hour has expirednow let us walk on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hand in hand they went along the path towards mistover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were near the house he said it is too late for me to see your grandfather tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think he will object to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am so accustomed to be my own mistress that it did not occur to me that we should have to ask him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they lingeringly separated and clym descended towards bloomsend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as he walked further and further from the charmed atmosphere of his olympian girl his face grew sad with a new sort of sadness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a perception of the dilemma in which his love had placed him came back in full force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of eustacias apparent willingness to wait through the period of an unpromising engagement till he should be established in his new pursuit he could not but perceive at moments that she loved him rather as a visitant from a gay world to which she rightly belonged than as a man with a purpose opposed to that recent past of his which so interested her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it meant that though she made no conditions as to his return to the french capital this was what she secretly longed for in the event of marriage and it robbed him of many an otherwise pleasant hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along with that came the widening breach between himself and his mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever any little occurrence had brought into more prominence than usual the disappointment that he was causing her it had sent him on lone and moody walks or he was kept awake a great part of the night by the turmoil of spirit which such a recognition created <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yeobright could only have been led to see what a sound and worthy purpose this purpose of his was and how little it was being affected by his devotions to eustacia how differently would she regard him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus as his sight grew accustomed to the first blinding halo kindled about him by love and beauty yeobright began to perceive what a strait he was in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes he wished that he had never known eustacia immediately to retract the wish as brutal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three antagonistic growths had to be kept alive his mothers trust in him his plan for becoming a teacher and eustacias happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his fervid nature could not afford to relinquish one of these though two of the three were as many as he could hope to preserve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though his love was as chaste as that of petrarch for his laura it had made fetters of what previously was only a difficulty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a position which was not too simple when he stood wholehearted had become indescribably complicated by the addition of eustacia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just when his mother was beginning to tolerate one scheme he had introduced another still bitterer than the first when yeobright was not with eustacia he was sitting slavishly over his books when he was not reading he was meeting her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one afternoon his mother came home from a morning visit to thomasin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could see from a disturbance in the lines i have been told an incomprehensible thing she said mournfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain has let out at the woman that you and eustacia vye are engaged to be married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it may not be yet for a very long time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should hardly think it would be yet for a very long time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will take her to paris i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what will you do with a wife then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep a school in budmouth as i have told you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what possible chance is there for such as you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but with my system of education which is as new as it is true i shall do a great deal of good to my fellowcreatures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there had been any system left to be invented they would have found it out at the universities long before this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they cannot find it out because their teachers dont come in contact with the class which demands such a systemthat is those who have had no preliminary training <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my plan is one for instilling high knowledge into empty minds without first cramming them with what has to be uncrammed again before true study begins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might have believed you if you had kept yourself free from entanglements but this womanif she had been a good girl it would have been bad enough but being she is a good girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her surname even is not her true one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is captain vyes granddaughter and her father merely took her mothers name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they call him captain but anybody is captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt he has been to sea in some tub or other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no lady would rove about the heath at all hours of the day and night as she does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something queer between her and thomasins husband at one timei am as sure of it as that i stand here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did pay her a little attention a year ago but theres no harm in that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clym said his mother with firmness i have no proofs against her unfortunately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if she makes you a good wife there has never been a bad one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> believe me you are almost exasperating said yeobright vehemently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this very day i had intended to arrange a meeting between you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you give me no peace you try to thwart my wishes in everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hate the thought of any son of mine marrying badly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i had never lived to see this it is too much for meit is more than i dreamt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her breath was coming quickly and her lips were pale mother said clym whatever you do you will always be dear to methat you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but one thing i have a right to say which is that at my age i am old enough to know what is best for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yeobright remained for some time silent and shaken as if she could say no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it best for you to injure your prospects for such a voluptuous idle woman as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you do not know what is best for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you give up your whole thoughtyou set your whole soulto please a woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said his mother turning again to him with a tearful look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are unnatural clym and i did not expect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you did not know the measure you were going to mete me and therefore did not know the measure that would be returned to you again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you answer me you think only of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never yet supported what is bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i do not care only for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i care for you and for myself and for anything that is good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a woman once dislikes another she is merciless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please dont go setting down as my fault what is your obstinate wrongheadedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wished to connect yourself with an unworthy person why did you come home here to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why didnt you do it in paris?it is more the fashion there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have come only to distress me a lonely woman and shorten my days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish that you would bestow your presence where you bestow your love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will say no morebeyond this that i beg your pardon for having thought this my home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will no longer inflict myself upon you it was a sunny afternoon at the beginning of summer and the moist hollows of the heath had passed from their brown to their green stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yeobright walked to the edge of the basin which extended down from mistover and rainbarrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time he was calm and he looked over the landscape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the minor valleys between the hillocks which diversified the contour of the vale the fresh young ferns were luxuriantly growing up ultimately to reach a height of five or six feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he descended a little way flung himself down in a spot where a path emerged from one of the small hollows and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hither it was that he had promised eustacia to bring his mother this afternoon he was in a nest of vivid green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ferny vegetation round him though so abundant was quite uniformit was a grove of machinemade foliage a world of green triangles with sawedges and not a single flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air was warm with a vaporous warmth and the stillness was unbroken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lizards grasshoppers and ants were the only living things to be beheld <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scene seemed to belong to the ancient world of the carboniferous period when the forms of plants were few and of the fern kind when there was neither bud nor blossom nothing but a when he had reclined for some considerable time gloomily pondering he discerned above the ferns a drawn bonnet of white silk approaching from the left and yeobright knew directly that it covered the head of her he loved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his heart awoke from its apathy to a warm excitement and jumping to his feet he said aloud i knew she was sure to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she vanished in a hollow for a few moments and then only you here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she exclaimed with a disappointed air whose hollowness was proved by her rising redness and her halfguilty low laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i had known that you would be here alone she said seriously and that we were going to have such an idle pleasant time as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pleasure not known beforehand is half wasted to anticipate it is to double it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not thought once today of having you all to myself this afternoon and the actual moment of a thing is so soon gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never mind what islet us only look at what seems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still go on as we do nowjust live on from meeting to meeting never minding about another day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you i know are always thinking of thati can see you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are ever content to build their lives on any incidental position that offers itself whilst men would fain make a globe to suit them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a subject i have determined to put off no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your sentiment on the wisdom of carpe diem does not impress me today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our present mode of life must shortly be brought to an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i love you none the less in telling you it is only right you should know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have feared my bliss she said with the merest motion of her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are forty years of work in me yet and why should you despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish people wouldnt be so ready to think that there is no progress without uniformity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ahyour mind runs off to the philosophical side of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well these sad and hopeless obstacles are welcome in one sense for they enable us to look with indifference upon the cruel satires that fate loves to indulge in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard of people who upon coming suddenly into happiness have died from anxiety lest they should not live to enjoy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt myself in that whimsical state of uneasiness lately but i shall be spared it now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clym took the hand which was already bared for himit was a favourite way with them to walk bare hand in bare handand led her through the ferns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they formed a very comely picture of love at full flush as they walked along the valley that late afternoon the sun sloping down on their right and throwing their thin spectral shadows tall as poplar trees far out across the furze and fern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eustacia went with her head thrown back fancifully a certain glad and voluptuous air of triumph pervading her eyes at having won by her own unaided self a man who was her perfect complement in attainment appearance and age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the young mans part the paleness of face which he had brought with him from paris and the incipient marks of time and thought were less perceptible than when he returned the healthful and energetic sturdiness which was his by nature having partially recovered its original proportions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wandered onward till they reached the nether margin of the heath where it became marshy and merged they stood still and prepared to bid each other farewell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything before them was on a perfect level <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun resting on the horizon line streamed across the ground from between coppercoloured and lilac clouds stretched out in flats beneath a sky of pale soft green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are the russians really such a gloomy people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they merely take their sadness pleasurably just as we are accused of taking our pleasures sadly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you noticed that dreadful klopstock youth has been pounding past us at shortening intervals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell come up and talk if he half catches your eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isnt he at an agricultural college or something of the sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes studying to be a gentleman farmer he told me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt ask if both subjects were compulsory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre really rather dreadful said lady veula trying to look as if she thought so remember we are all equal in the sight of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a preacher of wholesome truths her voice rather lacked conviction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i and ernest klopstock are really equal in the sight of heaven said youghal with intense complacency i should recommend heaven to consult an eye specialist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a heavy spattering of loose earth and a squelching of saddleleather as the klopstock youth lumbered up to the rails and delivered himself of loud cheerful greetings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joyeuse laid his ears well back as the ungainly bay cob and his appropriately matched rider drew up beside him his verdict was reflected and endorsed by the cold stare of youghals eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been having a nailing fine time recounted the newcomer with clamorous enthusiasm i was over in paris last month and had lots of strawberries there then i had a lot more in london and now ive been having a late crop of them in herefordshire so ive had quite a lot this year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he laughed as one who had deserved well and received well of fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the charm of that story said youghal is that it can be told in any drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with a sweep of his widebrimmed hat to lady veula he turned the impatient joyeuse into the moving stream of horse and horsemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that woman reminds me of some verse ive read and liked thought youghal as joyeuse sprang into a light showy canter that gave full recognition to the existence of observant human beings along the side walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he quoted almost aloud as one does in the exhilaration of a how much i loved that way you had of smiling most when very sad a smile which carried tender hints of sun and spring and yet more than all other thing of weariness beyond all words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and having satisfactorily fitted lady veula on to a quotation he dismissed her from his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the constancy of her sex she thought about him his good looks and his youth and his railing tongue till late in the afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while youghal was putting joyeuse through his paces under the elm trees of the row a little drama in which he was directly interested was being played out not many hundred yards away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elaine and comus were indulging themselves in two pennyworths of park chair drawn aside just a little from the serried rows of sitters who were set out like bedded plants over an acre or so of turf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> comus was for the moment in a mood of pugnacious gaiety disbursing a fund of pointed criticism and unsparing anecdote concerning those of the promenaders or loungers whom he knew personally or by sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elaine was rather quieter than usual and the grave serenity of the leonardo da vinci portrait seemed intensified in her face this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his leisurely courtship comus had relied almost exclusively on his physical attraction and the fitful drollery of his wit and high spirits and these graces had gone far to make him seem a very desirable and rather lovable thing in elaines eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had left out of account the disfavour which he constantly risked and sometimes incurred from his frank and undisguised indifference to other peoples interests and wishes including at times elaines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the more that she felt that she liked him the more she was irritated by his lack of consideration for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without expecting that her every wish should become a law to him she would at least have liked it to reach the formality of a second reading <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another important factor he had also left out of his reckoning namely the presence on the scene of another suitor who also had youth and wit to recommend him and who certainly did not lack physical attractions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> comus marching carelessly through unknown country to effect what seemed already an assured victory made the mistake of disregarding the existence of an unbeaten army on his flank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the muskrat has built himself a house down the squirrels are laying up their store from while walking through the orchard i can theres an air of quiet comfort that only comes with fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind is cool and bracing and it makes and theres work to keep you going from so you feel like giving praises unto him nature heaps her blessings on you at this season and its fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nights are getting frosty and the fire i like to see the flames creep up among the away across the hilltops i can hear the hoot he is looking for his supper i guess he knows its fall <end> <end>

<start> <start> well when you get down to it i guess it doesnt mean so much <end> <end>

<start> <start> luis cer vantes who had been hiding amid a heap of ruins at the fortification on the crest of the hill made bold to show his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he had managed to hang on he did not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor did he know when demetrio and his men had disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he had found himself alone then hurled back by an avalanche of infantry he fell from his saddle a host of men trampled over him until he rose from the ground and a man on horseback hoisted him up behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a few moments horse and riders fell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> left without rifle revolver or arms of any kind cer vantes found himself lost in the midst of white smoke and whistling bullets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hole amid a debris of crumbling stone offered a refuge of safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> luis cervantes explained nobody threw me down solis said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im here be cause i like to play safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the irony in solis voice brought a blush to cer vantes cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by god that chief of yours is a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left me gaspingand a hell of a lot of other men with more experience than me too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you found a nice place for yourself at the right time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come here luis ill explain lets go behind that rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from this meadow to the foot of the hill theres no road save this path be low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the right the incline is too sharp you cant do anything there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and its worse to the left the ascent is so dangerous that a seconds hesitation means a fall down those rocks and a broken neck at the end of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a number of men from moyas brigade who went down to the meadow decided to attack the enemys trenches the first chance they got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bullets whizzed about us the battle raged on all sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time they stopped firing so we thought they were being attacked from behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stormed their trencheslook partner look at that meadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they mowed us down like wheat only a hand ful escaped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those goddamned officers went white as a sheet even though we had reinforcements they were afraid to order a new charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the hell does he think the officers surprised said nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> demetrios horse seemed to wear eagles claws instead of hoofs it soared so swiftly over the rocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his men shouted following him like wild deer horses and men welded into a mad stampede <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only one young fellow stepped wild and fell headlong into the pit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few sec onds the others appeared at the top of the hill storming the trenches and killing the federals by the thousand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with his rope demetrio lassoed the machine guns and carried them off like a bull herd throwing a steer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet his success could not last much longer for the federals were far stronger in numbers and could easily have de stroyed demetrio and his men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dropped all my own views of sense and nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him that taking all that he had told me as fact the prescences might be either ordinary minds traversing space in sleep or minds such as his which had independently captured the sense of spaces quality or finally the spirits of just men made perfect behaving as psychical researchers think they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a ridiculous task to set a prosaic man and i wasnt quite serious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he admitted that all three explanations were conceivable but he was very doubtful about the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the projection of the spirit into space during sleep he thought was a faint and feeble thing and these were powerful presences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the second and the third he was rather impressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i should have seen what was happening and tried to stop it at least looking back that seems to have been my duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was difficult to think that anything was wrong with hollond indeed the odd thing is that all this time the idea of madness never entered my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow the thing took my fancy though i thought it moonshine at the bottom of my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think i told him what may be waiting for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may open up a new world as rich as the old one but imperishable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may prove to mankind their immortality and deliver them for ever from the fear of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why man you are but hollond did not cheer up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is all true enough he saidif you are right if your alternatives are exhaustive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but suppose they are something else something what that something might be he had apparently no idea and very soon he went away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we asked me if i ever read poetry and i said not often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor did he but he had picked up a little book somewhere and found a man who knew about the presences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think his name was traherne one of the seventeenthcentury fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he quoted a verse which stuck to my within the region of the air compassed about with heavens fair great tracts of lands there may be found where many numerous hosts in those far distant coasts for other great and glorious ends hollond was positive he did not mean angels or anything of the sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him that traherne evidently took a cheerful view of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he admitted that but added he had religion you see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he believed that everything was for the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not a man of faith and can only take comfort from what i understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im in next week i was busy with the chilian arbitration case and saw nobody for a couple of months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then one evening i ran against hollond on the embankment and thought him looking horribly ill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked back with me to my rooms and hardly uttered one word all the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave him a stiff whiskyandsoda which he gulped down absentmindedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was that strained hunted look in his eyes that you see in a frightened animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was always lean but now he had fallen away to skin and bone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant stay long he told me for im off to the alps tomorrow and i have a lot to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before then he used to plunge readily into his story but now he seemed shy about beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed i had to ask him a question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> things are difficult he said hesitatingly and rather distressing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know leithen i think you were wrong aboutabout what i spoke to you of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said there must be one of three explanations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am beginning to think that there is a fourth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped for a second or two then suddenly leaned forward and gripped my knee so fiercely that i cried out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that world is the desolation he said in a choking voice and perhaps i am getting near the abomination of the desolation that the old prophet spoke of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you man i am on the edge of a terror a terror he almost screamed that no mortal can think of and you can imagine that i was considerably startled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was lightning out of a clear sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how the devil could one associate horror with mathematics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate i you may he sure i cursed my folly for ever pretending to take him seriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only way would have been to have laughed him out of it at the start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet i couldnt you knowit was too real and reasonable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow i tried a firm tone now and told him the whole thing was arrant raving bosh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bade him be a man and pull himself together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made him dine with me and took him home and got him into a better state of mind before he went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next morning i saw him off at charing cross very haggard still but better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he promised to write to me pretty often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pony with a great elevenpointer lurching athwart its back was abreast of us and from the autumn mist came the sound of soft highland voices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leithen and i got up to go when we heard that the rifle had made direct for the lodge by a short cut past the sanctuary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the wake of the gillies we descended the correi road into a glen all swimming with dim purple shadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pony minced and boggled the stags antlers stood out sharp on the rise against a patch of sky looking like a skeleton tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we dropped into a covert of birches and emerged on the white glen highway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leithens story had bored and puzzled me at the start but now it had somehow gripped my fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> space a domain of endless corridors and presences moving in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the world was not quite the same as an hour ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the hour as the french say between dog and wolf when the mind is disposed to marvels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought of my stalking on the morrow and was miserably conscious that i would miss my stag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those airy forms would get in the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to hear the end of your story i told him as the lights of the lodge showed half a mile distant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the end was a tragedy he said slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont much care to talk about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i couldnt believe it was all nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i still think there was something in itup to a point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i agree he went mad in the end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something must have snapped in that fine brain and he saw the little bit more which we call madness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank god you and i are prosaic fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was going out to chamonix myself a week later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before i started i got a postcard from hollond the only word from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had printed my name and address and on the other side had scribbled six words i know at lastgods mercy.h.g.h the handwriting was like a sick man of ninety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that things must be pretty bad with my friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got to chamonix in time for his funeral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an ordinary climbing accidentyou probably read about it in the papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the press talked about the toll which the alps took from intellectualsthe usual rot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the earl said that kari should try the feeling of njals sons as to an atonement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that kari spoke to helgi and asked whether he would take any amends from the earl or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will take them said helgi from his son eric but i will have nothing to do with the earl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shall take the amends from me if he thinks it better and tell them this too that i bid them to my house and my father shall do them no harm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this bidding they took and went to erics house and were with him till kari was ready to sail west across the sea to meet earl sigurd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then eric made a feast for kari and gave him gifts and njals sons gifts too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that kari fared west across the sea and met earl sigurd and he greeted them very well and they were with the earl that winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when the spring came kari asked njals sons to go on warfare with him but grim said they would only do so if he would fare with them afterwards out to iceland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kari gave his word to do that and then they fared with him asearoving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they harried south about anglesea and all the southern isles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thence they held on to cantyre and landed there and fought with the landsmen and got thence much goods and so fared to their ships <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thence they fared south to wales and harried there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they held on for alan and there they met godred and fought with him and got the victory and slew dungal the kings son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thence they held on north to coll and found earl gilli there and he greeted them well and there they stayed with him a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl fared with them to the orkneys to meet earl sigurd but next spring earl sigurd gave away his sister nereida to earl gilli and then he fared back to the southern isles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that summer kari and njals sons busked them for iceland and when they were allboun they went to see the earl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl gave them good gifts and they parted with great friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now they put to sea and have a short passage and they got a fine fair breeze and made the land at eyrar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they got them horses and ride from the ship to bergthorsknoll but when they came home all men were glad to see them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they flitted home their goods and laid up the ship and kari was there that winter with njal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the spring after kari asked for njals daughter helga to wife and helgi and grim backed his suit and so the end of it was that she was betrothed to kari and the day for the wedding feast was fixed and the feast was held half a month before midsummer and they were that winter with njal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then kari bought him land at dyrholms east away by mydale and set up a farm there they put in there a grieve and housekeeper to see after the farm but they themselves were ever with njal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hrapp owned a farm at hrappstede but for all that he was always at gritwater and he was thought to spoil everything there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once on a time it happened that kettle of the mark was at bergthorsknoll then njals sons told him of their wrongs and hardships and said they had much to lay at thrain sigfus sons door whenever they chose to speak about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> njai said it would be best that kettle should talk with his brother thrain about it and he gave his word to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they gave kettle breathingtime to talk to thrain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little after they spoke of the matter again to kettle but he said that be would repeat few of the words that had passed between them for it was pretty plain that thrain thought i set too great store on being your brotherinlaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they dropped talking about it and thought they saw that things looked ugly and so they asked their father for his counsel as to what was to be done but they told him they would not let things rest as they then stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such things said njal are not so strange <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be thought that they are slain without a cause if they are slain now and my counsel is that as many men as may be should be brought to talk with them about these things and thus as many as we can find may be earwitnesses if they answer ill as to these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then kari shall talk about them too for he is just the man with the right turn of mind for this then the dislike between you will grow and grow for they will heap bad words on bad words when men bring the matter forward for they are foolish men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may also well be that it may be said that my sons are slow to take up a quarrel but ye shall bear that for the sake of gaining time for there are two sides to everything that is done and ye can always pick a quarrel but still ye shall let so much of your purpose out as to say that if any wrong be put upon you that ye do mean something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if ye had taken counsel from me at first then these things should never have been spoken about at all and then ye would have gotten no disgrace from them but now ye have the greatest risk of it and so it will go on ever growing and growing with your disgrace that ye will never get rid of it until ye bring yourselves into a strait and have to fight your way out with weapons but in that there is a long and weary night in which ye will have to grope your way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that they ceased speaking about it but the matter became the daily talk of many men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day it happened that those brothers spoke to kari and bade him go to gritwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kari said he thought he might go elsewhither on a better journey but still he would go if that were njals counsel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so after that kari fares to meet thrain and then they talk over the matter and they did not each look at it in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kari comes home and njals sons ask how things had gone between thrain and him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kari said he would rather not repeat the words that had passed but he went on it is to be looked for that the like words will be spoken when ye yourselves can hear them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thrain had fifteen housecarles trained to arms in his house and eight of them rode with him whithersoever he went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thrain was very fond of show and dress and always rode in a blue cloak and had on a gilded helm and the spear the earls gift in his band and a fair shield and a sword at his belt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along with him always went gunnar lambis son and lambi sigurds son and grani gunnar of lithends son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but nearest of all to him went killing hrapp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lodinn was the name of his servingman he too went with thrain when he journeyed tjorvi was the name of lodinns brother and he too was one of thrains band <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the worst of all in their words against njals sons were hrapp and grani and it was mostly their doing that no atonement was offered to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> njals sons often spoke to kari that he should ride with them and it came to that at last for he said it would be well that they heard thrains answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they busked them four of njals sons and kari the fifth and so they fare to gritwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a wide porch in the homestead there so that many men might stand in it side by side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a woman out of doors and she saw their coming and told thrain of it he bade them to go out into the porch and take their arms and they did so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thrain stood in middoor but killinghrapp and grani gunnars son stood on either hand of him then next stood gunnar lambis son then lodinn and tjorvi then lambi sigurds son then each of the others took his place right and left for the housecarles were all at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> skarphedinn and his men walk up from below and he went first then kari then hauskuld then grim then helgi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when they had come up to the door then not a word of welcome passed the lips of those who stood before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hallgerda stood in the porch and had been talking low to hrapp then she spoke out loud none of those who are here will say that ye are welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prop of seawaves fire thy fretting cannot cast a weight on us warriors wight yes wolf and eagle willingly i feed today carline thrust into the ingle or a tramping whore art thou lord of skates that skim the seabelt odins mocking cup i mix thy words said skarphedinn will not be worth much for thou art either a hag only fit to sit in the ingle or a harlot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these words of thine thou shalt pay for she says ere thou farest home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thee am i come to see thrain said helgi and to know if thou wilt make me any amends for those wrongs and hardships which befell me for thy sake in norway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never knew said thrain that ye two brothers were wont to measure your manhood by money or how long shall such a claim for amends stand over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many will say says helgi that thou oughtest to offer us atonement since thy life was at stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then hrapp said twas just luck that swayed the balance when he got stripes who ought to bear them and she dragged you under disgrace and hardships but us away from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little good luck was there in that says helgi to break faith with the earl and to take to thee instead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thinkest thou not that thou hast some amends to seek from me says hrapp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will atone thee in a way that methinks were fitting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only dealings we shall have says helgi will be those which will not stand thee in good stead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont bandy words with hrapp said skarphedinn but give him a hold thy tongue skarphedinn said hrapp or i will not spare to bring my axe on thy head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twill be proved soon enough i dare say says skarphedinn which of us is to scatter gravel over the others head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says hallgerda and so we will call you always from this day forth but your father we will call the beardless carle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did not fare home before all who were there had made themselves guilty of uttering those words save thrain he forbade men to utter them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then njals sons went away and fared till they came home then they told their father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did ye call any men to witness of those words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we called none says skarphedinn we do not mean to follow that suit up except on the battlefield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one will now think says bergthora that ye have the heart to lift your weapons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says kari in egging on thy sons for they will be quite eager enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that they all talk long in secret njal and his sons and kari solmunds son their brotherinlaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> l prop of seawaves fire a periphrasis for woman that bears gold on her arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an allusion to the beast epic where the cunning fox laughs at the flayed condition of his stupid foes the wolf and bear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we should say dont stop to speak with him but rather beat him black and blue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there was great talk about this quarrel of theirs and all seemed to know that it would not settle down peacefully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> runolf the son of wolf aurpriest east in the dale was a great friend of thrains and had asked thrain to come and see him and it was settled that he should come east when about three weeks or a month were wanting to winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thrain bade hrapp and grani and gunnar lambis son and lambi sigurds son and lodinn and tjorvi eight of them in all to go on this journey with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time thrain gave it out that he meant to stay in the mark with his brother kettle and said how many nights he meant to be away from home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they rode east across markfleet and found there some gangrel women and they begged them to put them across the fleet west on their horses and they did so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they rode into the dale and had a hearty welcome there kettle of the mark met them and there they sate two nights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both runolf and kettle besought thrain that he would make up his quarrel with njals sons but he said he would never pay any money and answered crossly for he said he thought himself quite a match for njals sons wherever they met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it may be says runolf but so far as i can see no man has been their match since gunnar of lithend died and it is likelier that ye will both drag one another down to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thrain said that was not to be dreaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with despair i pictured to myself how coldly and disdainfully that scoundrel zverkov would meet me with what dullwitted invincible contempt the blockhead trudolyubov would look at me with what impudent rudeness the insect ferfitchkin would snigger at me in order to curry favour with zverkov how completely simonov would take it all in and how he would despise me for the abjectness of my vanity and lack of spiritand worst of all how paltry unliterary commonplace it would all be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course the best thing would be not to go at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that was most impossible of all if i feel impelled to do anything i seem to be pitchforked into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have jeered at myself ever afterwards so you funked it you funked it you funked the real thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary i passionately longed to show all that rabble that i was by no means such a spiritless creature as i seemed to myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is more even in the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever i dreamed of getting the upper hand of dominating them carrying them away making them like meif only for my elevation of thought and unmistakable wit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would abandon zverkov he would sit on one side silent and ashamed while i should crush him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then perhaps we would be reconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship but what was most bitter and humiliating for me was that i knew even then knew fully and for certain that i needed nothing of all this really that i did not really want to crush to subdue to attract them and that i did not care a straw really for the result even if i did achieve it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how i prayed for the day to pass quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in unutterable anguish i went to the window opened the movable pane and looked out into the troubled darkness of the thickly falling wet snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last my wretched little clock hissed out five <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seized my hat and trying not to look at apollon who had been all day expecting his months wages but in his foolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it i slipped between him and the door and jumping into a highclass sledge on which i spent my last half rouble i drove up in grand style to the hotel de paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been certain the day before that i should be the first to arrive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was not a question of being the first to arrive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only were they not there but i had difficulty in finding our room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a good many questions i elicited from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five but for six oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt really ashamed to go on questioning them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me knowthat is what the post is for and not to have put me in an absurd position in my own eyes and and even before the waiters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat down the servant began laying the table i felt even more humiliated when he was present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards six oclock they brought in candles though there were lamps burning in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had not occurred to the waiter however to bring them in at once when i arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the next room two gloomy angry looking persons were eating their dinners in silence at two different tables <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a great deal of noise even shouting in a room further away one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people and nasty little shrieks in french there were ladies at the dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rarely passed more unpleasant moments so much so that when they did arrive all together punctually at six i was overjoyed to see them as though they were my deliverers and even forgot that it was incumbent upon me to show resentment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> zverkov walked in at the head of them evidently he was the leading spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and all of them were laughing but seeing me zverkov drew himself up a little walked up to me deliberately with a slight rather jaunty bend from the waist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook hands with me in a friendly but not over friendly fashion with a sort of circumspect courtesy like that of a general as though in giving me his hand he were warding off something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had imagined on the contrary that on coming in he would at once break into his habitual thin shrill laugh and fall to making his insipid jokes and witticisms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been preparing for them ever since the previous day but i had not expected such condescension such highofficial courtesy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so then he felt himself ineffably superior to me in every respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he only meant to insult me by that highofficial tone it would not matter i thoughti could pay him back for it one way or another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what if in reality without the least desire to be offensive that sheepshead had a notion in earnest that he was superior to me and could only look at me in a patronising way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was surprised to hear of your desire to join us he began lisping and drawling which was something new <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is because humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find its way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think then that in the sphere of action a conscious aim is a delusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we lived long enough to see the results of our actions it may be that those who call themselves good would be sickened with a dull remorse and those whom the world calls evil stirred by a noble joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each little thing that we do passes into the great machine of life which may grind our virtues to powder and make them worthless or transform our sins into elements of a new civilisation more marvellous and more splendid than any that has gone before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they rage against materialism as they call it forgetting that there has been no material improvement that has not spiritualised the world and that there have been few if any spiritual awakenings that have not wasted the worlds faculties in barren hopes and fruitless aspirations and empty or trammelling creeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is termed sin is an essential element of progress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without it the world would stagnate or grow old or become colourless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by its curiosity sin increases the experience of the race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through its intensified assertion of individualism it saves us from monotony of type <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in its rejection of the current notions about morality it is one with the higher ethics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> renan tells us cares little about chastity and it may be that it is to the shame of the magdalen and not to their own purity that the lucretias of modern life owe their freedom from stain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charity as even those of whose religion it makes a formal part have been compelled to acknowledge creates a multitude of evils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mere existence of conscience that faculty of which people prate so much nowadays and are so ignorantly proud is a sign of our imperfect development <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be merged in instinct before we become fine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selfdenial is simply a method by which man arrests his progress and selfsacrifice a survival of the mutilation of the savage part of that old worship of pain which is so terrible a factor in the history of the world and which even now makes its victims day by day and has its altars in the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is well for our vanity that we slay the criminal for if we suffered him to live he might show us what we had gained by his crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us go back to the more gracious fields of literature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it was more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i believe i ventured upon that simple truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely you see now that i am right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was easy enough on the sandy plains by windy ilion to send the notched arrow from the painted bow or to hurl against the shield of hide and flamelike brass the long ashhandled spear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was easy for the adulterous queen to spread the tyrian carpets for her lord and then as he lay couched in the marble bath to throw over his head the purple net and call to her smoothfaced lover to stab through the meshes at the heart that should have broken at aulis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for antigone even with death waiting for her as her bridegroom it was easy to pass through the tainted air at noon and climb the hill and strew with kindly earth the wretched naked corse that had no tomb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what of those who wrote about these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what of those who gave them reality and made them live for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are they not greater than the men and women they sing of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hector that sweet knight is dead and lucian tells us how in the dim underworld menippus saw the bleaching skull of helen and marvelled that it was for so grim a favour that all those horned ships were launched those beautiful mailed men laid low those towered cities brought to dust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet every day the swanlike daughter of leda comes out on the battlements and looks down at the tide of war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the greybeards wonder at her loveliness and she stands by the side of the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his chamber of stained ivory lies her leman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is polishing his dainty armour and combing the scarlet plume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with squire and page her husband passes from tent to tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she can see his bright hair and hears or fancies that she hears that clear cold voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the courtyard below the son of priam is buckling on his brazen cuirass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white arms of andromache are around his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sets his helmet on the ground lest their babe should be frightened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind the embroidered curtains of his pavilion sits achilles in perfumed raiment while in harness of gilt and silver the friend of his soul arrays himself to go forth to the fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from a curiously carven chest that his mother thetis had brought to his shipside the lord of the myrmidons takes out that mystic chalice that the lip of man had never touched and cleanses it with brimstone and with fresh water cools it and having washed his hands fills with black wine its burnished hollow and spills the thick grapeblood upon the ground in honour of him whom at dodona barefooted prophets worshipped and prays to him and knows not that he prays in vain and that by the hands of two knights from troy panthous son euphorbus whose lovelocks were looped with gold and the priamid the lionhearted patroklus the comrade of comrades must meet his doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it dies at the moment of its energy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the world is made by the singer for the dreamer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while you talk it seems to me to be so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the mouldering citadel of troy lies the lizard like a thing of green bronze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the owl has built her nest in the palace of priam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day was sunday and the church bells had little rest indeed i do not think i remember anywhere else so great a choice of services as were here offered to the devout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and while the bells made merry in the sunshine all the world with his dog was out shooting among the beets and colza <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning a hawker and his wife went down the street at a footpace singing to a very slow lamentable music o france mes amours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it brought everybody to the door and when our landlady called in the man to buy the words he had not a copy of them left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not the first nor the second who had been taken with the song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is something very pathetic in the love of the french people since the war for dismal patriotic musicmaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have watched a forester from alsace while some one was singing les malheurs de la france at a baptismal party in the neighbourhood of fontainebleau <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he arose from the table and took his son aside close by where i was standing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> listen listen he said bearing on the boys shoulder and remember this my son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little after he went out into the garden suddenly and i could hear him sobbing in the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the humiliation of their arms and the loss of alsace and lorraine made a sore pull on the endurance of this sensitive people and their hearts are still hot not so much against germany as against the empire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in what other country will you find a patriotic ditty bring all the world into the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but affliction heightens love and we shall never know we are englishmen until we have lost india <end> <end> 
<start> <start> independent america is still the cross of my existence i cannot think of farmer george without abhorrence and i never feel more warmly to my own land than when i see the stars and stripes and remember what our empire might have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hawkers little book which i purchased was a curious mixture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> side by side with the flippant rowdy nonsense of the paris music halls there were many pastoral pieces not without a touch of poetry i thought and instinct with the brave independence of the poorer class in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there you might read how the woodcutter gloried in his axe and the gardener scorned to be ashamed of his spade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not very well written this poetry of labour but the pluck of the sentiment redeemed what was weak or wordy in the expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the martial and the patriotic pieces on the other hand were tearful womanish productions one and all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poet had passed under the caudine forks he sang for an army visiting the tomb of its old renown with arms reversed and sang not of victory but of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a number in the hawkers collection called conscrits francais which may rank among the most dissuasive warlyrics on record <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would not be possible to fight at all in such a spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bravest conscript would turn pale if such a ditty were struck up beside him on the morning of battle and whole regiments would pile their arms to its tune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if fletcher of saltoun is in the right about the influence of national songs you would say france was come to a poor pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the thing will work its own cure and a soundhearted and courageous people weary at length of snivelling over their disasters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already paul deroulede has written some manly military verses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said little brook you are going wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must follow me follow me follow i say do as i tell you and come this way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the songsinging singsonging forest brook followed him followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and pale and wan the dead leaves rustled as the water ran <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and every bird high up on the bough he called and the creatures obeyed the call squirrels that carried their tails like a sack householder snails and slugs all tails and weasels and ousels and mice and larks all went running and creeping and flowing the dappled fawns fawning the fallowdeer following cockchafers henchafers cockiolibirds cockroaches henroaches cuckoos in herds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spider forgot and followed him spinning and lost all his thread from end to beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gay wasp forgot his rings and his waist he never had made such undignified haste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dragonflies melted to mist with their hurrying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mole in his moleskins left his barrowing burrowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bees went buzzing so busy and beesy and the midges in columns so upright and easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but little boy blue was not content blowing his horn and beating his drum and crying aloud come all of you come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said to the shadows come after me and they flew through the wood all flattering and fluttering over the dead leaves flickering and muttering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he said to the wind come follow come follow with whistle and pipe and rustle and hollo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the wind wound round at his desire as if he had been the gold cock on the spire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the cock itself flew down from the church and left the farmers all in the lurch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they run and they fly they creep and they come everything everything all and some <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very trees they tugged at their roots after him leaning and straining and bending till out of the wood he burst on a lea shouting and calling come after me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they rose up with a leafy hiss and stood as if nothing had been amiss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little boy blue sat down on a stone and the creatures came round him every one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he said to the clouds i want you there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and down they sank through the thin blue air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he said to the sunset far in the west come here i want you i know best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the sunset came and stood up on the wold and burned and glowed in purple and gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then little boy blue began to ponder whats to be done with them all i wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then little boy blue he said quite low what to do with you all i am sure i dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the clouds clodded down till dismal it grew the brook sat up like a snake on its tail and all the creatures sat and stared and for rats and bats and the world and his wife little boy blue was afraid of his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then birdie brown began to sing you have brought us all hither little boy blue pray what do you want us all to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said little boy blue im sure i dont want you get away do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no no no no yes and no no sang birdie brown it mustnt be so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cannot for nothing come here and away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give us some work or else we stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with sob and with sigh said little boy blue and began to cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before he got far he thought of a thing and up he stood and spoke like a king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do you hustle and jostle and bother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sunset stood at the gates of the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> follow me follow me came from birdie browns breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going that way as fast as i can said the brook as it sank and turned and ran <end> <end> 
<start> <start> back to the woods fled the shadows like ghosts if we stay we shall all be missed from our posts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the wind with a voice that had changed its cheer i was just going there when you brought me here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats where i live said the sackbacked squirrel and he turned his sack with a swing and a swirl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the cock of the spire his fathers churchwarden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the brook running faster i run through his garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the mole two hundred worms there i caught em last year and im going again next autumn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said they all if thats where you want us to steer for what in earth or in water did you bring us here for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never you mind said little boy blue ill get up at once and go home without you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i will i begin to doubt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rose and up rose the snake on its tail and hissed three times half a hiss half a wail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little boy blue he tried to go past him but wherever he turned sat the snake and faced him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont get out of my way he said i tell you snake i will break your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the snake he neither would go nor come so he hit him hard with the stick of his drum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the snake fell down as if he were dead and little boy blue set his foot on his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the creatures they marched before him and marshalled him home with a high cockolorum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and birdie brown sang twirrrr twitter twirrrr twee apples and cherries roses and honey little boy blue has listened to me all so jolly and funny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im the oskaloosa kid replied the youth unable to resist the admiration of the others fond gaze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he fished a handful of jewelry from one of his side pockets this is some of the swag i stole last night when i robbed a house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> opened his mouth and eyes so wide that there was little left of his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> case but there was that in his facial expression which brought to the oskaloosa kid a sudden regret that he had thus rashly confided in a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say said the kid after a moments strained silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youll promise ill give you a dollar and he hunted through his roll of bills for one of that lowly denomination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont say a word wheres the dollar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the youth drew a bill from his roll and handed it to the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you tell he whispered and he bent close toward the others ear and spoke in a menacing tone if you tell ill kill you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this moment case pere and mere emerged from the kitchen loaded with provender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres enough an moren enough i reckon said jeb case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got eggs butter bread bacon milk an a mite o garden sass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we aint goin to charge you nothin fer the gar den sass interjected mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats awfully nice of you replied the kid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much do i owe you for the rest of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh said jeb case rubbing his chin eyeing the big roll of bills and wondering just the limit he might raise to i reckon bout four dollars an six bits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the oskaloosa kid peeled a five dollar bill from his roll and proffered it to the farmer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im ever so much obliged he said and you neednt mind about any change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with which he took the several packages and pails and turned toward the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wisht id asked six bits morei mought jest as well o got it as not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> back down the sticky road plodded the oskaloosa kid his arms heavy and his heart light for was he not bringing home the bacon literally as well as figuratively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he entered the squibbs gateway he saw the girl and bridge standing upon the verandah waiting his coming and as he approached them and they caught a nearer view of his great burden of provisions they hailed him with loud acclaim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to think that i doubted your ability to make a successful touch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are the ne plus ultra non est cumquidibus in hoc signo vinces only and original kind of handout compellers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how in the world did you do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh its easy when you know how replied the oska loosa kid carelessly as with the help of the others he carried the fruits of his expedition into the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here bridge busied himself about the stove adding more wood to the fire and scrubbing a portion of the top plate as clean as he could get it with such crude means as he could discover about the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the youth he sent to the nearby brook for water after selecting the least dirty of the several empty tin cans lying about the floor of the summer kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he warned against the use of the water from the old well and while the boy was away cut a generous portion of the bacon into long thin strips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straight i have and i guess you know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre about the only girl that i ever knew well and i guess he declared deliberately youre about the only one i want to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt say anything that time when we stood there together and delaney was playing the fool but somehow i got the idea that you didnt want delaney to do for me one little bit that if hed got me then you would have been sorrier than if hed got any one else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i felt just that way about you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would rather have had him shoot any other girl in the room than you yes or in the whole state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why if anything should happen to you miss hilmawell i wouldnt care to go on with anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and delaney could shoot me full of holes whenever he got good and ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt care a whoop about anything any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are the only girl for me in the whole world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but seeing you around every day and seeing how pretty you were and how clever and hearing your voice and all why it just got all inside of me somehow and now i cant think of anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hate to go to san francisco or sacramento or visalia or even bonneville for only a day just because you arent there in any of those places and i just rush what ive got to do so as i can get back here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while you were away that christmas time why i was as lonesome asoh you dont know anything about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i just scratched off the days on the calendar every night one by one till you got back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it just comes to this i want you with me all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you should have a home thats my home too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to take care of you and have you all for myself you understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilma standing up before him retied a knot in her handkerchief bundle with elaborate precaution blinking at it through her tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think we could hit it off together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annixter got up cast away his cigar and dropping the buckskins bridle came and stood beside her putting a hand on her shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilma did not move and he felt her trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she still plucked at the knot of the handkerchief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant do without you little girl annixter continued and i want you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont get much fun out of life ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody is trying to down me and now im up against the railroad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im fighting em all hilma night and day lock stock and barrel and im fighting now for my home my land everything i have in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i win out i want somebody to be glad with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i donti want somebody to be sorry for me sorry with meand that somebody is you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want some one to back me up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to feel you alongside of me to give me a touch of the shoulder now and then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im tired of fighting for thingsland property money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to fight for some personsomebody beside myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> want to feel that it isnt all selfishnessthat there are other interests than mine in the gamethat theres some one dependent on me and thats thinking of me as im thinking of themsome one i can come home to at night and put my arm aroundlike this and have her put her two arms around melike he paused a second and once again as it had been in that moment of imminent peril when he stood with his arm around her their eyes metput her two arms around me prompted annixter half smiling likelike what hilma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a movement of infinite tenderness and affection she slid her arms around his neck still crying a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sensation of her warm body in his embrace the feeling of her smooth round arm through the thinness of her sleeve pressing against his cheek thrilled annixter with a delight such as he had never known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he bent his head and kissed her upon the nape of her neck where the delicate amber tint melted into the thick sweet smelling mass of her dark brown hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shivered a little holding him closer ashamed as yet to look up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without speech they stood there for a long minute holding each other close <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then hilma pulled away from him mopping her tearstained cheeks with the little moist ball of her handkerchief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i hated you all the time she said and the velvety huskiness of her voice never sounded so sweet to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i thought it was that crockery smashing goat of a lout of a cowpuncher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think it must always have been you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah but it is good to have you my girl he exclaimed delighted beyond words that she permitted this freedom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was ever so long before i came to think of youto well to think abouti mean to rememberoh you know what i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont knowi havent thoughtthat way long enough to know <end> <end>

<start> <start> i know but that was differentoh im all mixed up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh she cried suddenly her face overcast with a look of earnestness and great seriousness both her hands catching at his wrist oh you will be good to me now wont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im only a little little child in so many ways and ive given myself to you all in a minute and i cant go back of it now and its for always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how it happened or why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i think i didnt wish it but now its done and i am glad and happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now if you werent good to meoh think of how it would be with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are strong and big and rich and i am only a servant of yours a little nobody but ive given all i had to youmyselfand you must be so good to me now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be good to me and be gentle and kind to me in little thingsin everything or you will break my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no words that thats all right little girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a long time they sat there under the shade of the great trestle their arms about each other speaking only at intervals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the buckskin finding no feed to her taste took the trail stablewards the bridle dragging <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rather than to take his arm from around hilmas waist he would have lost his whole stable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last however he bestirred himself and began to talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought it time to formulate some plan of action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well now hilma what are we going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to fix you up somewhere where you can have a bit of a home all to yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres always a lot of yaps about there that know us and they would begin to cackle first off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we might go up next week and have a look around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would find rooms you could take somewheres and we would fix em up as lovely as howdoyoudo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh but why go away from quien sabe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why must we have a wedding trip now that you are so busy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wouldnt it be betteroh i tell you we could go to monterey after we were married for a little week where mammas people live and then come back here to the ranch house and settle right down where we are and let me keep house for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gathered up a handful of pebbles and began snapping them carefully into the creek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was a phase of the affair he had not planned in the least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had supposed all the time that hilma took his meaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his old suspicion that she was trying to get a hold on him stirred again for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no good of such talk as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> always these feemale girls seemed crazy to get married bent on complicating the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets come right back to quien sabe without going to monterey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hadnt thought of it in just that way he observed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant wecant we wait about this marrying business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there would be so much to do between whiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not say at the end of the summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats the good of all that fuss about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont go anything upon a minister puddling round in my affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him a moment bewildered then slowly she took his meaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rose to her feet her eyes wide her face paling with terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not look at her but he could hear the catch in her throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she exclaimed with a long deep breath and again oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the back of her hand against her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a quick gasp of a veritable physical anguish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilma leaped back from him with an instinctive recoil of her whole being throwing out her hands in a gesture of defence fearing she knew not what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was as yet no sense of insult in her mind no outraged modesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as though searching for wild flowers she had come suddenly upon a snake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood for an instant spellbound her eyes wide her bosom swelling then all at once turned and fled darting across the plank that served for a foot bridge over the creek gaining the opposite bank and disappearing with a brisk rustle of underbrush such as might have been made by the flight of a frightened fawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he did not move then he picked up his campaign hat carefully creased its limp crown and put it on his head and stood for a moment looking vaguely at the ground on both sides of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went away without uttering a word without change of countenance his hands in his pockets his feet taking great strides along the trail in the direction of the ranch house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had no sight of hilma again that evening and the next morning he was up early and did not breakfast at the ranch house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> business of the league called him to bonneville to confer with magnus and the firm of lawyers retained by the league to fight the landgrabbing cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an appeal was to be taken to the supreme court at washington and it was to be settled that day which of the cases involved should be considered as test cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of driving or riding into bonneville as he usually did annixter took an early morning train the bakersfieldfresno local at guadalajara and went to bonneville by rail arriving there at twenty minutes after seven and breakfasting by appointment with magnus derrick and osterman at the yosemite house on main street the conference of the committee with the lawyers took place in a front room of the yosemite one of the latter bringing with him his clerk who made a stenographic report of the proceedings and took carbon copies of all letters written <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conference was long and complicated the business transacted of the utmost moment and it was not until two oclock that annixter found himself at liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however as he and magnus descended into the lobby of the hotel they were aware of an excited and interested group collected about the swing doors that opened from the lobby of the yosemite into the bar of the same name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dyke was thereeven at a distance they could hear the reverberation of his deeptoned voice uplifted in wrath and furious expostulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> magnus and annixter joined the group wondering and all at once fell full upon the first scene of a drama <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that same morning dykes mother had awakened him according to his instructions at daybreak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a consignment of his hop poles from the north had arrived at the freight office of the p <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in bonneville and he was to drive in on his farm wagon and bring them out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hello hello he said as his mother pulled his ear to arouse him morning mamma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took her hand and kissed it with great affection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he loved his mother devotedly quite as much as he did the little tad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in their little cottage in the forest of green hops that surrounded them on every hand the three led a joyous and secluded life contented industrious happy asking nothing better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dyke himself was a bighearted jovial man who spread an atmosphere of goodhumour wherever he went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the evenings he played with sidney like a big boy an older brother lying on the bed or the sofa taking her in his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between them they had invented a great game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the exengineer his boots removed his huge legs in the air hoisted the little tad on the soles of his stockinged feet like a circus acrobat dandling her there pretending he was about to let her fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sidney choking with delight held on nervously with little screams and chirps of excitement while he shifted her gingerly from one foot to another and thence the final act the great gallery play to the palm of one great hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dyke was called in both father and daughter children both crying out that she was to come in and look look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she arrived out of breath from the kitchen the potato masher in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such children she murmured shaking her head at them amused for all that tucking the potato masher under her arm and clapping her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the end it was part of the game that sidney should tumble down upon dyke whereat he invariably vented a great bellow as if in pain declaring that his ribs were broken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gasping his eyes shut he pretended to be in the extreme of dissolutionperhaps he was dying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sidney always a little uncertain amused but distressed shook him nervously tugging at his beard pushing open his eyelid with one finger imploring him not to frighten her to wake up and be good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this occasion while yet he was halfdressed dyke tiptoed into his mothers room to look at sidney fast asleep in her little iron cot her arm under her head her lips parted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with infinite precaution he kissed her twice and then finding one little stocking hung with its mate very neatly over the back of a chair dropped into it a dime rolled up in a wad of paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he winked all to himself and went out again closing the door with exaggerated carefulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dyke pouring his coffee and handing him his plate of ham and eggs and half an hour later took himself off in his springless skeleton wagon humming a tune behind his beard and cracking the whip over the backs of his staid and solid farm horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning was fine the sun just coming up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left guadalajara sleeping and lifeless on his left and going across lots over an angle of quien sabe came out upon the upper road a mile below the long trestle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was in great spirits looking about him over the brown fields ruddy with the dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost directly in front of him but far off the gilded dome of the courthouse at bonneville was glinting radiant in the first rays of the sun while a few miles distant toward the north the venerable campanile of the mission san juan stood silhouetted in purplish black against the flaming east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he proceeded the great farm horses jogging forward placid deliberate the country side waked to another day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crossing the irrigating ditch further on he met a gang of portuguese with picks and shovels over their shoulders just going to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hooven already abroad shouted him a goot mornun from behind the fence of los muertos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far off toward the southwest in the bare expanse of the open fields where a clump of eucalyptus and cypress trees set a dark green note a thin stream of smoke rose straight into the air from the kitchen of derricks ranch houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a mile or so beyond the long trestle he was surprised to see magnus derricks protege the onetime shepherd vanamee coming across quien sabe by a trail from one of annixters division houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without knowing exactly why dyke received the impression that the young man had not been in bed all of that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the two approached each other dyke eyed the young fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was distrustful of vanamee having the countrybred suspicion of any person he could not understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vanamee was beyond doubt no part of the life of ranch and country town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was an alien a vagabond a strange fellow who came and went in mysterious fashion making no friends keeping to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did he never wear a hat why indulge in a fine black pointed beard when either a round beard or a mustache was the invariable custom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above all why did he prowl about so much at night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the two passed each other dyke for all his goodnature was a little blunt in his greeting and looked back at the exshepherd over his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vanamees bed had not been disturbed for three nights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the monday of that week he had passed the entire night in the garden of the mission overlooking the seed ranch in the little valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tuesday evening had found him miles away from that spot in a deep arroyo in the sierra foothills to the eastward while wednesday he had slept in an abandoned dobe on ostermans stock range twenty miles from his resting place of the night before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact of the matter was that the old restlessness had once more seized upon vanamee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something began tugging at him the spur of some unseen rider touched his flank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the instinct of the wanderer woke and moved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some time now he had been a part of the los muertos staff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on quien sabe as on the other ranches the slack season was at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while waiting for the wheat to come up no one was doing much of anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vanamee had come over to los muertos and spent most of his days on horseback riding the range rounding up and watching the cattle in the fourth division of the ranch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if the vagabond instinct now roused itself in the strange fellows nature a counter influence had also set in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more and more vanamee frequented the mission garden after nightfall sometimes remaining there till the dawn began to whiten lying prone on the ground his chin on his folded arms his eyes searching the darkness over the little valley of the seed ranch watching watching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the days went by he became more reticent than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presley often came to find him on the stock range a lonely figure in the great wilderness of bare green hillsides but vanamee no longer took him into his confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dyke drove on toward bonneville thinking over the whole matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew as every one did in that part of the country the legend of vanamee and angele the romance of the mission garden the mystery of the other vanamees flight to the deserts of the southwest his periodic returns his strange reticent solitary character but like many another of the country people he accounted for vanamee by a short and easy method <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the long and short of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the exengineer reached the post office in bonneville towards eleven oclock but he did not at once present his notice of the arrival of his consignment at ruggless office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it entertained him to indulge in an hours lounging about the streets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was seldom he got into town and when he did he permitted himself the luxury of enjoying his evident popularity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles who was the palest of the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its natural and proper to be so am i said brittles only theres no call to tell a man he these frank admissions softened mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles who at once owned that he was afraid upon which they all three faced about and ran back again with the completest unanimity until mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles who had the shortest wind of the party as was encumbered with a pitchfork most handsomely insisted on stopping to make an apology for his hastiness of speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles when he had explained what a man will do when his blood is up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have committed murderi know i shouldif wed caught one of them as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment and as their blood like his had all gone down again some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt wonder if it was exclaimed brittles catching at the idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may depend upon it said giles that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt all mine suddenly going away as by a remarkable coincidence the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite obvious therefore that it was the gate especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse and who had been roused together with his two mongrel curs to join in the pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion brittles was a lad of allwork who having entered her service a mere child was treated as a promising young boy still though he was something past thirty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> encouraging each other with such converse as this but keeping very close together notwithstanding and looking apprehensively round whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs the three men hurried back to a tree behind which they had left their lantern lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> catching up the light they made the best of their way home at a good round trot and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air grew colder as day came slowly on and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grass was wet the pathways and low places were all mire and water the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by with a hollow moaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air become more sharp and piercing as its first dull huethe death of night rather than the birth of dayglimmered faintly in the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness grew more and more defined and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rain came down thick and fast and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but oliver felt it not as it beat against him for he still lay stretched helpless and unconscious on his bed of clay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed and uttering it the boy awoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his left arm rudely bandaged in a shawl hung heavy and useless at his side the bandage was saturated with blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture when he had done so he looked feebly round for help and groaned with pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trembling in every joint from cold and exhaustion he made an effort to stand upright but shuddering from head to foot fell prostrate on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged oliver urged by a creeping sickness at his heart which seemed to warn him that if he lay there he must surely die got upon his feet and essayed to walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his head was dizzy and he staggered to and from like a drunken man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he kept up nevertheless and with his head drooping languidly on his breast went stumbling onward he knew not whither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to be still walking between sikes and crackit who were angrily disputingfor the very words they said sounded in his ears and when he caught his own attention as it were by making some violent effort to save himself from falling he found that he was talking to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he was alone with sikes plodding on as on the previous day and as shadowy people passed them he felt the robbers grasp upon his wrist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he started back at the report of firearms there rose into the air loud cries and shouts lights gleamed before his eyes all was noise and tumult as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through all these rapid visions there ran an undefined uneasy conscious of pain which wearied and tormented him incessantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus he staggered on creeping almost mechanically between the bars of gates or through hedgegaps as they came in his way until he reached a road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the rain began to fall so heavily that it roused him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked about and saw that at no great distance there was a house which perhaps he could reach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pitying his condition they might have compassion on him and if they did not it would be better he thought to die near human beings than in the lonely open fields <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he summoned up all his strength for one last trial and bent his faltering steps towards it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he drew nearer to this house a feeling come over him that he had seen it before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remembered nothing of its details but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the grass inside he had fallen on his knees last night and prayed the two mens mercy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the very house they had attempted to rob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place that for the instant he forgot the agony of his wound and thought only of flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could scarcely stand and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame whither could he fly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pushed against the gardengate it was unlocked and swung open on its hinges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tottered across the lawn climbed the steps knocked faintly at the door and his whole strength failing him sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles brittles and the tinker were recruiting themselves after the fatigues and terrors of the night with tea and sundries in the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giless habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability which while it gratified could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but death fires and burglary make all men equals so mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender leaning his left arm on the table while with his right he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery to which his bearers but especially the cook and housemaid who were of the party listened with breathless interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles or i wouldnt swear that it mightnt have been a little nearer three when i woke up and turning round in my bed as it might be so here mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles turned round in his chair and pulled the corner of the tablecloth over him to imitate bedclothes i fancied i heerd a at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale and asked the housemaid to shut the door who asked brittles who asked the tinker who pretended not to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i says at first this is illusion and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd what sort of a noise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a kind of a busting noise replied mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeggrater suggested brittles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was when you heerd it sir rejoined mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles but at this time it had a busting sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned down the clothes continued giles rolling back the tablecloth sat up in bed the cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated lor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heerd it now quite apparent resumed mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody i says is forcing of a door or window whats to be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill call up that poor lad brittles and save him from being murdered in his bed or his throat i says may be cut from his here all eyes were turned upon brittles who fixed his upon the speaker and stared at him with his mouth wide open and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tossed off the clothes said giles throwing away the tablecloth and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid ladies present mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of shoes sir said giles turning upon him and laying great emphasis on the word seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the platebasket and walked on tiptoes to his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brittles i says when i had woke him dont be so you did observed brittles in a low voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were dead men i think brittles i says continued giles was he frightened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have died at once im sure if it had been me observed the housemaid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre a woman retorted brittles plucking up a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles nodding his head approvingly from a woman nothing else was to be expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we being men took a dark lantern that was standing on brittles hob and groped our way downstairs in the pitch darkas it mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles had risen from his seat and taken two steps with his eyes shut to accompany his description with appropriate action when he started violently in common with the rest of the company and hurried back to his chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in the morning said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles surveying the pale faces which surrounded him and looking very blank himself but the mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles as he spoke looked at brittles but that young man being naturally modest probably considered himself nobody and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him at all events he tendered no reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker but he had suddenly fallen asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if brittles would rather open the door in the presence of witnesses said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles after a short silence i am ready to so am i said the tinker waking up as suddenly as he had fallen asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brittles capitualated on these terms and the party being somewhat reassured by the discovery made on throwing open the shutters that it was now broad day took their way upstairs with the dogs in front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two women who were afraid to stay below brought up the rear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles they all talked very loud to warn any evildisposed person outside that they were strong in numbers and by a masterstoke of policy originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman the dogs tails were well pinched in the hall to make them bark savagely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles held on fast by the tinkers arm to prevent his running away as he pleasantly said and gave the word of command to open the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brittles obeyed the group peeping timourously over each others shoulders beheld no more formidable object than poor little oliver twist speechless and exhausted who raised his heavy eyes and mutely solicited their compassion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles valiantly pushing the tinker into the background <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats the matter with brittles who had got behind the door to open it no sooner saw oliver than he uttered a loud cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles seizing the boy by one leg and one arm fortunately not the broken limb lugged him straight into the hall and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bawled giles calling in a state of great excitement up the staircase heres one of the thieves maam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shot him miss and in a lantern miss cried brittles applying one hand to the side of his mouth so that his voice might travel the better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two womenservants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles had captured a robber and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore oliver lest he should die before he could be hanged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the midst of all this noise and commotion there was heard a sweet female voice which quelled it in an instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont be frightened miss i aint much injured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied the young lady you frighten my aunt as much as wounded desperate miss replied giles with indescribable complacency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looks as if he was agoing miss bawled brittles in the same manner as before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wouldnt you like to come and look at hush pray theres a good man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait with a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice the speaker tripped away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she soon returned with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried carefully upstairs to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giless room and that brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to chertsey from which place he was to despatch with all speed a constable and doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but wont you take one look at him first miss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles with as much pride as if oliver were some bird of rare plumage that he had skilfully brought down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not one little not now for the world replied the young lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old servant looked up at the speaker as she turned away with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then bending over oliver he helped to carry him upstairs with the care and solicitude of a woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has an introductory account of the inmates of the house to which in a handsome room though its furniture had rather the air of oldfashioned comfort than of modern elegance there sat two ladies at a wellspread breakfasttable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giles dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black was in attendance upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had taken his station some halfway between the sideboard and the breakfasttable and with his body drawn up to its full height his head thrown back and inclined the merest trifle on one side his left leg advanced and his right hand thrust into his waistcoat while his left hung down by his side grasping a waiter looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a long time each sat in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the englishman could guess why the other made no soundhe awaited the moment that sleep should overcome his victim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the long silence there was born upon bradleys ears a faint monotonous sound as of running water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to come from far beneath the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that sounds like water running through a narrow channel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it passes directly beneath the blue place of seven skulls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it runs through the temple grounds beneath the temple and under the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we die they will cut off our heads and throw our bodies into the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the mouth of the river await many large reptiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wieroos do likewise with their own dead keeping only the skulls and the wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do the reptiles come up the river into the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water is too coldthey never leave the warm water of the great pool replied antak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us search for the way out suggested bradley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have searched for it all these moons he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could not find it how would you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bradley made no reply but commenced a diligent examination of the walls and floor of the room pressing over each square foot and tapping with his knuckles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about six feet from the floor he discovered a sleepingperch near one end of the apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked antak about it but the galu said that no weiroo had occupied the place since he had been incarcerated there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again and again bradley went over the floor and walls as high up as he could reach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he swung himself to the perch that he might examine at least one end of the room all the way to the ceiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the center of the wall close to the top an area about three feet square gave forth a hollow sound when he rapped upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bradley felt over every square inch of that area with the tips of his fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the top he found a small round hole a trifle larger in diameter than his forefinger which he immediately stuck into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the panel if such it was seemed about an inch thick and beyond it his finger encountered nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bradley crooked his finger upon the opposite side of the panel and pulled toward him steadily but with considerable force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly the panel flew inward nearly precipitating the man to the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was hinged at the bottom and when lowered the outer edge rested upon the perch making a little platform parallel with the floor of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond the opening was an utterly dark void <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the englishman leaned through it and reached his arm as far as possible into the blackness but touched nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he fumbled in his haversack for a match a few of which remained to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he struck it antak gave a cry of terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bradley held the light far into the opening before him and in its flickering rays saw the top of a ladder descending into a black abyss below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how far down it extended he could not guess but that he should soon know definitely he was positive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now i am too weak to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will have the whole flock of birds around our heads in a minute and neither of us will escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i find a way out ill come back and help you if youll promise not to try to eat me up again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose thats the wet sea son too then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its exciting to see everything growing so fastand to get the grass cut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please leave the roses till last if you must cut them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i dont mean all of them i mean that low place down by my tree where there are so many <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at the spiderwebs all over the grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill call you if i see a snake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tripped away and emil stood looking after her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few moments he heard the cher ries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his scythe with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of rain drops on her neck and hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and emil mowed his way slowly down toward the cherry trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilder ness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all sorts of weeds and herbs and flowers had grown up there splotches of wild larkspur pale greenandwhite spikes of hoarhound plantations of wild cotton tangles of foxtail and wild wheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> south of the apricot trees cor nering on the wheatfield was franks alfalfa where myriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering above the purple blos soms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when emil reached the lower corner by the hedge marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree the pailful of cherries beside her looking off at the gentle tireless swelling of the wheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emil she said suddenlyhe was mowing quietly about under the tree so as not to disturb herwhat religion did the swedes have away back before they were christians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marie went on as if she had not heard him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bohemians you know were tree wor shipers before the missionaries came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father says the people in the mountains still do queer things sometimesthey believe that trees bring good or bad luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know all of them but i know lindens are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old people in the mountains plant lindens to purify the forest and to do away with the spells that come from the old trees they say have lasted from heathen times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a good catholic but i think i could get along with caring for trees if i hadnt anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a poor saying said emil stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i feel that way i feel that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel as if this tree knows everything i ever think of when i sit here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i come back to it i never have to re mind it of anything i begin just where i left off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruitlong ivorycolored ber ries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh ever so much only he seems kind of staid and schoolteachery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of course he is older than frank even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure i dont want to live to be more than thirty do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think alexandra likes him very much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasnt a little in love with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wouldnt know how to go about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh you dont know alexandra as well as you think you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you had any eyes you would see that she is very fond of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like him because he appreciates her more than you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and i have always been good friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely you are not thinking of going off there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man took up his scythe and leaned on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you rather i went off in the sand hills and lived like ivar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure alexandra hopes you will stay on here she murmured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then alexandra will be disappointed the young man said roughly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do i want to hang around here for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexandra can run the farm all right without me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to stand around and look on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to be doing something on my own account <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it shows how rich it is in discoveries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it is right at all it is a compliment to say that its elaborately right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stick might fit a hole or a stone a hollow by accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a key and a lock are both complex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if a key fits a lock you know it is the right key <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this involved accuracy of the thing makes it very difficult to do what i now have to do to describe this accumulation of truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very hard for a man to defend anything of which he is entirely convinced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is comparatively easy when he is only partially convinced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is partially convinced because he has found this or that proof of the thing and he can expound it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a man is not really convinced of a philosophic theory when he finds that something proves it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is only really convinced when he finds that everything proves it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the more converging reasons he finds pointing to this conviction the more bewildered he is if asked suddenly to sum them up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus if one asked an ordinary intelligent man on the spur of the moment why do you prefer civilization to savagery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would look wildly round at object after object and would only be able to answer vaguely why there is that bookcase and the coals in the coalscuttle and pianos and policemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole case for civilization is that the case for it is complex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that very multiplicity of proof which ought to make reply overwhelming makes reply impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is therefore about all complete conviction a kind of huge helplessness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the belief is so big that it takes a long time to get it into action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this hesitation chiefly arises oddly enough from an indifference about where one should begin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all roads lead to rome which is one reason why many people never get there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the case of this defence of the christian conviction i confess that i would as soon begin the argument with one thing as another i would begin it with a turnip or a taximeter cab <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if i am to be at all careful about making my meaning clear it will i think be wiser to continue the current arguments of the last chapter which was concerned to urge the first of these mystical coincidences or rather ratifications <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all i had hitherto heard of christian theology had alienated me from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a pagan at the age of twelve and a complete agnostic by the age of sixteen and i cannot understand any one passing the age of seventeen without having asked himself so simple a question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did indeed retain a cloudy reverence for a cosmic deity and a great historical interest in the founder of christianity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i certainly regarded him as a man though perhaps i thought that even in that point he had an advantage over some of his modern critics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i read the scientific and sceptical literature of my timeall of it at least that i could find written in english and lying about and i read nothing else i mean i read nothing else on any other note of philosophy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the penny dreadfuls which i also read were indeed in a healthy and heroic tradition of christianity but i did not know this at the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never read a line of christian apologetics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i read as little as i can of them now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was huxley and herbert spencer and bradlaugh who brought me back to orthodox theology <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sowed in my mind my first wild doubts of doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our grandmothers were quite right when they said that tom paine and the freethinkers unsettled the mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rationalist made me question whether reason was of any use whatever and when i had finished herbert spencer i had got as far as doubting for the first time whether evolution had occurred at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i laid down the last of colonel ingersolls atheistic lectures the dreadful thought broke across my mind almost thou persuadest me to be a christian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this odd effect of the great agnostics in arousing doubts deeper than their own might be illustrated in many ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i read and reread all the nonchristian or antichristian accounts of the faith from huxley to bradlaugh a slow and awful impression grew gradually but graphically upon my mindthe impression that christianity must be a most extraordinary thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for not only as i understood had christianity the most flaming vices but it had apparently a mystical talent for combining vices which seemed inconsistent with each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was attacked on all sides and for all contradictory reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner had one rationalist demonstrated that it was too far to the east than another demonstrated with equal clearness that it was much too far to the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner had my indignation died down at its angular and aggressive squareness than i was called up again to notice and condemn its enervating and sensual roundness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in case any reader has not come across the thing i mean i will give such instances as i remember at random of this selfcontradiction in the sceptical attack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i give four or five of them there are fifty more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus for instance i was much moved by the eloquent attack on christianity as a thing of inhuman gloom for i thought and still think sincere pessimism the unpardonable sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> insincere pessimism is a social accomplishment rather agreeable than otherwise and fortunately nearly all pessimism is insincere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if christianity was as these people said a thing purely pessimistic and opposed to life then i was quite prepared to blow up st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did prove to me in chapter i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to my complete satisfaction that christianity was too pessimistic and then in chapter ii <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they began to prove to me that it was a great deal too optimistic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one accusation against christianity was that it prevented men by morbid tears and terrors from seeking joy and liberty in the bosom of nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but another accusation was that it comforted men with a fictitious providence and put them in a pinkandwhite nursery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one great agnostic asked why nature was not beautiful enough and why it was hard to be free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another great agnostic objected that christian optimism the garment of makebelieve woven by pious hands hid from us the fact that nature was ugly and that it was impossible to be free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one rationalist had hardly done calling christianity a nightmare before another began to call it a fools paradise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> christianity could not at once be the black mask on a white world and also the white mask on a black world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with his words the young man flung himself upon norman of torn with drawn sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quicker than the eye could see the sword of the visored knight flew from its scabbard and with a single lightninglike move sent the blade of young de montfort hurtling cross the courtyard and then before either could take another step bertrade de montfort had sprung between them and placing a hand upon the breastplate of the outlaw stretched forth the other with palm outturned toward her kinsmen as though to pro tect norman of torn from further assault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be he outlaw or devil she cried he is a brave and courteous knight and he deserves from the hands of the de montforts the best hospitality they can give and not cold steel and insults <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she explained briefly to her astonished father and brothers what had befallen during the past few days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry de montfort with the fine chivalry that marked him was the first to step forward with outstretched hand to thank norman of torn and to ask his pardon for his rude words and hostile act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let the de montforts think well ere they take the hand of norman of torn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i give not my hand except in friendship and not for a passing moment but for life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i appreciate your present feelings of gratitude but let them not blind you to the fact that i am still norman the devil and that you have seen my mark upon the brows of your dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would gladly have your friendship but i wish it for the man norman of torn with all his faults as well as what virtues you may think him to possess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are right sir said the earl you have our gratitude and our thanks for the service you have ren dered the house of montfort and ever during our lives you may command our favors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i admire your bravery and your candor but while you continue the outlaw of torn you may not break bread at the table of de montfort as a friend would have the right to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your speech is that of a wise and careful man said norman of torn quietly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go but remember that from this day i have no quarrel with the house of simon de montfort and that should you need my arms they are at your service a thousand strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as he turned to go bertrade de montfort confronted him with outstretched hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must take my hand in friendship she said for to my dying day i must ever bless the name of norman of torn because of the horror from which he has rescued me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took the little fingers in his mailed hand and bending upon one knee raised them to his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to no otherwoman man king god or devil has norman of torn bent the knee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever you need him my lady bertrade remember that his services are yours for the asking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and turning he mounted and rode in silence from the courtyard of the castle of leicester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without a back ward glance and with his five hundred men at his back norman of torn disappeared beyond a turning in the roadway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a strange man said simon de montfort both good and bad but from today i shall ever believe more good than bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would that he were other than he be for his arm would wield a heavy sword against the ene mies of england an he could be persuaded to our cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who knows said henry de montfort but that an offer of friendship might have won him to a better life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed that in his speech was a note of wistfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish father that we had taken his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several days after norman of torns visit to the castle of leicester a young knight appeared before the earls gates demanding admittance to have speech with simon de montfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earl received him and as the young man entered his presence simon de montfort sprang to his feet in astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i be no prince my lord he said though some have said that i favor the kings son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i be roger de conde whom it may have pleased your gracious daugh ter to mention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have come to pay homage to bertrade de montfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah said de montfort rising to greet the young knight cordially an you be that roger de conde who rescued my daughter from the fellows of peter of col fax the arms of the de montforts are open to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertrade has had your name upon her tongue many times since her return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she will be glad indeed to re ceive you as is her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has told us of your valiant espousal of her cause and the thanks of her brothers and mother await you roger de conde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she also told us of your strange likeness to prince edward but until i saw you i could not believe two men could be born of different mothers and yet be so identical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come we will seek out my daughter and her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de montfort led the young man to a small chamber where they were greeted by princess eleanor his wife and by bertrade de montfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl was frankly glad to see him once more and laughingly chid him because he had allowed another to usurp his prerogative and rescue her from peter of colfax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to think she cried that it should have been norman of torn who fulfilled your duties for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he did not capture sir peters head my friend that is still at large to be brought to me upon a golden dish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not forgotten lady bertrade said roger de conde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very words of the outlaw of torn she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many men be ye roger de conde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with raised visor you could pass in the kings court for the kings son and in manner and form and swordsmanship and your visor lowered you might easily be hanged for norman of torn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and which would it please ye most that i be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither she answered i be satisfied with my friend roger de conde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his greeting was as hearty to herself as to any of the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> same old story is it knocks and bumps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how different this appellative sounded from him he said it in such a tone with such a rogueish look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughed and replied that he had better take her west for a housekeeper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack was pleased with jamess innovations of table discipline and would often tarry in the diningroom to see nig in her new place at the family table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he was thus sitting one day after the family had finished dinner frado seated herself in her mistress chair and was just reaching for a clean dessert plate which was on the table when her mistress entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put that plate down you shall not have a clean one eat from mine continued she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to eat after james his wife or jack would have been pleasant but to be command ed to do what was disagreeable by her mistress because it was disagreeable was trying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quickly looking about she took the plate called fido to wash it which he did to the best of his ability then wiping her knife and fork on the cloth she proceeded to eat her dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nig never looked toward her mistress during the process <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had jack near she did not fear her now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bellmont rushed to her husband and commanded him to notice this insult to whip that child if he would not do it james ought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> james came to hear the kitchen version of the affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he related all the circumstances to james and pulling a bright silver halfdollar from his pocket he threw it at nig saying there take that twas worth paying for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> james sought his mother told her he would not excuse or palliate nigs impudence but she should not be whipped or be punished at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not treated her mother so as to gain her love she is only exhibiting your remissness in this matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she only smothered her resentment until a convenient opportunity offered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first time she was left alone with nig she gave her a thorough beating to bring up arrearages and threatened if she ever exposed her to james she would cut her tongue out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> james found her upon his return sobbing but fearful of revenge she dared not answer his queries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was trampled under foot jimeng got a dozen gashes about his body and we were carried halfway up the yard in the first rush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my eyes and mouth were full of dust i was on my back with three or four fellows sitting on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could hear jimeng trying to shout not very far from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then they would throttle him and he would gurgle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could hardly breathe myself with two heavy fellows on my chest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> willems came up running and ordered them to raise me up but to keep good hold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked round but did not see either ali or the child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almayers face was distorted with a passing spasm of rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almayer went on after a they held me shouting threats in my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> willems took down my hammock and threw it to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pulled out the drawer of this table and found there a palm and needle and some sailtwine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were making awnings for your brig as you had asked me last voyage before you left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew of course where to look for what he wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by his orders they laid me out on the floor wrapped me in my hammock and he started to stitch me in as if i had been a corpse beginning at the feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i called him all the names i could think of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told them to put their dirty paws over my mouth and nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever i moved they punched me in the ribs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went on taking fresh needlefuls as he wanted them and working steadily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he rose saying that will do let go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that woman had been standing by they must have been reconciled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lay on the floor like a bale of goods while he stared at me and the woman shrieked with delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a grin on every face and the verandah was full of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wished myself deadpon my word captain lingard i did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do now whenever i think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almayer dropped his head upon his arms on the table and spoke in that position in an indistinct and muffled voice without looking up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally by his directions they flung me into the big rockingchair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sewed in so tight that i was stiff like a piece of wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was giving orders in a very loud voice and that man babalatchi saw that they were executed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime i lay there in the chair like a log and that woman capered before me and made faces snapped her fingers before my nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw her before as far as i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then she would leave me alone to hang round his neck for awhile and then she would return before my chair and begin her exercises again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the perspiration ran down my face got into my eyesmy arms were sewn in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was blinded half the time at times i could see better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am like white women she says her arms round his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should have seen the faces of the fellows in the verandah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were scandalized and ashamed of themselves to see her behaviour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly she asks him alluding to me when are you going to kill him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must have swooned i dont remember exactly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fancy there was a row he was angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i got my wits again he was sitting close to me and she was gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understood he sent her to my wife who was hiding in the back room and never came out during this affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> willems says to mei fancy i can hear his voice hoarse and dullhe says to me not a hair of your head shall be touched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he goes on please remark that the flag you have hoistedwhich by the by is not yourshas been respected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell captain lingard so when you do see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he says you first fired at the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it hurt him to see i was not frightened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyways he says a shot had been fired out of your compound and a man was hit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still all your property shall be respected on account of the union jack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover i have no quarrel with captain lingard who is the senior partner in this business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to you he continued you will not forget this daynot if you live to be a hundred years oldor i dont know your nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will keep the bitter taste of this humiliation to the last day of your life and so your kindness to me shall be repaid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall remove all the powder you have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this coast is under the protection of the netherlands and you have no right to have any powder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are the governors orders in council to that effect and you know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me where the key of the small storehouse is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said not a word and he waited a little then rose saying its your own fault if there is any damage done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ordered babalatchi to have the lock of the officeroom forced and went inrummaged amongst my drawerscould not find the key <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then that woman aissa asked my wife and she gave them the key <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after awhile they tumbled every barrel into the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he superintended himself and saw every barrel roll into the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> babalatchi was angry and tried to expostulate but he gave him a good shaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must say he was perfectly fearless with those fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he came back to the verandah sat down by me again and says we found your man ali with your little daughter hiding in the bushes up the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me congratulate you almayer upon the cleverness of your child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she recognized me at once and cried pig as naturally as you would yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should have seen how frightened your man ali was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really you look so ridiculous in this chair that i cant feel angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made a frantic effort to burst out of my hammock to get at that scoundrels throat but i only fell off and upset the chair over myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laughed and said only i leave you half of your revolver cartridges and take half myself they will fit mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are both white men and should back each other up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouted at him from under the chair you are a thief but he never looked and went away one hand round that womans waist the other on babalatchis shoulder to whom he was talkinglaying down the law about something or other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in less than five minutes there was nobody inside our fences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after awhile ali came to look for me and cut me free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent seen willems sincenor anybody else for that matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i offered sixty dollars to the man who had been wounded which were accepted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they released jimeng the next day when the flag had been hauled down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sent six cases of opium to me for safe keeping but has not left his house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards the end of his narrative almayer lifted his head off the table and now sat back in his chair and stared at the bamboo rafters of the roof above him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lingard lolled in his seat with his legs stretched out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the peaceful gloom of the verandah with its lowered screens they heard faint noises from the world outside in the blazing sunshine a hail on the river the answer from the shore the creak of a pulley sounds short interrupted as if lost suddenly in the brilliance of noonday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lingard got up slowly walked to the front rail and holding one of the screens aside looked out in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the water and the empty courtyard came a distinct voice from a small schooner anchored abreast of the lingard jetty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take a pull at the main peak halyards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gaff is there was a shrill pipe dying in longdrawn cadence the song of the men swinging on the rope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as lingard dropped the blind and turned away all was silent again as if there had been nothing on the other side of the swaying screen nothing but the light brilliant crude heavy lying on a dead land like a pall of fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lingard sat down again facing almayer his elbow on the table in a thoughtful attitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after i lost the flash we got to palembang in our boats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted a spell ashore so i took charge myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to go to singapore about the insurance then i went to macassar of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had lots of trouble with old hudig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old seaman had twisted his white beard into a point and now was busy giving his moustaches a fierce curl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his little red eyesthose eyes that had smarted under the salt sprays of every sea that had looked unwinking to windward in the gales of all latitudesnow glared at almayer from behind the lowered eyebrows like a pair of frightened wild beasts crouching in a bush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what can you have to do with hudigs women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wife of a friend of i mean of a man i know still i dont see interjected almayer carelessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew so many men before you made me bury myself in this hole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she had anything to do with hudigthat wifethen she cant be up to much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would be sorry for the man added almayer brightening up with the recollection of the scandalous tittletattle of the past when he was a young man in the second capital of the islandsand so well informed so well informed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almayer grasped the sides of his seat his eyes and mouth opened wide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i did not know what had happened here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve been giving her money i bet cried almayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although i suppose i shall have to almayer groaned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact is went on lingard speaking slowly and steadily the fact is that i have i have brought her here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the power of thought was restored he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no additional strangulation the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to die of hanging at the bottom of a river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light but how distant how inaccessible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was still sinking for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir said the wogglebug i take you for a gentleman of judgment and discernment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does it not occur to you that i am several thousand times greater than any wogglebug you ever saw before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore it is plainly evident that i am highly magnified and there is no good reason why you should doubt the fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my brains are slightly mixed since i was last laundered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would it be improper for me to ask also what the te <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of your name stands for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those letters express my degree answered the wogglebug with a condescending smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be more explicit the initials mean that i am thoroughly educated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tip had not yet taken his eyes off this wonderful personage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he saw was a great round buglike body supported upon two slender legs which ended in delicate feet the toes curling upward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the body of the wogglebug was rather flat and judging from what could be seen of it was of a glistening dark brown color upon the back while the front was striped with alternate bands of light brown and white blending together at the edges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its arms were fully as slender as its legs and upon a rather long neck was perched its head not unlike the head of a man except that its nose ended in a curling antenna or feeler and its ears from the upper points bore antennae that decorated the sides of its head like two miniature curling pig tails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be admitted that the round black eyes were rather bulging in appearance but the expression upon the wogglebugs face was by no means unpleasant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for dress the insect wore a darkblue swallowtail coat with a yellow silk tightly across the wide body knickerbockers of fawncolored plush fastened at the knees with gilt buckles and perched upon its small head was jauntily set a tall silk hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> standing upright before our amazed friends the wogglebug appeared to be fully as tall as the tin woodman and surely no bug in all the land of oz had ever before attained so enormous a size <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i confess said the scarecrow that your abrupt appearance has caused me surprise and no doubt has startled my companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope however that this circumstance will not distress you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall probably get used to you in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it affords me great pleasure to surprise people for surely i cannot be classed with ordinary insects and am entitled to both curiosity and admiration from those i meet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will permit me to seat myself in your august company continued the stranger i will gladly relate my history so that you will be better able to comprehend my unusual may i say remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may say what you please answered the tin woodman briefly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the wogglebug sat down upon the grass facing the little group of it is but honest that i should acknowledge at the beginning of my recital that i was born an ordinary wogglebug began the creature in a frank and friendly tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knowing no better i used my arms as well as my legs for walking and crawled under the edges of stones or hid among the roots of grasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects smaller than myself to feed upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless for i wore no clothing but each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life and restored me to activity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a horrible existence is this but you must remember it is the regular ordained existence of wogglebugs as well as of many other tiny creatures that inhabit the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but destiny had singled me out humble though i was for a grander fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to a country school house and my curiosity being excited by the monotonous hum of the students within i made bold to enter and creep along a crack between two boards until i reached the far end where in front of a hearth of glowing embers sat the master at his desk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one noticed so small a creature as a wogglebug and when i found that the hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine i resolved to establish my future home beside it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i found a charming nest between two bricks and hid myself therein for many many months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor nowitall is doubtless the most famous scholar in the land of oz and after a few days i began to listen to the lectures and discourses he gave his pupils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not one of them was more attentive than the humble unnoticed wogglebug and i acquired in this way a fund of knowledge that i will myself confess is simply marvelous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thoroughly educated upon my cards for my greatest pride lies in the fact that the world cannot produce another wogglebug with a tenth part of my own culture and erudition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not blame you said the scarecrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having heard this story dorothy related to them her own adventures and then went out with her friends to find the sawhorse which ozma had caused to be shod with plates of gold so that its legs would not wear out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came upon the sawhorse standing motionless beside the garden gate but when dorothy was introduced to him he bowed politely and blinked his eyes which were knots of wood and wagged his tail which was only the branch of a tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i quiet agree with you replied the sawhorse in a rough but not unpleasant voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a creature like me has no business to live as we all know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was the magic powder that did it so i cannot justly be blamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you seem to be of some use cause i noticed the scarecrow riding upon your back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes im of use returned the sawhorse and i never tire never have to be fed or cared for in any way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be foolish to waste intelligence on a common sawhorse when so many professors need it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i know enough to obey my masters and to giddup or whoa when im told to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night dorothy slept in a pleasant little bedchamber next to that occupied by ozma of oz and billina perched upon the foot of the bed and tucked her head under her wing and slept as soundly in that position as did dorothy upon her soft cushions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before daybreak every one was awake and stirring and soon the adventurers were eating a hasty breakfast in the great diningroom of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ozma sat at the head of a long table on a raised platform with dorothy on her right hand and the scarecrow on her left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scarecrow did not eat of course but ozma placed him near her so that she might ask his advice about the journey while she ate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lower down the table were the twentyseven warriors of oz and at the end of the room the lion and the tiger were eating out of a kettle that had been placed upon the floor while billina fluttered around to pick up any scraps that might be scattered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did not take long to finish the meal and then the lion and the tiger were harnessed to the chariot and the party was ready to start for the nome kings palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first rode ozma with dorothy beside her in the golden chariot and holding billina fast in her arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came the scarecrow on the sawhorse with the tin woodman and tiktok marching side by side just behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after these tramped the army looking brave and handsome in their splendid uniforms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the generals commanded the colonels and the colonels commanded the majors and the majors commanded the captains and the captains commanded the private who marched with an air of proud importance because it required so many officers to give him his orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so the magnificent procession left the palace and started along the road just as day was breaking and by the time the sun came out they had made good progress toward the valley that led to the nome kings domain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the road led for a time through a pretty farm country and then past a picnic grove that was very inviting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ozma stopped her chariot so suddenly that the scarecrows sawhorse nearly ran into it and the ranks of the army tumbled over one another before they could come to a halt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately the yellow hen struggled from dorothys arms and flew into a clump of bushes by the roadside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why billina wants to lay her egg thats all said dorothy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he expressed his pleasure in knowing an artist with whose work he was so familiar and congratulated himself on the happy accident which had brought them both to the same hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have more than a natural interest in meeting you said the prince and for a reason which you may or may not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought possibly you could help me somewhat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have within the past few days come into the possession of two of your paintings they are studies rather but to me they are even more desirable than the finished work and i am not correct in saying that they have come to me exactly but to my sister the princess aline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carlton could not withhold a certain start of surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not expected that his gift would so soon have arrived but his face showed only polite attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the studies were delivered to us in london continued the duke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are of ludwig the tragedian and of the german prime minister two most valuable works and especially interesting to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came without any note or message which would inform us who had sent them and when my people made inquiries the dealer refused to tell them from whom they had come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been ordered to forward them to grasse but on learning of our presence in london sent them direct to our hotel there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it is embarrassing to have so valuable a present from an anonymous friend especially so for my sister to whom they were addressed and i thought that besides the pleasure of meeting one of whose genius i am so warm an admirer i might also learn something which would enable me to discover who our friend may be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused but as carlton said nothing continued as it is now i do not feel that i can accept the pictures and yet i know no one to whom they can be returned unless i send them to the dealer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it sounds very mysterious said carlton smiling and i am afraid i cannot help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what work i did in germany was sold in berlin before i left and in a year may have changed hands several times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the studies of which you speak are unimportant and merely studies and could pass from hand to hand without much record having been kept of them but personally i am not able to give you any information which would assist you in tracing them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then i shall keep them until i can learn more and if we can learn nothing i shall return them to the dealer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carlton met miss morris that afternoon in a state of great excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the superfluity had become a necessity and knight was in love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stephen fell in love with elfride by looking at her knight by ceasing to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when or how the spirit entered into him he knew not certain he was that when on the point of leaving endelstow he had felt none of that exquisite nicety of poignant sadness natural to such severances seeing how delightful a subject of contemplation elfride had been ever since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he begun to love her when she met his eye after her mishap on the tower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he grown to love her whilst standing on the lawn brightened all over by the evening sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had thought her complexion good no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it her conversation that had sown the seed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had thought her words ingenious and very creditable to a young woman but not noteworthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had the chess playing anything to do with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly not he had thought her at that time a rather conceited child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knights experience was a complete disproof of the assumption that love always comes by glances of the eye and sympathetic touches of the fingers that like flame it makes itself palpable at the moment of generation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not till they were parted and she had become sublimated in his memory could he be said to have even attentively regarded her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus having passively gathered up images of her which his mind did not act upon till the cause of them was no longer before him he appeared to himself to have fallen in love with her soul which had temporarily assumed its disembodiment to accompany him on his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she began to rule him so imperiously now that accustomed to analysis he almost trembled at the possible result of the introduction of this new force among the nicely adjusted ones of his ordinary life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he became restless then he forgot all collateral subjects in the pleasure of thinking about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet it must be said that knight loved philosophically rather than with romance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no forcible translation of favour into suspicion was able to uphold such a theory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the performance had been too well done to be anything but real <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had the defects without which nothing is genuine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no actress of twenty years standing no baldnecked lady whose earliest season out was lost in the discreet mist of evasive talk could have played before him the part of ingenuous girl as elfride lived it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had the little artful ways which partly make up ingenuousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are bachelors by nature and bachelors by circumstance spinsters there doubtless are also of both kinds though some think only those of the latter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however knight had been looked upon as a bachelor by nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was very odd to himself to look at his theories on the subject of love and reading them now by the full light of a new experience to see how much more his sentences meant than he had felt them to mean when they were written <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people often discover the real force of a trite old maxim only when it is thrust upon them by a chance adventure but knight had never before known the case of a man who learnt the full compass of his own epigrams by such means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was intensely satisfied with one aspect of the affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inbred in him was an invincible objection to be any but the first comer in a womans heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had discovered within himself the condition that if ever he did make up his mind to marry it must be on the certainty that no cropping out of inconvenient old letters no bow and blush to a mysterious stranger casually met should be a possible source of discomposure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knights sentiments were only the ordinary ones of a man of his age who loves genuinely perhaps exaggerated a little by his pursuits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when men first love as lads it is with the very centre of their hearts nothing else being concerned in the operation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with added years more of the faculties attempt a partnership in the passion till at knights age the understanding is fain to have a hand in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man in love setting up his brains as a gauge of his position is as one determining a ships longitude from a light at the masthead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knight argued from elfrides unwontedness of manner which was matter of fact to an unwontedness in love which was matter of inference only <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elfride he he had never forgotten his severity to her because she preferred ornament to edification and had since excused her a hundred times by thinking how natural to womankind was a love of adornment and how necessary became a mild infusion of personal vanity to complete the delicate and fascinating dye of the feminine mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so at the end of the weeks absence which had brought him as far as dublin he resolved to curtail his tour return to endelstow and commit himself by making a reality of the hypothetical offer of that sunday evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> notwithstanding that he had concocted a great deal of paper theory on social amenities and modern manners generally the special ounce of practice was wanting and now for his life knight could not recollect whether it was considered correct to give a young lady personal ornaments before a regular engagement to marry had been initiated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the day before leaving dublin he looked around anxiously for a highclass jewellery establishment in which he purchased what he considered would suit her best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with a most awkward and unwonted feeling that after entering and closing the door of his room he sat down opened the morocco case and held up each of the fragile bits of goldwork before his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many things had become old to the solitary man of letters but these were new and he handled like a child an outcome of civilization which had never before been touched by his fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sudden fastidious decision that the pattern chosen would not suit her after all caused him to rise in a flurry and tear down the street to change them for others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a great deal of trouble in reselecting during which his mind became so bewildered that the critical faculty on objects of art seemed to have vacated his person altogether knight carried off another pair of earrings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these remained in his possession till the afternoon when after contemplating them fifty times with a growing misgiving that the last choice was worse than the first he felt that no sleep would visit his pillow till he had improved upon his previous purchases yet again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a perfect heat of vexation with himself for such tergiversation he went anew to the shopdoor was absolutely ashamed to enter and give further trouble went to another shop bought a pair at an enormously increased price because they seemed the very thing asked the goldsmiths if they would take the other pair in exchange was told that they could not exchange articles bought of another maker paid down the money and went off with the two pairs in his possession wondering what on earth to do with the superfluous pair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he almost wished he could lose them or that somebody would steal them and was burdened with an interposing sense that as a capable man with true ideas of economy he must necessarily sell them somewhere which he did at last for a mere song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mingled with a blank feeling of a whole day being lost to him in running about the city on this new and extraordinary class of errand and of several pounds being lost through his bungling was a slight sense of satisfaction that he had emerged for ever from his antediluvian ignorance on the subject of ladies jewellery as well as secured a truly artistic production at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the remainder of that day he scanned the ornaments of every lady he met with the profoundly experienced eye of an appraiser <end> <end>

<start> <start> womans ruling passionto fascinate and influence those more powerful than shethough operant in elfride was decidedly purposeless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had wanted her friend knights good opinion from the first how much more than that elementary ingredient of friendship she now desired her fears would hardly allow her to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in originally wishing to please the highest class of man she had ever intimately known there was no disloyalty to stephen smith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could notand few women canrealize the possible vastness of an issue which has only an insignificant begetting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her letters from stephen were necessarily few and her sense of fidelity clung to the last she had received as a wrecked mariner clings to flotsam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young girl persuaded herself that she was glad stephen had such a right to her hand as he had acquired in her eyes by the elopement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she beguiled herself by saying perhaps if i had not so committed myself i might fall in love all this made the week of knights absence very gloomy and distasteful to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she retained stephen in her prayers and his old letters were rereadas a medicine in reality though she deceived herself into the belief that it was as a pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these letters had grown more and more hopeful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told her that he finished his work every day with a pleasant consciousness of having removed one more stone from the barrier which divided them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he drew images of what a fine figure they two would cut some day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people would turn their heads and say what a prize he has won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not to be sad about that wild runaway attempt of theirs elfride had repeatedly said that it grieved her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever any other person who knew of it might think he knew well enough the modesty of her nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only reproach was a gentle one for not having written quite so devotedly during her visit to london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her letter had seemed to have a liveliness derived from other thoughts than thoughts of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knights intention of an early return to endelstow having originally been faint his promise to do so had been fainter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a man who kept his words well to the rear of his possible actions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vicar was rather surprised to see him again so soon mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knight found on meeting them all after his arrival had been announced that they had formed an intention to go to st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leonards for a few days at the end of the month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no satisfactory conjuncture offered itself on this first evening of his return for presenting elfride with what he had been at such pains to procure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was fastidious in his reading of opportunities for such an intended act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning chancing to break fine after a week of cloudy weather it was proposed and decided that they should all drive to barwith strand a local lion which neither mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knight scented romantic occasions from afar and foresaw that such a one might be expected before the coming night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the journey was along a road by neutral green hills upon which hedgerows lay trailing like ropes on a quay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gaps in these uplands revealed the blue sea flecked with a few dashes of white and a solitary white sail the whole brimming up to a keen horizon which lay like a line ruled from hillside to hillside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they rolled down a pass the chocolatetoned rocks forming a wall on both sides from one of which fell a heavy jagged shade over half the roadway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a spout of fresh water burst from an occasional crevice and pattering down upon broad green leaves ran along as a rivulet at the bottom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unkempt locks of heather overhung the brow of each steep whence at divers points a bramble swung forth into midair snatching at their headdresses like a claw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they mounted the last crest and the bay which was to be the end of their pilgrimage burst upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ocean blueness deepened its colour as it stretched to the foot of the crags where it terminated in a fringe of whitesilent at this distance though moving and heaving like a counterpane upon a restless sleeper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shadowed hollows of the purple and brown rocks would have been called blue had not that tint been so entirely appropriated by the water beside them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the carriage was put up at a little cottage with a shed attached and an ostler and the coachman carried the hamper of provisions down to the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not forget your wish he began when they were apart from their friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elfride looked as if she did not understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i have brought you these he continued awkwardly pulling out the case and opening it while holding it towards her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said elfride confusedly and turning to a lively red i didnt know you had any intention or meaning in what you a thought which had flashed into her mind gave the reply a greater decisiveness than it might otherwise have possessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knight returned feeling less her master than heretofore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are beautifulmore beautiful than any i have ever seen she answered earnestly looking halfwishfully at the temptation as eve may have looked at the apple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont want to have them if you will kindly forgive me mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knight brought to a full stop at this unexpected turn of events <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knight held the open case looking rather wofully at the glittering forms he had forsaken his orbit to procure turning it about and holding it up as if feeling his gift to be slighted by her he were endeavouring to admire it very much himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shut them up and dont let me see them any longerdo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said laughingly and with a quaint mixture of reluctance and entreaty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there i am silly i know to say that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have a reason for not taking themnow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she kept in the last word for a moment intending to imply that her refusal was finite but somehow the word slipped out and undid all the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have read a fact of distressing significance in that said knight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since you like them your dislike to having them must be elfride deepened in tint and looked into the distance with features shaped to an expression of the nicest criticism as regarded her answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like you pretty well she at length murmured mildly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are so sharp with me and say hard things and so how can i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i donti mean i doi dont know what i think you i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us go to papa responded elfride with somewhat of a flurried delivery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill tell you my object in getting the present said knight with a composure intended to remove from her mind any possible impression of his being what he washer lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see elfride felt rather blank at this lucid statement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do not answer me ingenuously replied the queen i am satisfied of the contrary the free manner in which i speak to you ought to oblige you to conceal nothing from me i would have you continued she be of the number of my friends but i would not after having admitted you into that rank be ignorant of your engagements consider whether you think my friendship will be too dear at the price of making me your confidant i give you two days to think on it but then consider well of the answer you shall make me and remember that if ever i find hereafter you having said this the queen left me without waiting for my answer you may imagine how full my thoughts were of what she had said to me the two days she had given me to consider of it i did not think too long a time to come to a resolution i found she had a mind to know if i was in love and that her desire was i should not be so i foresaw the consequences of what i was going to do my vanity was flattered with the thought of having a particular interest with the queen and a queen whose person is still extremely amiable on the other hand i was in love with madam de themines and though i had committed a petty treason against her by my engagement with the other woman i told you of i could not find in my heart to break with her i foresaw also the danger i should expose myself to if i deceived the queen and how hard it would be to do it nevertheless i could not resolve to refuse what fortune offered me and was willing to run the hazard of anything my ill conduct might draw upon me i broke with her with whom i kept a correspondence that might be discovered and was in hopes of concealing that i had with madam de themines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the two days end as i entered the room where the queen was with all the ladies about her she said aloud to me and with a grave air that was surprising enough have you thought of the business i charged you with and do you know the truth of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes madam answered i and tis as i told your majesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come in the evening when i am writing replied she and you shall have further orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made a respectful bow without answering anything and did not fail to attend at the hour she had appointed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found her in the gallery with her secretary and one of her women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as she saw me she came to me and took me to the other end of the gallery well says she after having considered thoroughly of this matter have you nothing to say to me and as to my manner of treating you does not it deserve that you should deal sincerely with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is madam answered i because i deal sincerely that i have nothing more to say and i swear to your majesty with all the respect i owe you that i have no engagement with any woman of the court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will believe it replied the queen because i wish it and i wish it because i desire to have you entirely mine and because it would be impossible for me to be satisfied with your friendship if you were in love one cannot confide in those who are one cannot be secure of their secrecy they are too much divided and their mistresses have always the first place in their thoughts which does not suit at all with the manner in which i would have you live with me remember then it is upon your giving me your word that you have no engagement that i choose you for my confidant remember i insist on having you entirely to myself and that you shall have no friend of either sex but such as i shall approve and that you abandon every care but that of pleasing me ill not desire you to neglect any opportunity for advancing your fortune ill conduct your interests with more application than you can yourself and whatever i do for you i shall think myself more than recompensed if you answer my expectations i make choice of you to open my hearts griefs to you and to have your assistance in softening them you may imagine they are not small i bear in appearance without much concern the kings engagement with the duchess of valentinois but it is insupportable to me she governs the king she imposes upon him she slights me all my people are at her beck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queen my daughterinlaw proud of her beauty and the authority of her uncles pays me no respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the constable montmorency is master of the king and kingdom he hates me and has given proofs of his hatred which i shall never forget <end> <end> 
<start> <start> andre is a bold young favourite who uses me no better than the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the detail of my misfortunes would move your pity hitherto i have not dared to confide in anybody i confide in you take care that i never repent it and be my only consolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queen blushed when she had ended this discourse and i was so truly touched with the goodness she had expressed to me that i was going to throw myself at her feet from that day she has placed an entire confidence in me she has done nothing without advising with me and the intimacy and union between us still subsists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime however busy and full i was of my new engagement with the queen i still kept fair with madam de themines by a natural inclination which it was not in my power to conquer i thought she cooled in her love to me and whereas had i been prudent i should have made use of the change i observed in her for my cure my love redoubled upon it and i managed so ill that the queen got some knowledge of this intrigue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the name recurs frequently in our history and is generally to be found in a prominent place whenever periods of tumult or of peril called forth the courage and the enterprise of this country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the storm of confiscation which swept over the land made woeful havoc in their broad domains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some fragments of property however did remain to them and with it the building which had for ages formed the family residence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about the year my uncle a catholic priest became acquainted with the inmates of castle connor and after a time introduced me then a lad of about fifteen full of spirits and little dreaming that a profession so grave as his should ever become mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the family at that time consisted of but two members a widow lady and her only son a young man aged about eighteen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in our early days the progress from acquaintance to intimacy and from intimacy to friendship is proverbially rapid and young oconnor and i became in less than a month close and confidential companions an intercourse which ripened gradually into an attachment ardent deep and devoted such as i believe young hearts only are capable of forming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been left early fatherless and the representative and heir of his family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mothers affection for him was intense in proportion as there existed no other object to divide itindeedsuch love as that she bore him i have never seen elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her love was better bestowed than that of mothers generally is for young oconnor not without some of the faults had certainly many of the most engaging qualities of youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had all the frankness and gaiety which attract and the generosity of heart which confirms friendship indeed i never saw a person so universally popular his very faults seemed to recommend him he was wild extravagant thoughtless and fearlessly adventurousdefects of character which among the peasantry of ireland are honoured as virtues <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the combination of these qualities and the position which oconnor occupied as representative of an ancient irish catholic familya peculiarly interesting one to me one of the old faith endeared him to me so much that i have never felt the pangs of parting more keenly than when it became necessary for the finishing of his education that he should go abroad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three years had passed away before i saw him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the interval however i had frequently heard from him so that absence had not abated the warmth of our attachment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who could tell of the rejoicings that marked the evening of his return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the horses were removed from the chaise at the distance of a mile from the castle while it and its contents were borne rapidly onward almost by the pressure of the multitude like a log upon a torrent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bonfires blared far and near bagpipes roared and fiddles squeaked and amid the thundering shouts of thousands the carriage drew up before the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant young oconnor was upon the ground crying thank you boys thank you boys while a thousand hands were stretched out from all sides to grasp even a finger of his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still amid shouts of god bless your honourlong may you reign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reached the threshold of the castle where stood his mother weeping for joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who could describe that embrace or the enthusiasm with which it was witnessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god bless him to you my lady glory to ye both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and oh but he is a fine young gentleman god bless him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> resounded on all sides while hats flew up in volleys that darkened the moon and when at length amid the broad delighted grins of the thronging domestics whose sense of decorum precluded any more boisterous evidence of joy they reached the parlour then giving way to the fulness of her joy the widowed mother kissed and blessed him and wept in turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young omaras reflections were more agitating and less satisfactory than those of his companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolved upon leaving the country before two days had passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt that he could not fairly seek to involve ellen heathcote in his fate by pledge or promise until he had extricated himself from those trammels which constrained and embarrassed all his actions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his determination was so far prudent but alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he also resolved that it was but right but necessary that he should see her before his departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his leaving the country without a look or a word of parting kindness interchanged must to her appear an act of cold and heartless caprice he could not bear the thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said he i am not child enough to say more than prudence tells me ought to say this cowardly distrust of my firmness i should and will contemn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is possible the girl may not care for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no i need not shrink from this interview <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no reason to doubt my firmness nonenone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must cease to be governed by impulse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am involved in rocks and quicksands and a collected spirit a quick eye and a steady hand alone can pilot me through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god grant me a safe the next day came and young omara did not take his fishingrod as usual but wrote two letters the one to his father announcing his intention of departing speedily for england the other to lady emily containing a cold but courteous apology for his apparent neglect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both these were despatched to the postoffice that evening and upon the next morning he was to leave the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the night of the momentous day of which we have just spoken ellen heathcote glided silently and unperceived from among the busy crowds who were engaged in the gay dissipation furnished by what is in ireland commonly called a dance the expenses attendant upon which music etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are defrayed by a subscription of one halfpenny each and having drawn her mantle closely about her was proceeding with quick steps to traverse the small field which separated her from her fathers abode <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not walked many yards when she became aware that a solitary figure muffled in a cloak stood in the pathway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it approached a low voice is it you master richard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he threw back the cloak which had concealed his features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is i ellen he said i have been watching for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not delay you he took her hand and she did not attempt to withdraw it for she was too artless to think any evil too confiding to dread it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ellen he continued even now unconsciously departing from the rigid course which prudence had marked out ellen i am going to leave the country going tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must go and the sea will soon he paused and she was silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is one request one entreaty i have to make he continued i would when i am far away have something to look at which belonged to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i therefore lay quiet going forth from my lodgings but little and that chiefly under cover of the dusk and conversing hardly at all except with those whom i well knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had like once to have paid dearly for relaxing this caution for going into a tavern one evening near the tholsel i had the confidence to throw off my hat and sit there with my face quite exposed when a fellow coming in with some troopers they fell aboozing and being somewhat warmed they began to drink confusion to popery and the like and to compel the peaceable persons who happened to sit there to join them in so doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though i was rather hotblooded i was resolved to say nothing to attract notice but at the same time if urged to pledge the toasts which they were compelling others to drink to resist doing so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the intent to withdraw myself quietly from the place i paid my reckoning and putting on my hat was going into the street when the countryman who had come in with the soldiers called and running across the room he got to the door before me and shutting it placed his back against it to prevent my going out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though with much difficulty i kept an appearance of quietness and turning to the fellow who from his accent i judged to be northern and whose face i knew though to this day i cannot say where i had seen him beforei observed very sir i came in here with no other design than to refresh myself without offending any man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have paid my reckoning and now desire to go forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there is anything within reason that i can do to satisfy you and to prevent trouble and delay to myself name your terms and if they be but fair i will frankly comply you are hardress fitzgerald the bloody popish captain that hanged the i felt that i was in some danger but being a strong man and used to perils of all kinds it was not easy to disconcert me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked then steadily at the fellow and in a voice of much confidence i i am neither a papist a royalist nor a fitzgerald but an honester protestant mayhap than many who make louder then drink the honest mans toast said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damnation to the pope and confusion to skulking jimmy and his yourself shall hear me said i taking the largest pewter pot that lay within my reach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tapster fill this with ale i grieve i took the vessel of liquor in my hand and walking up to him i first made a bow to the troopers who sat laughing at the sprightliness of their facetious friend and then another to himself when saying g damn yourself and your cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i flung the ale straight into his face and before he had time to recover himself i struck him with my whole force and weight with the pewter pot upon the head so strong a blow that he fell for aught i know dead upon the floor and nothing but the handle of the vessel remained in my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i opened the door but one of the dragoons drew his sabre and ran at me to avenge his companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with my hand i put aside the blade of the sword narrowly escaping what he had intended for me the point actually tearing open my vest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mos four oclock and dat sundayschoolroom aint ready yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hasty picked up the empty box and the step ladder and went out through the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had barely disappeared when a peal of laughter was heard from the hillside and before mandy could get out of the way the youngsters came tumbling down the path again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lawsy lawsy she gasped as polly circled around her dodging the children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polly cried as she touched the widows auburnhaired offspring on the sleeve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was much wailing when willie passed the tag to little jennie the smallest girl in the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont play no more she sobbed cause is always it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to comfort her polly began to sing an old circus song that the children had learned to love and the little ones huddled about her in a circle to hear of the wonderful van amberg who used to walk right into the lions cage and put his head in the lions mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children were in a state of nerves that did credit to polly as an entertainer when hasty broke in upon the song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you get a minute i want ter tell yer somethin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and turning to the eager mites at her side polly told them to run along into the grove and that shed come pretty soon to teach them a new game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the youngsters went screaming and laughing on their way and she breathed a sigh of relief as she threw herself down on the rustic seat that encircled the elm tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked suspecting that he was in trouble with mandy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its bout de circus hasty informed her bluntly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its in wakefielden nex month its acomin here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought youd want ter know said hasty little surprised at her lack of enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned away and pretended to look at the flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> don yous tell mandy i been talkin bout dat circus said hasty uneasily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was beginning to fear that he had made a mistake but before polly could answer mandy came out of the house carrying baskets and food which hasty was to take to the sundayschoolroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at the girls troubled face and drooping shoulders in surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> don you look fine in your new dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was anxious to draw the girl out of her reverie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polly asked eagerly forgetting her depression of a moment before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he nebber takes no notice ob dem things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i done got a bran spankin new allapaca one time an do you think he ebber seed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we might jes well be goin roun like mudder eve for all dat man know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but udder folks sees mandy continued comfortingly an you certainly look mighty fine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why yous just as good now as you was afore you got hurled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes im well now and able to work again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no enthusiasm in her tone for hastys news had made her realise how unwelcome the old life would be to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when after a time i saw in the distance what i took to be huts in a clearing near the shore i drew quickly into land for though i had been furnished credentials by kolk i was not sufficiently familiar with the tribal characteristics of these people to know whether i should receive a friendly welcome or not and in case i should not i wanted to be sure of having a canoe hidden safely away so that i might undertake the trip to the island in any eventprovided of course that i escaped the thurians should they prove bellig erent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the point where i landed the shore was quite low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a forest of pale scrubby ferns ran down almost to the beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here i dragged up the dugout hiding it well within the vegetation and with some loose rocks built a cairn upon the beach to mark my cache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i turned my steps toward the thurian village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i proceeded i began to speculate upon the possible actions of raja when we should enter the presence of other men than myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brute was padding softly at my side his sensitive nose constantly atwitch and his fierce eyes moving restlessly from side to sidenothing would ever take raja unawares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more i thought upon the matter the greater be came my perturbation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not want raja to attack any of the people upon whose friendship i so greatly depended nor did i want him injured or slain by them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered if raja would stand for a leash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his head as he paced beside me was level with my hip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i did so he turned and looked up into my face his jaws parting and his red tongue lolling as you have seen your own dogs beneath a love pat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just been waiting all your life to be tamed and loved havent you old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre nothing but a good pup and the man who put the hyaeno in your name ought to be sued for libel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raja bared his mighty fangs with upcurled snarling lips and licked my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill bet a doughnut youre nothing but some kids poor old fido masquerading around as a real live maneater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so we walked on together toward thuriai talking to the beast at my side and he seem ing to enjoy my company no less than i enjoyed his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont think its lonesome wandering all by yourself through savage unknown pellucidar why just try it and you will not wonder that i was glad of the company of this first dogthis living replica of the fierce and now extinct hyaenodon of the outer crust that hunted in savage packs the great elk across the snows of southern france in the days when the mastodon roamed at will over the broad continent of which the british isles were then a part and perchance left his footprints and his bones in the sands of atlantis as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus i dreamed as we moved on toward thuria <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dreaming was rudely shattered by a savage growl from raja <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had stopped in his tracks as one turned to stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a thin ridge of stiff hair bristled along the entire length of his spine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his yel low green eyes were fastened upon the scrubby jungle at our right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fastened my fingers in the bristles at his neck and turned my eyes in the direction that his pointed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a slight movement of the bushes riveted my attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it must be some wild beast and was glad of the primitive weapons i had taken from the bodies of the warriors who had attacked me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently i distinguished two eyes peering at us from the vegetation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took a step in their direction and as i did so a youth arose and fled precipitately in the direction we had been going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raja struggled to be after him but i held tightly to his neck an act which he did not seem to relish for he turned on me with bared fangs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i determined that now was as good a time as any to discover just how deep was rajas affection for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of us could be master and logically i was the one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked it me for a moment in surprised bewilderment and then he growled again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made another feint at him expecting that it would bring him at my throat but in stead he winced and crouched down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i took a piece of the rope that constituted a part of my equipment and made a leash for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the youth who had seen us was evidently of the thurians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he had lost no time in racing homeward and spreading the word of my coming was evidenced when we had come within sight of the clearing and the village the first real village by the way that i had ever seen constructed by human pellucidarians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a rude rectangle walled with logs and boulders in which were a hundred or more thatched huts of similar con struction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ladders that could be re moved by night led over the palisade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the village were assembled a great concourse of warriors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inside i could see the heads of women and children peering over the top of the wall and also farther back the long necks of lidi topped by their tiny heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lidi by the way is both the singular and plural form of the noun that describes the huge beasts of bur den of the thurians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are enormous quadrupeds eighty or a hundred feet long with very small heads perched at the top of very long slender necks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their heads are quite forty feet from the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their gait is slow and deliberate but so enormous are their strides that as a matter of fact they cover the ground quite rapidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perry has told me that they are almost identical with the fossilized remains of the diplodocus of the outer crusts jurassic age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have to take his word for itand i guess you will unless you know more of such matters than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we came in sight of the warriors the men set up a great jabbering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the breakfastroom chimney smokes a little i grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard which may not happen three times a winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and take it altogether now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is not one that we like better than this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present for when it was returned the crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall or of seeing him in company with her friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything was safe enough and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr and mrs musgroves going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross they drove over to the lodge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had left louisa beginning to sit up but her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home and her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs musgrove had got mrs harvilles children away as much as she could every possible supply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience to the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and when they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maidservant to wait and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence but then she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much going on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles and she had got books from the library and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been taken to charmouth too and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anne enquired after captain benwick marys face was clouded directly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain benwick is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know what he would be at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we asked him to come home with us for a day or two charles undertook to give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part i thought it was all settled when behold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had been quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heartbroken man as captain benwick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charles laughed again and said now mary you know very well how it really was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all your doing turning to anne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not courage to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the fact upon my honour mary knows it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must be left to be guessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annes goodwill however was not to be lessened by what she heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he talks of you cried charles in such terms mary interrupted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i declare anne he never talks of you at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinksoh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very finei overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no end of miss elliots charms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his credit if he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure you will agree with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you maam said charles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the churchs being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any acquaintance of annes will always be welcome to me was lady russells kind answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to being annes acquaintance said mary i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you maam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is not at all a wellbred young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure you will not like him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure lady russell would like him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give him a book and he will read all day long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drops ones scissors or anything that happens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard nothing said starkey raising the lantern over the waters and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the nest i have told you of floating on the lagoon and the never bird was sitting on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see said hook in answer to smees question that is a mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nest must have fallen into the water but would the mother desert her eggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a break in his voice as if for a moment he recalled innocent days when but he brushed away this weakness with his hook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> smee much impressed gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past but the more suspicious starkey said if she is a mother perhaps she is hanging about here to help peter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay he said that is the fear that haunts me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was roused from this dejection by smees eager voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain said smee could we not kidnap these boys mother and make her our mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a princely scheme cried hook and at once it took practical shape in his great brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will seize the children and carry them to the boat the boys we will make walk the plank and wendy shall be our mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they thought it must have been a leaf in the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is my hand on it they both said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time they were on the rock and suddenly hook remembered tiger lily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a playful humour at moments and they thought this was one of the moments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is all right captain smee answered complacently we let her go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you called over the water to us to let her go said starkey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brimstone and gall thundered hook what cozening cheating is going on here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face had gone black with rage but he saw that they believed their words and he was startled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lads he said shaking a little i gave no such order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is passing queer smee said and they all fidgeted uncomfortably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hook raised his voice but there was a quiver in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> spirit that haunts this dark lagoon tonight he cried dost hear me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course peter should have kept quiet but of course he did odds bobs hammer and tongs i hear you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that supreme moment hook did not blanch even at the gills but smee and starkey clung to each other in terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am james hook replied the voice captain of the jolly roger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not you are not hook cried hoarsely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brimstone and gall the voice retorted say that again and ill cast anchor in you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are hook he said almost humbly come tell me who am i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a codfish replied the voice only a codfish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hook echoed blankly and it was then but not till then that his proud spirit broke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw his men draw back from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have we been captained all this time by a codfish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were his dogs snapping at him but tragic figure though he had become he scarcely heeded them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in him that he needed it was his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont desert me bully he whispered hoarsely to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine as in all the great pirates and it sometimes gave him intuitions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now peter could never resist a game and he answered blithely in his own voice i have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assured myself as i walked home that if veil there was i should tomorrow find an eyelet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ones intuition when it is off duty seems always a much more powerful engine than it does on active service and next day at sight of pethel awaiting me outside his hotel i became less confident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his thought i was a face which for all its animation would tell nothingnothing at any rate that mattered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it expressed well enough that he was pleased to see me but for the rest i was reminded that it had a sort of frank inscrutability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides it was at all points so very usual a facea face that couldnt so i then thought even if it had leave to betray connection with a great character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a strong face certainly but so are yours and mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and very fresh it looked though as he confessed pethel had sat up in that beastly baccaratroom till five am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he had lost steadily for four hours proudly he laid stress on this but in the endwell he had won it all back and a bit more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day after she heard the news she was in dreadful woe but the next she came to herself very quiet and took the horse and wagon and drove fourteen miles to the lawyers and signed a paper givin her half of the farm to her brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they never had got along very well together but he didnt want to sign it till she acted so distressed that he gave in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edward todds wife was a good woman who felt very bad indeed and used every argument with joanna but joanna took a poor old boat that had been her fathers and loded in a few things and off she put all alone with a good land breeze right out to sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edward todd ran down to the beach an stood there cryin like a boy to see her go but she was out o hearin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she never stepped foot on the mainland again long as she lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps thirty acres rocks and all answered mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there cant be much of it that the salt spray dont fly over in storms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no tis a dreadful small place to make a world of it has a different look from any of the other islands but theres a sheltered cove on the south side with mudflats across one end of it at low water where theres excellent clams and the big shellheap keeps some o the wind off a little house her father took the trouble to build when he was a young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they said there was an old house built o logs there before that with a kind of natural cellar in the rock under it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he used to stay out there days to a time and anchor a little sloop he had and dig clams to fill it and sail up to portland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they said the dealers always gave him an extra price the clams were so noted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joanna used to go out and stay with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were always great companions so she knew just what twas out there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a few sheep that belonged to her brother an her but she bargained for him to come and get them on the edge o cold weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she desired him to come for the sheep an his wife thought perhaps joannad return but he said no an loded the bot with warm things an what he thought shed need through the winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he come home with the sheep an left the other things by the house but she never so much as looked out o the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must have wanted to see edward by that time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some thought the first cold snap would set her ashore but she always remained concluded mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> talk about the men not having any curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the waters round shellheap island were white with sails all that fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twas never called no great of a fishinground before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many of em made excuse to go ashore to get water at the spring but at last she spoke to a botload very dignified and calm and said that shed like it better if theyd make a practice of getting water to black island or somewheres else and leave her alone except in case of accident or trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was one man who had always set everything by her from a boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hed have married her if the other hadnt come about an spoilt his chance and he used to get close to the island before light on his way out fishin and throw a little bundle way up the green slope front o the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his sister told me she happened to see the first time what a pretty choice he made o useful things that a woman would feel lost without <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood off fishin and could see them in the grass all day though sometimes shed come out and walk right by them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was other bots near out after mackerel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but early next morning his present was gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he didnt presume too much but once he took her a nice firkin o things he got up to portland and when spring come he landed her a hen and chickens in a nice little coop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a good many old friends had joanna on their minds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> todd losing her sad reserve in the growing sympathy of these reminiscences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how everybody used to notice whether there was smoke out of the chimney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the black island folks could see her with their spyglass and if theyd ever missed getting some sign o life theyd have sent notice to her folks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after the first year or two joanna was more and more forgotten as an everyday charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> folks lived very simple in those days you know she continued as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fosdicks knitting was taking much thought at the moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i expect there was always plenty of driftwood thrown up and a poor failin patch of spruces covered all the north side of the island so she always had something to burn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had carried with her all the strangeness of the reflected room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had sunk to the level of the one without <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when the first pangs of his disappointment had passed cosmo began to comfort himself with the hope that she might return perhaps the next evening at the same hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> resolving that if she did she should not at least be scared by the hateful skeleton he removed that and several other articles of questionable appearance into a recess by the side of the hearth whence they could not possibly cast any reflection into the mirror and having made his poor room as tidy as he could sought the solace of the open sky and of a night wind that had begun to blow for he could not rest where he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he returned somewhat composed he could hardly prevail with himself to lie down on his bed for he could not help feeling as if she had lain upon it and for him to lie there now would be something like sacrilege <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however weariness prevailed and laying himself on the couch dressed as he was he slept till day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a beating heart beating till he could hardly breathe he stood in dumb hope before the mirror on the following evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again the reflected room shone as through a purple vapour in the gathering twilight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything seemed waiting like himself for a coming splendour to glorify its poor earthliness with the presence of a heavenly joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and just as the room vibrated with the strokes of the neighbouring church bell announcing the hour of six in glided the pale beauty and again laid herself on the couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor cosmo nearly lost his senses with delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes sought the corner where the skeleton had stood and a faint gleam of satisfaction crossed her face apparently at seeing it empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked suffering still but there was less of discomfort expressed in her countenance than there had been the night before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took more notice of the things about her and seemed to gaze with some curiosity on the strange apparatus standing here and there in her room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length however drowsiness seemed to overtake her and again she fell asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> resolved not to lose sight of her this time cosmo watched the sleeping form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her slumber was so deep and absorbing that a fascinating repose seemed to pass contagiously from her to him as he gazed upon her and he started as if from a dream when the lady moved and without opening her eyes rose and passed from the room with the gait of a somnambulist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cosmo was now in a state of extravagant delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the miser has his golden hoard the virtuoso his pet ring the student his rare book the poet his favourite haunt the lover his secret drawer but cosmo had a mirror with a lovely lady in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now that he knew by the skeleton that she was affected by the things around her he had a new object in life he would turn the bare chamber in the mirror into a room such as no lady need disdain to call her own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this he could effect only by furnishing and adorning his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet he possessed accomplishments that could be turned to account although hitherto he had preferred living on his slender allowance to increasing his means by what his pride considered unworthy of his rank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the best swordsman in the university and now he offered to give lessons in fencing and similar exercises to such as chose to pay him well for the trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his proposal was heard with surprise by the students but it was eagerly accepted by many and soon his instructions were not confined to the richer students but were anxiously sought by many of the young nobility of prague and its neighbourhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that very soon he had a good deal of money at his command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing he did was to remove his apparatus and oddities into a closet in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he placed his bed and a few other necessaries on each side of the hearth and parted them from the rest of the room by two screens of indian fabric <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he put an elegant couch for the lady to lie upon in the corner where his bed had formerly stood and by degrees every day adding some article of luxury converted it at length every night about the same time the lady entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first time she saw the new couch she started with a halfsmile then her face grew very sad the tears came to her eyes and she laid herself upon the couch and pressed her face into the silken cushions as if to hide from everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took notice of each addition and each change as the work proceeded and a look of acknowledgment as if she knew that some one was ministering to her and was grateful for it mingled with the constant look of suffering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length after she had lain down as usual one evening her eyes fell upon some paintings with which cosmo had just finished adorning the walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rose and to his great delight walked across the room and proceeded to examine them carefully testifying much pleasure in her looks as she did so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but again the sorrowful tearful expression returned and again she buried her face in the pillows of her couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gradually however her countenance had grown more composed much of the suffering manifest on her first appearance had vanished and a kind of quiet hopeful expression had taken its place which however frequently gave way to an anxious troubled look mingled with something of sympathetic pity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as might be expected in one of his temperament his interest had blossomed into love and his loveshall i call it ripened orwithered into passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not come near her could not speak to her could not hear a sound from those sweet lips to which his longing eyes would cling like bees to their i shall die for love of the maiden and ever he looked again and died not though his heart seemed ready to break with intensity of life and longing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the more he did for her the more he loved her and he hoped that although she never appeared to see him yet she was pleased to think that one unknown would give his life to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to comfort himself over his separation from her by thinking that perhaps some day she would see him and make signs to him and that would satisfy him for thought he is not this all that a loving soul can do to enter into communion with another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay how many who love never come nearer than to behold each other as in a mirror seem to know and yet never know the inward life never enter the other soul and part at last with but the vaguest notion of the universe on the borders of which they have been hovering for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could but speak to her and knew that she heard me i should be satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once he contemplated painting a picture on the wall which should of necessity convey to the lady a thought of himself but though he had some skill with the pencil he found his hand tremble so much when he began the attempt that he was forced to give it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who lives he dies who dies he is alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one evening as he stood gazing on his treasure he thought he saw a faint expression of selfconsciousness on her countenance as if she surmised that passionate eyes were fixed upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this grew till at last the red blood rose over her neck and cheek and brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cosmos longing to approach her became almost delirious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this night she was dressed in an evening costume resplendent with diamonds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this could add nothing to her beauty but it presented it in a new aspect enabled her loveliness to make a new manifestation of itself in a new embodiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for essential beauty is infinite and as the soul of nature needs an endless succession of varied forms to embody her loveliness countless faces of beauty springing forth not any two the same at any one of her heartthrobs so the individual form needs an infinite change of its environments to enable it to uncover all the phases of its loveliness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the singers attitude became more and more inexplicable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what you dont know is that when he gave it to me he said i give you back your liberty christine on condition that this ring is always on your finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as you keep it you will be protected against all danger and erik will remain your friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but woe to you if you ever part with it for erik will have his revenge!...my dear my dear the ring is gone!...woe to us both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they both looked for the ring but could not find it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was while i gave you that kiss up above under apollos lyre she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ring must have slipped from my finger and dropped into the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what misfortunes are in store for us now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us run away at once raoul insisted once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought that she was going to say yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she left him hurriedly still wringing and rubbing her fingers as though she hoped to bring the ring back like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raoul went home greatly perturbed at all that he had heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two page color illustration if i dont save her from the hands of that humbug he said aloud as he went to bed she is lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put out his lamp and felt a need to insult erik in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know exactly where we shall find the bones too robert went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see that dark arch just along the passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well just if you dont stop going on like that said jane firmly i shall and i will too said anthea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robert was not pleased at being checked in his flight of fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you girls will never be great writers he said bitterly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they just love to think of things in dungeons and chains and knobbly jane had opened her mouth to scream but before she could decide how you began when you wanted to faint the golden voice of the phoenix spoke through the gloom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it said there are no bones here except the small but useful sets that you have inside you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you did not invite me to come out with you to hear you talk about bones but to see you do we cant do it here said robert sulkily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only thing we can do here it seems he didnt really and im not so very little said jane rather ungratefully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was cyril who suggested that perhaps they had better take the money and go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that wouldnt be a kind act except to ourselves and it wouldnt be good whatever way you look at it said anthea to take money we might take it and spend it all on benefits to the poor and aged said cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that wouldnt make it right to steal said anthea stoutly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stealing is taking things that belong to some one else and thats right said robert with ironical approval stand here all day arguing while the candles burn out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll like it awfully lets get out then said anthea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they rolled up the carpet and went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when they had crept along to the place where the passage led into the topless tower they found the way blocked by a great stone which they could not move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything has two ends said the phoenix softly even a so they turned round and went back and robert was made to go first with one of the candles because he was the one who had begun to talk about bones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you hadnt put bones into our heads said jane as they went along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passage was long and there were arches and steps and turnings and dark alcoves that the girls did not much like passing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passage ended in a flight of steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he staggered heavily back on to the following feet of ive only bashed my head in said robert when he had groaned for some time thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stairs just go right slap into the ceiling and its a stone ceiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you stairs arent made to lead just to pavingstones as a general there isnt any wheel said the injured robert still rubbing his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but cyril had pushed past him to the top stair and was already shoving his hardest against the stone above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it did not give in the least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he stopped shoving and began to feel about with his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by a happy chance cyril had in his pocket the oilcan of his fathers bicycle he put the carpet down at the foot of the stairs and he lay on his back with his head on the top step and his feet straggling down among his young relations and he oiled the bolt till the drops of rust and oil fell down on his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one even went into his mouthopen as he panted with the exertion of keeping up this unnatural position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he tried again but still the bolt would not move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so now he tied his handkerchiefthe one with the baconfat and marmalade on itto the bolt and roberts handkerchief to that in a reef knot which cannot come undone however much you pull and indeed gets tighter and tighter the more you pull it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this must not be confused with a granny knot which comes undone if you look at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he and robert pulled and the girls put their arms round their brothers and pulled too and suddenly the bolt gave way with a rusty scrunch and they all rolled together to the bottom of the stairsall but the phoenix which had taken to its wings when the pulling began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody was hurt much because the rolledup carpet broke their fall and now indeed the shoulders of the boys were used to some purpose for the stone allowed them to heave it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they felt it give dust fell freely on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now then cried robert forgetting his head and his temper the stone was heaved up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it swung up on a creaking unwilling hinge and showed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight and it fell back with a bang against something that kept it upright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every one climbed out but there was not room for every one to stand comfortably in the little paved house where they found themselves so when the phoenix had fluttered up from the darkness they let the stone down and it closed like a trapdoor as indeed it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can have no idea how dusty and dirty the children were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately there was no one to see them but each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place they were in was a little shrine built on the side of a road that went winding up through yellowgreen fields to the topless tower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> below them were fields and orchards all bare boughs and brown furrows and little houses and gardens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stooped and picked up the tambourine and began to play mechanically but continued to speak t how long are you in the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked phil speaking of course only two weeks answered lucia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am so glad to see you filippo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think it is somewhere about two months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and did you see my mother before you came away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me if i saw you to say tha she longed for her dear boy to return that she thought of hi day and night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked phil anxiously for he had she is well filipposhe is not sick but she is thin and sh looks sad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will go and see her some day said phil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> filippo glanced at the organgrinder whom he did not dare t another boy took it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come lucia said the man roughly ceasing to play we mus go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucia followed her companion obediently reluctant to leave phil with whom she desired to converse longer but the latter saw tha her guardian did not wish the conversation to continue and s this unexpected meeting with lucia gave him much to think of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i carried back his thoughts to his humble but still dear italia home and the mother from whom he had never met with anything bu kindness and a longing to see both made him for the momen almost sad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was naturally of a joyous temperament an i will save money enough to go home he said to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not take very much not more than fifty dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can ge it soon if i do not have to pay money to the padrone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as may be inferred phil did not expect to return home in style <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a firstclass ticket on a cunarder was far above hi expectations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would be content to go by steerage all the way and that could probably be done for the sum he named <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so hi he was aroused from his thoughts of home by a hand lai familiarly on his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turning he saw a bootblack whos adventures have been chronicled in the volume called ragge dick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had become acquainted some three months before dic having acted as a protector to phil against some rough boys o youre a green one said dick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall have to take you int my bankin house and give you some training in business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pointing to a imposinglooking structure in front of which they were jus passing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my clerks is all hard to work in there while i go ou to take the air for the benefit of my constitushun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phil looked puzzled not quite understanding dicks chaffing an looked rather inquiringly at the blacking box finding it little difficult to understand why a banker on so large a scal shine your boots sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blackin boots is good exercise continued dick answering th doubt in phils face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do it for the benefit of my health thus combinin profit with salubriousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant understand such long words said phil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would talk to you in italian said dick only it makes m head ache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent sold it an bought erie shares have you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a boy stole it from me and broke it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pleasantness so radiated from the boys faces and from their general appearance of clean white flannel trousers and soft clean shirts of pink and blue that a driver on a passing car leaned to look after them with a smile and a butcher hailed them with loud brotherhood from his cart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they turned a corner and from a long way off came the sight of the tower of memorial hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plain above all intervening tenements and foliage it rose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over there beneath its shadow were examinations and oscar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it caught billys roving eye and he nudged bertie pointing silently to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beneath his light whip the gelding sprang forward into its stride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oscar rose doubtfully from his chair in billys study <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he looked into billys bedroom and at the empty bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he went for a moment and watched the still forcibly sleeping john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned his eyes this way and that and after standing for a while moved quietly back to his chair and sat down with the leather wallet of notes on his lap his knees together and his unblocked shoes touching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in due time the clocks of massachusetts struck noon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a meadow where a brown amber stream ran lay bertie and billy on the grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their summer coats were off their belts loosened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they watched with eyes half closed the long waterweeds moving gently as the current waved and twined them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the black gelding brought along a farm road and through a gate waited at its ease in the field beside a stone wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heaven shield all imitators of san carlo borromeo as it shielded him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a reforming pope would need a little the subterranean chapel in which the body of san carlo borromeo is preserved presents as striking and as ghastly a contrast perhaps as any place can show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tapers which are lighted down there flash and gleam on altirilievi in gold and silver delicately wrought by skilful hands and representing the principal events in the life of the saint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jewels and precious metals shine and sparkle on every side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a windlass slowly removes the front of the altar and within it in a gorgeous shrine of gold and silver is seen through alabaster the shrivelled mummy of a man the pontifical robes with which it is adorned radiant with diamonds emeralds rubies every costly and magnificent gem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shrunken heap of poor earth in the midst of this great glitter is more pitiful than if it lay upon a dunghill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is not a ray of imprisoned light in all the flash and fire of jewels but seems to mock the dusty holes where eyes were once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every thread of silk in the rich vestments seems only a provision from the worms that in the old refectory of the dilapidated convent of santa maria delle grazie is the work of art perhaps better known than any other in the world the last supper by leonardo da vinci with a door cut through it by the intelligent dominican friars to i am not mechanically acquainted with the art of painting and have no other means of judging of a picture than as i see it resembling and refining upon nature and presenting graceful combinations of forms and colours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am therefore no authority whatever in reference to the touch of this or that master though i know very well as anybody may who chooses to think about the matter that few very great masters can possibly have painted in the compass of their lives onehalf of the pictures that bear their names and that are recognised by many aspirants to a reputation for taste as undoubted originals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the last supper i would simply observe that in its beautiful composition and arrangement there it is at milan a wonderful picture and that in its original colouring or in its original expression of any single face or feature there it is not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apart from the damage it has sustained from damp decay or neglect it has been as barry shows so retouched upon and repainted and that so clumsily that many of the heads are now positive deformities with patches of paint and plaster sticking upon them like wens and utterly distorting the expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where the original artist set that impress of his genius on a face which almost in a line or touch separated him from meaner painters and made him what he was succeeding bunglers filling up or painting across seams and cracks have been quite unable to imitate his hand and putting in some scowls or frowns or wrinkles of their own have blotched and spoiled the work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is so well established as an historical fact that i should not repeat it at the risk of being tedious but for having observed an english gentleman before the picture who was at great pains to fall into what i may describe as mild convulsions at certain minute details of expression which are not left in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereas it would be comfortable and rational for travellers and critics to arrive at a general understanding that it cannot fail to have been a work of extraordinary merit once when with so few of its original beauties remaining the grandeur of the general design is yet sufficient to sustain it as a piece we achieved the other sights of milan in due course and a fine city it is though not so unmistakably italian as to possess the characteristic qualities of many towns far less important in themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the corso where the milanese gentry ride up and down in carriages and rather than not do which they would half starve themselves at home is a most noble public promenade shaded by long avenues of trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the splendid theatre of la scala there was a ballet of action performed after the opera under the title of prometheus in the beginning of which some hundred or two of men and women represented our mortal race before the refinements of the arts and sciences and loves and graces came on earth to soften them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> generally speaking the pantomimic action of the italians is more remarkable for its sudden and impetuous character than for its delicate expression but in this case the drooping monotony the weary miserable listless moping life the sordid passions and desires of human creatures destitute of those elevating influences to which we owe so much and to whose promoters we render so little were expressed in a manner really powerful and affecting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have thought it almost impossible to present such an idea so milan soon lay behind us at five oclock in the morning and before the golden statue on the summit of the cathedral spire was lost in the blue sky the alps stupendously confused in lofty still we continued to advance toward them until nightfall and all day long the mountain tops presented strangely shifting shapes as the road displayed them in different points of view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beautiful day was just declining when we came upon the lago maggiore with its lovely islands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for however fanciful and fantastic the isola bella may be and is it still is beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything springing out of that blue water with that scenery around it was ten oclock at night when we got to domo dossola at the foot of the pass of the simplon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as the moon was shining brightly and there was not a cloud in the starlit sky it was no time for going to bed or going anywhere but on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we got a it was late in november and the snow lying four or five feet thick in the beaten road on the summit in other parts the new drift was already deep the air was piercing cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the serenity of the night and the grandeur of the road with its impenetrable shadows and deep glooms and its sudden turns into the shining of the moon and its incessant roar of falling water rendered the journey more soon leaving the calm italian villages below us sleeping in the moonlight the road began to wind among dark trees and after a time emerged upon a barer region very steep and toilsome where the moon shone bright and high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees the roar of water grew louder and the stupendous track after crossing the torrent by a bridge struck in between two massive perpendicular walls of rock that quite shut out the moonlight and only left a few stars shining in the narrow strip of sky above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then even this was lost in the thick darkness of a cavern in the rock through which the way was pierced the terrible cataract thundering and roaring close below it and its foam and spray hanging in a mist about the entrance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emerging from this cave and coming again into the moonlight and across a dizzy bridge it crept and twisted upward through the gorge of gondo savage and grand beyond description with smoothfronted precipices rising up on either hand and almost meeting overhead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a bit except i didnt know where ak ak something was she answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats bath where the buns come parnesius pretended to thrust his spear at pucks legs but puck reached down caught at the horsetail plume and pulled off the tall helmet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thanks jester said parnesius shaking his curly dark head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now hang it up for me i was telling your sister how i joined the army he said to dan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went to my father and said i should like to enter the dacian horse i had seen some at aquae sulis but he said i had better begin service in a regular legion from rome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now like many of our youngsters i was not too fond of anything roman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the romanborn officers and magistrates looked down on us britishborn as though we were barbarians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know they do he said but remember after all we are the people of the old stock and our duty is to the empire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we split the eagle before i was born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir i said weve one emperor in rome and i dont know how many emperors the outlying provinces have set up from time to time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hasnt he turned himself into a rawbeefeating scythian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this precious emperor gratian of ours had a bodyguard of furcloaked scythians and he was so crazy about them that he dressed like them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in rome of all places in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as bad as if my own father had painted himself blue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no matter for the clothes said the pater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are only the fringe of the trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rome has forsaken her gods and must be punished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great war with the painted people broke out in the very year the temples of our gods were destroyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we beat the painted people in the very year our temples were rebuilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went back to the time of diocletian and to listen to him you would have thought eternal rome herself was on the edge of destruction just because a few people had become a little largeminded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aglaia never taught us the history of our own country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was so full of her ancient greeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no hope for rome said the pater at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has forsaken her gods but if the gods forgive us here we may save britain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to do that we must keep the painted people back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore i tell you parnesius as a father that if your heart is set on service your place is among men on the wall and not with women among what wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father meant the one we call hadrians wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was built long ago across north britain to keep out the painted people picts you call them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father had fought in the great pict war that lasted more than twenty years and he knew what fighting meant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theodosius one of our great generals had chased the little beasts back far into the north before i was born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down at vectis of course we never troubled our heads about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when my father spoke as he did i kissed his hand and waited for orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we british if i kissed my fathers hand hed laugh said dan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> customs change but if you do not obey your father the gods remember it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after our talk seeing i was in earnest the pater sent me over to clausentum to learn my footdrill in a barrack full of foreign auxiliaries as unwashed and unshaved a mob of mixed barbarians as ever scrubbed a breastplate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was your stick in their stomachs and your shield in their faces to push them into any sort of formation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i had learned my work the instructor gave me a handful and they were a handful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of gauls and iberians to polish up till they were sent to their stations upcountry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did my best and one night a villa in the suburbs caught fire and i had my handful out and at work before any of the other troops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i noticed a quietlooking man on the lawn leaning on a stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he watched us passing buckets from the pond and at last he said to me who are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a probationer waiting for a command i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know who he was from deucalion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes if you were born in spain i said for he neighed his words like an iberian mule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what might you call yourself when you are at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that depends i answered sometimes one thing and sometimes another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said no more till we had saved the family gods they were respectable householders and then he grunted across the laurels listen young sometimes onethingandsometimesanother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in future call yourself centurion of the seventh cohort of the thirtieth the ulpia victrix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father and a few other people call me maximus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tossed me the polished stick he was leaning on and went away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might have knocked me down with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the general of britain who had been theodosiuss right hand in the pict war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only had he given me my centurions stick direct but three steps in a good legion as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then faithful stepped forward again and said to talkative come what cheer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought we should have had a great deal of talk by this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well if you will we will fall to it now and since you left it with me to state the question let it be this how doth the saving grace of god discover itself when it is in the heart of man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> talkatives false discovery of a work of grace talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i perceive then that our talk must be about the power of things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it is a very good question and i shall be willing to answer you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and take my answer in brief thus first where the grace of god is in the heart it causeth there faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay hold let us consider of one at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you should rather say it shows itself by inclining the soul to abhor its sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why what difference is there between crying out against and abhorring of sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to cry out against sin no sign of grace faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man may cry out against sin of policy but he cannot abhor it but by virtue of a godly antipathy against it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard many cry out against sin in the pulpit who yet can abide it well enough in the heart house and conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> josephs mistress cried out with a loud voice as if she had been very holy but she would willingly notwithstanding that have committed uncleanness with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some cry out against sin even as the mother cries out against her child in her lap when she calleth it slut and naughty girl and then falls to hugging and kissing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no not i i am only for setting things right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what is the second thing whereby you would prove a discovery of a work of grace in the heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this sign should have been first but first or last it is also false for knowledge great knowledge may be obtained in the mysteries of the gospel and yet no work of grace in the soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea if a man have all knowledge he may yet be nothing and so consequently be no child of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when christ said do you know all these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the disciples had answered yes he addeth blessed are ye if ye do them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he doth not lay the blessing in the knowing of them but in the doing of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for there is a knowledge that is not attended with doing he that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man may know like an angel and yet be no christian therefore your sign of it is not true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed to know is a thing that pleaseth talkers and boasters but to do is that which pleaseth god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that the heart can be good without knowledge for without that the heart is naught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knowledge and knowledge there is therefore knowledge and knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knowledge that resteth in the bare speculation of things and knowledge that is accompanied with the grace of faith and love which puts a man upon doing even the will of god from the heart the first of these will serve the talker but without the other the true christian is not content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> true knowledge attended with endeavors give me understanding and i shall keep thy law talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you lie at the catch again this is not for edification <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well if you please propound another sign how this work of grace discovereth itself where it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not i for i see we shall not agree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well if you will not will you give me leave to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a work of grace in the soul discovereth itself either to him that hath it or to standers by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to him that hath it thus it gives him conviction of sin especially of the defilement of his nature and the sin of unbelief for the sake of which he is sure to be damned if he findeth not mercy at gods hand by faith in jesus christ john rom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john mark this sight and sense of things worketh in him sorrow and shame for sin he findeth moreover revealed in him the saviour of the world and the absolute necessity of closing with him for life at the which he findeth hungerings and thirstings after him to which hungerings c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now according to the strength or weakness of his faith in his saviour so is his joy and peace so is his love to holiness so are his desires to know him more and also to serve him in this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but though i say it discovereth itself thus unto him yet it is but seldom that he is able to conclude that this is a work of grace because his corruptions now and his abused reason make his mind to misjudge in this matter therefore in him that hath this work there is required a very sound judgement before he can with steadiness conclude that this is a work of grace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by an experimental confession of his faith in christ <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by a life answerable to that confession to wit a life of holiness heartholiness familyholiness if he hath a family and by conversationholiness in the world which in the general teacheth him inwardly to abhor his sin and himself for that in secret to suppress it in his family and to promote holiness in the world not by talk only as a hypocrite or talkative person may do but by a practical subjection in faith and love to the power of the word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a wild dream that of wresting the metal from tal hajus in five short years but his advance was rapid and he soon stood high in the councils of thark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but one day the chance was lost forever in so far as it could come in time to save his loved ones for he was ordered away upon a long expedition to the iceclad south to make war upon the natives there and despoil them of their furs for such is the manner of the green barsoomian he does not labor for what he can wrest in battle from others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was gone for four years and when he returned all had been over for three for about a year after his departure and shortly before the time for the return of an expedition which had gone forth to fetch the fruits of a community incubator the egg had hatched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereafter my mother continued to keep me in the old tower visiting me nightly and lavishing upon me the love the community life would have robbed us both of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hoped upon the return of the expedition from the incubator to mix me with the other young assigned to the quarters of tal hajus and thus escape the fate which would surely follow discovery of her sin against the ancient traditions of the green men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she taught me rapidly the language and customs of my kind and one night she told me the story i have told to you up to this point impressing upon me the necessity for absolute secrecy and the great caution i must exercise after she had placed me with the other young tharks to permit no one to guess that i was further advanced in education than they nor by any sign to divulge in the presence of others my affection for her or my knowledge of my parentage and then drawing me close to her she whispered in my ear the name of my father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then a light flashed out upon the darkness of the tower chamber and there stood sarkoja her gleaming baleful eyes fixed in a frenzy of loathing and contempt upon my mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the torrent of hatred and abuse she poured out upon her turned my young heart cold in terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that she had heard the entire story was apparent and that she had suspected something wrong from my mothers long nightly absences from her quarters accounted for her presence there on that fateful night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing she had not heard nor did she know the whispered name of my father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was apparent from her repeated demands upon my mother to disclose the name of her partner in sin but no amount of abuse or threats could wring this from her and to save me from needless torture she lied for she told sarkoja that she alone knew nor would she even tell her child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with final imprecations sarkoja hastened away to tal hajus to report her discovery and while she was gone my mother wrapping me in the silks and furs of her night coverings so that i was scarcely noticeable descended to the streets and ran wildly away toward the outskirts of the city in the direction which led to the far south out toward the man whose protection she might not claim but on whose face she wished to look once more before she died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we neared the citys southern extremity a sound came to us from across the mossy flat from the direction of the only pass through the hills which led to the gates the pass by which caravans from either north or south or east or west would enter the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sounds we heard were the squealing of thoats and the grumbling of zitidars with the occasional clank of arms which announced the approach of a body of warriors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought uppermost in her mind was that it was my father returned from his expedition but the cunning of the thark held her from headlong and precipitate flight to greet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> retreating into the shadows of a doorway she awaited the coming of the cavalcade which shortly entered the avenue breaking its formation and thronging the thoroughfare from wall to wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the head of the procession passed us the lesser moon swung clear of the overhanging roofs and lit up the scene with all the brilliancy of her wondrous light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother shrank further back into the friendly shadows and from her hiding place saw that the expedition was not that of my father but the returning caravan bearing the young tharks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly her plan was formed and as a great chariot swung close to our hiding place she slipped stealthily in upon the trailing tailboard crouching low in the shadow of the high side straining me to her bosom in a frenzy of love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew what i did not that never again after that night would she hold me to her breast nor was it likely we would ever look upon each others face again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the confusion of the plaza she mixed me with the other children whose guardians during the journey were now free to relinquish their responsibility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were herded together into a great room fed by women who had not accompanied the expedition and the next day we were parceled out among the retinues of the chieftains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw my mother after that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was imprisoned by tal hajus and every effort including the most horrible and shameful torture was brought to bear upon her to wring from her lips the name of my father but she remained steadfast and loyal dying at last amidst the laughter of tal hajus and his chieftains during some awful torture she was undergoing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i learned afterwards that she told them that she had killed me to save me from a like fate at their hands and that she had thrown my body to the white apes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sarkoja alone disbelieved her and i feel to this day that she suspects my true origin but does not dare expose me at the present at all events because she also guesses i am sure the identity of my father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he returned from his expedition and learned the story of my mothers fate i was present as tal hajus told him but never by the quiver of a muscle did he betray the slightest emotion only he did not laugh as tal hajus gleefully described her death struggles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that moment on he was the cruelest of the cruel and i am awaiting the day when he shall win the goal of his ambition and feel the carcass of tal hajus beneath his foot for i am as sure that he but waits the opportunity to wreak a terrible vengeance and that his great love is as strong in his breast as when it first transfigured him nearly forty years ago as i am that we sit here upon the edge of a worldold ocean while sensible people sleep john carter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and your father sola is he with us now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she replied but he does not know me for what i am nor does he know who betrayed my mother to tal hajus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i alone know my fathers name and only i and tal hajus and sarkoja know that it was she who carried the tale that brought death and torture upon her he loved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more i have escaped with my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun came out in full splendor and the sea became as calm as a lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the marionette took off his clothes and laid them on the sand to dry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked over the waters to see whether he might catch sight of a boat with a little man in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he searched and he searched but he saw nothing except sea and sky and far away a few sails so small that they might have been birds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if only i knew the name of this island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i even knew what kind of people i would find here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of finding himself in so lonesome a spot made him so sad that he was about to cry but just then he saw a big fish swimming nearby with his head far out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fish may i have a word with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even two if you want answered the fish who happened to be a very polite dolphin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you please tell me if on this island there are places where one may eat without necessarily being eaten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact youll find one not far from this spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take that path on your left and follow your nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you who travel day and night through the sea did you not perhaps meet a little boat with my father in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is the best father in the world even as i am the worst son that can be found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the storm of last night answered the dolphin the little boat must have been swamped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time he must have been swallowed by the terrible shark which for the last few days has been bringing terror to these waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked pinocchio who was beginning to tremble with fright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just to give you an idea of his size let me tell you that he is larger than a five story building and that he has a mouth so big and so deep that a whole train and engine could easily get into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the marionette scared to death and dressing himself as fast as he could he turned to the farewell mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pardon the bother and many thanks for your kindness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this said he took the path at so swift a gait that he seemed to fly and at every small sound he heard he turned in fear to see whether the terrible shark five stories high and with a train in his mouth was following him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after walking a half hour he came to a small country called the land of the busy bees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the streets were filled with people running to and fro about their tasks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if one were to search with a lantern not one idle man or one tramp could have been found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understand said pinocchio at once wearily this is no place for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the meantime he began to feel hungry for it was twentyfour hours since he had eaten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were only two means left to him in order to get a bite to eat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had either to work or to beg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was ashamed to beg because his father had always preached to him that begging should be done only by the sick or the old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had said that the real poor in this world deserving of our pity and help were only those who either through age or sickness had lost the means of earning their bread with their own hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all others should work and if they didnt and went hungry so much the worse for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then a man passed by worn out and wet with perspiration pulling with difficulty two heavy carts filled with coal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pinocchio looked at him and judging him by his looks will you be so good as to give me a penny for i am faint with hunger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only one penny answered the coal man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill give you four if you will help me pull these two wagons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why he asked if you could do that did you not kill me long before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you i replied that i had no quarrel with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not care to kill men with whom i have no quarrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he could not seem to get the idea through his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can believe now that you are not of caspak he admitted for no caspakian would have permitted such an opportunity to escape him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this however i found later to be an exaggeration as the tribes of the west coast and even the krolu of the east coast are far less bloodthirsty than he would have had me believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you spoke true words when i thought you spoke lies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not at the time well enough acquainted with caspakian ways to know that truthfulness and loyalty are two of the strongest characteristics of these primitive people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not sufficiently cultured to have become adept in hypocrisy treason and dissimulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can go north together continued the warrior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will fight for you and you can fight for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until death will i serve you for you have saved soal whom i had given up as dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he threw down his spear and covered both his eyes with the palms of his two hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked inquiringly toward ajor who explained as best she could that this was the form of the caspakian oath of allegiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you need never fear him after this she concluded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take his hands down from before his eyes and return his spear to him she explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did as she bade and the man seemed very pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then asked what i should have done had i not wished to accept his friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they told me that had i walked away the moment that i was out of sight of the warrior we would have become deadly enemies again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i could so easily have killed him as he stood there defenseless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes replied the warrior but no man with good sense blinds his eyes before one whom he does not trust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was rather a decent compliment and it taught me just how much i might rely on the loyalty of my new friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was glad to have him with us for he knew the country and was evidently a fearless warrior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wished that i might have recruited a battalion like him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the women were now approaching the cliffs tomar the warrior suggested that we make our way to the valley before they could intercept us as they might attempt to detain us and were almost certain to set upon ajor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we hastened down the narrow path reaching the foot of the cliffs but a short distance ahead of the women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they called after us to stop but we kept on at a rapid walk not wishing to have any trouble with them which could only result in the death of some of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had proceeded about a mile when we heard some one behind us calling tomar by name and when we stopped and looked around we saw a woman running rapidly toward us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she approached nearer i could see that she was a very comely creature and like all her sex that i had seen in caspak apparently young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is the church clock chiming the hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would interest our philosophers to know that manmade mechanisms has survived the race who made it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried lord john rising excitedly from his chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we heard the roar of it and presently it came flying into sight going at what seemed to me to be a prodigious speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whence it had come or how far we had no means of knowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only by some miracle of luck could it have gone any distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now we were to see the terrific end of its career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a train of coal trucks stood motionless upon the line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we held our breath as the express roared along the same track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> engine and carriages piled themselves into a hill of splintered wood and twisted iron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> red spurts of flame flickered up from the wreckage until it was all ablaze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for half an hour we sat with hardly a word stunned by the stupendous sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> challenger at last clinging with a whimper to her husbands arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear the passengers on that train were no more animate than the coals into which they crashed or the carbon which they have now become said challenger stroking her hand soothingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a train of the living when it left victoria but it was driven and freighted by the dead long before it reached its fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all over the world the same thing must be going on said i as a vision of strange happenings rose before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think of the ships at seahow they will steam on and on until the furnaces die down or until they run full tilt upon some beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sailing ships toohow they will back and fill with their cargoes of dead sailors while their timbers rot and their joints leak till one by one they sink below the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps a century hence the atlantic may still be dotted with the old drifting derelicts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the folk in the coalmines said summerlee with a dismal chuckle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever geologists should by any chance live upon earth again they will have some strange theories of the existence of man in carboniferous strata <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont profess to know about such things remarked lord john but it seems to me the earth will be to let empty after this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when once our human crowd is wiped off it how will it ever get on again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the world was empty before challenger answered gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under laws which in their inception are beyond and above us it became peopled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why may the same process not happen again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not in the habit professor summerlee of saying things which i do not mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out went the beard and down came the eyelids <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you lived an obstinate dogmatist and you mean to die one said summerlee sourly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you sir have lived an unimaginative obstructionist and never can hope now to emerge from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your worst critics will never accuse you of lacking imagination summerlee retorted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> growled his comrade you have drunk too much of that confounded brandyandwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and taking him by the arm he half led him half forced him out of the smokingroom and we heard them stumbling up the companion together and on to the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said why i think what his companion thinks that we have been listening to the ravings of a halfdrunken man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nonsense dick i you saw how the other tried to stop his tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he didnt want his friend to make a fool of himself before strangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe the short one is a lunatic and the other his private keeper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o dick dick i cried how can you be so blind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you see that every word confirmed our previous suspicion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said dick youre working yourself into a state of nervous excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why what the devil do you make of all that nonsense about a mysterious agent which would signal our whereabouts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill tell you what he meant dick i said bending forward and grasping my friends arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he meant a sudden glare and a flash seen far out at sea by some lonely fisherman off the american coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt think you were such a fool hammond said dick merton testily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you try to fix a literal meaning on the twaddle that every drunken man talks you will come to some queer conclusions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us follow their example and go on deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> depend upon it your liver is out of order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a seavoyage will do you a world of good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever i see the end of this one i groaned ill promise never to venture on another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are laying the cloth so its hardly worth while my going up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope dinner will find you in a more pleasant state of mind said dick and he went out leaving me to my thoughts until the clang of the great gong summoned us to the saloon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my appetite i need hardly say had not been improved by the incidents which had occurred during the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat down however mechanically at the table and listened to the talk which was going on around me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were nearly a hundred firstclass passengers and as the wine began to circulate their voices combined with the clash of the dishes to form a perfect babel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found myself seated between a very stout and nervous old lady and a prim little clergyman and as neither made any advances i retired into my shell and spent my time in observing the appearance of my fellow voyagers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see dick in the dim distance dividing his attentions between a jointless fowl in front of him and a self possessed young lady at his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain dowie was doing the honours at my end while the surgeon of the vessel was seated at the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was glad to notice that flannigan was placed almost opposite to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as i had him before my eyes i knew that for the time at least we were safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sitting with what was meant to be a sociable smile on his grim face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did not escape me that he drank largely of wineso largely that even before the dessert appeared his voice had become decidedly husky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his friend muller was seated a few places lower down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ate little and appeared to be nervous and restless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ladies said our genial captain i trust that you will consider yourselves at home aboard my vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres to a fresh breeze and a quick passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i trust our friends in america will hear of our safe arrival in eight days or in nine at the very latest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quick as was the glance which passed between flannigan and his confederate i was able to intercept it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an evil smile upon the formers thin lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> politics the sea amusements religion each was in turn discussed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remained a silent though an interested listener <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it struck me that no harm could be done by introducing the subject which was ever in my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it could be managed in an offhand way and would at least have the effect of turning the captains thoughts in that direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could watch too what effect it would have upon the faces of the conspirators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a sudden lull in the conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ordinary subjects of interest appeared to be exhausted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i ask captain i said bending forward and speaking very distinctly what you think of fenian manifestoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captains ruddy face became a shade darker from honest indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are poor cowardly things he said as silly as they are wicked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the impotent threats of a set of anonymous scoundrels said a pompouslooking old gentleman beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the fat lady at my side you dont really think they would blow up a ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no doubt they would if they could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am very sure they shall never blow up mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i ask what precautions are taken against them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked an elderly man at the end of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all goods sent aboard the ship are strictly examined said captain dowie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but suppose a man brought explosives aboard with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are too cowardly to risk their own lives in that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during this conversation flannigan had not betrayed the slightest interest in what was going on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raised his head now and looked at the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think you are rather underrating them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every secret society has produced desperate menwhy shouldnt the fenians have them too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many men think it a privilege to die in the service of a cause which seems right in their eyes though others may think it wrong indiscriminate murder cannot be right in anybodys eyes said the little clergyman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bombardment of paris was nothing else said flannigan yet the whole civilised world agreed to look on with folded arms and change the ugly word murder into the more euphonious one of war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed right enough to german eyes why shouldnt dynamite seem so to the fenian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate their empty vapourings have led to nothing as yet said the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me returned flannigan but is there not some room for doubt yet as to the fate of the dotterel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have met men in america who asserted from their own personal knowledge that there was a coal torpedo aboard that vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was proved conclusively at the courtmartial to have arisen from an explosion of coalgasbut we had better change the subject or we may cause the ladies to have a restless night and the conversation once more drifted back into its original channel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during this little discussion flannigan had argued his point with a gentlemanly deference and a quiet power for which i had not given him credit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katy counted out the sticks wrapped them up in a paper and put the money in her pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she had stopped at the door to study the young mans face she might have detected a shadow of uneasiness and anxiety upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a very goodhearted but rather dissolute young man and the allusions she had made to his mother burned like fire in his heart for he had neglected her counsels and wandered from the straight road in which she had taught him to walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she could have followed him home and into the solitude of his chamber she could have seen him open his desk and write a long letter to his distant mothera duty he had too long neglected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we may not follow the fortunes of this young man but if we could we might see how a few words fitly spoken even by the lips of an innocent youth will sometimes produce a powerful impression on the character will sometimes change the whole current of a life and reach forward to the last day of existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katy all unconscious of the great work she had done congratulated herself on this success and wished she might find a few more such customers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glancing into the shop windows as she passed along to ascertain whether there was a good prospect for her she soon found an inviting field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a crockery ware store that she entered this time and there were several persons there who seemed not to be very busy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said she presenting the tray to the first person she met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go home and wash your face was the illnatured response <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it possible she had come out with a dirty face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she had washed herself the last thing she had done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true her clothes were shabby there was many a patch and darn upon her dress and its colors had faded out like the last rose of summer but then the dress was clean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said she to another with a sudden resolution not to be disturbed by the rudeness of those she addressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took a stick and threw down a cent without a word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one more did her a similar favor and she left the store well satisfied with the visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pretty soon she came to a large pianoforte manufactory where she knew that a great many men were employed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went upstairs to the countingroom where she sold three sticks and was about to enter the workroom when a sign no admittance except on business confronted her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had business there but perhaps they would not be willing to admit that her business was very urgent and she dreaded the indignity of being turned out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her mother had told her there was always a right way and a wrong way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it certainly was not right to enter in the face of a positive prohibition and at last she decided to return to the office and ask permission to visit the workshop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said she addressing the man who had purchased the candy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied he placing his pen behind his ear and looking at her with a smile of curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why it says on the door no admittance except on business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i declare you have got an amount of conscience beyond your station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one thinks of taking any notice of that sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peddlers and apple men go in without a question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you wouldnt let people go in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont like to have visitors there for they sometimes do injury and generally take off the attention of the men from their work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you have got so much conscience about the matter that you shall not only go in but i will go with you and introduce you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you sir i wont give you all that trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the bookkeeper led the way to the door and they entered a large room in which a great many men were busily at work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is a very honest little girl said her friend who has the very best molasses candy i ever ate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any of you have a sweet tooth or any children at home i advise you to patronize her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bookkeeper laughed and the workmen laughed as they began to feel in their pockets for loose change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was evident that the friendly introduction was to be of great service to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she passed along from one man to another and almost every one of them bought two or three sticks of candy and before she had been to all of them her stock was entirely exhausted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katy was astonished at her good fortune and the men were all exceedingly goodnatured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed disposed to make a pleasant thing of her visit and to give her a substantial benefit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now my little girl said the bookkeeper when you wish to visit the workshop again you may enter without further permission and i am sure the men will all be very glad to see you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i want some of that candy said one of the workmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my little girl would jump to get a stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i will go home and get some more and she left the building and hastened home for a further supply of the popular merchandise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have sold out all my candy and i want a lot more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed she as she rushed into the room full of excitement and enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be calm child you will throw yourself into a fever replied mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must learn to take things more easily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early tradition attributes the building of stonehenge to the power of merlin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was believed that those mighty stones were whirled through the air at his command from ireland to salisbury plain and that he arranged them in the form in which they now stand to commemorate for ever the unhappy fate of three hundred british chiefs who were massacred on that spot by the saxons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at abergwylly near caermarthen is still shown the cave of the prophet and the scene of his incantations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how beautiful is the description of it given by spenser in his faerie queene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lines need no apology for their repetition here and any sketch of the great there the wise merlin whilom wont they say to make his wonne low underneath the ground in a deep delve far from the view of day that of no living wight he mote be found whenso he counselled with his sprites encompassed round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if thou ever happen that same way to travel go to see that dreadful place it is a hideous hollow cave they say under a rock that lies a little space from the swift barry tumbling down apace amongst the woody hills of dynevoure but dare thou not i charge in any case to enter into that same baleful bower for fear the cruel fiendes should thee unwares devour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but standing high aloft low lay thine care and there such ghastly noise of iron chaines and brazen caudrons thou shalt rombling heare which thousand sprites with longenduring paines doe tosse that it will stun thy feeble braines and often times great groans and grievous stownds when too huge toile and labour them constraines and often times loud strokes and ringing sounds from under that deep rock most horribly rebounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little while before that merlin died he did intend a brazen wall in compass to compile about cayr merdin and did it commend unto these sprites to bring to perfect end during which work the lady of the lake whom long he loved for him in haste did send who thereby forced his workmen to forsake them bound till his return their labour not to slake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the mean time through that false ladies traine he was surprised and buried under biere ne ever to his work returned again natheless these fiendes may not their work forbeare so greatly his commandement they fear but there doe toile and travaile day and night until that brazen wall they up doe reare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amongst other english prophets a belief in whose power has not been entirely effaced by the light of advancing knowledge is robert nixon the cheshire idiot a contemporary of mother shipton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the popular accounts of this man say that he was born of poor parents not far from vale royal on the edge of the forest of delamere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was brought up to the plough but was so ignorant and stupid that nothing could be made of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody thought him irretrievably insane and paid no attention to the strange unconnected discourses which he held <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many of his prophecies are believed to have been lost in this manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they were not always destined to be wasted upon dull and inattentive ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an incident occurred which brought him into notice and established his fame as a prophet of the first calibre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was ploughing in a field when he suddenly stopped from his labour and with a wild look and strange gestures exclaimed now dick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his fellow labourers in the field did not know what to make of this rhapsody but the next day cleared up the mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> news was brought by a messenger in hot haste that at the very instant when nixon had thus ejaculated richard iii had been slain at the battle of bosworth and henry vii proclaimed king of england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not long before the fame of the new prophet reached the ears of the king who expressed a wish to see and converse with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a messenger was accordingly despatched to bring him to court but long before he reached cheshire nixon knew and dreaded the honours that awaited him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed it was said that at the very instant the king expressed the wish nixon was by supernatural means made acquainted with it and that he ran about the town of over in great distress of mind calling out like a madman that henry had sent for him and that he must go to court and be clammed that is starved to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these expressions excited no little wonder but on the third day the messenger arrived and carried him to court leaving on the minds of the good people of cheshire an impression that their prophet was one of the greatest ever born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his arrival king henry appeared to be troubled exceedingly at the loss of a valuable diamond and asked nixon if he could inform him where it was to be found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry had hidden the diamond himself with a view to test the prophets skill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great therefore was his surprise when nixon answered him in the words of the old proverb those who hide can find <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that time forth the king implicitly believed that he had the gift of prophecy and ordered all his words to be taken down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during all the time of his residence at court he was in constant fear of being starved to death and repeatedly told the king that such would be his fate if he were not allowed to depart and return into his own country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry would not suffer it but gave strict orders to all his officers and cooks to give him as much to eat as he wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lived so well that for some time he seemed to be thriving like a noblemans steward and growing as fat as an alderman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day the king went out hunting when nixon ran to the palace gate and entreated on his knees that he might not be left behind to be starved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king laughed and calling an officer told him to take especial care of the prophet during his absence and rode away to the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after his departure the servants of the palace began to jeer at and insult nixon whom they imagined to be much better treated than he deserved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nixon complained to the officer who to prevent him from being further molested locked him up in the kings own closet and brought him regularly his four meals a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it so happened that a messenger arrived from the king to this officer requiring his immediate presence at winchester on a matter of life and death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so great was his haste to obey the kings command that he mounted on the horse behind the messenger and rode off without bestowing a thought upon poor nixon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not return till three days afterwards when remembering the prophet for the first time he went to the kings closet and found him lying upon the floor starved to death as he had predicted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the prophecies of his which are believed to have been fulfilled are the following which relate to the times of the a great man shall come into england but the son of a king shall take from him the victory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crows shall drink the blood of many nobles and the north shall rise against the south <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cock of the north shall be made to flee and his feather be plucked for his pride that he shall almost curse the day that he was born all these say his admirers are as clear as the sun at noonday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first denotes the defeat of prince charles edward at the battle of culloden by the duke of cumberland the second the execution of lords derwentwater balmerino and lovat and the third the retreat of the pretender from the shores of britain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the prophecies that between seven eight and nine in england wonders shall be seen between nine and thirteen all sorrow shall be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through our own money and our men shall a dreadful war begin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between the sickle and the suck all england shall have a pluck foreign nations shall invade england with snow on their helmets and shall bring plague famine and murder in the skirts of their garments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town of nantwich shall be swept away by a flood of the two first of these no explanation has yet been attempted but some event or other will doubtless be twisted into such a shape as will fit them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third relative to the invasion of england by a nation with snow on their helmets is supposed by the old women to foretell most clearly the coming war with russia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to the last there are not a few in the town mentioned who devoutly believe that such will be its fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> happily for their peace of mind the prophet said nothing of the year that was to witness the awful calamity so that they think it as likely to be two centuries hence as now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the time there had been a few of the more idle of the inhabitants about the door but they had been rather quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now however the sounds of feet and voices began to grow and grew so rapidly that it was plain a multitude was gathering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the people of gwyntystorm always gave themselves an hour of pleasure after their second breakfast and what greater pleasure could they have than to see a stranger abused by the officers of justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noise grew till it was like the roaring of the sea and that roaring went on a long time for the magistrate being a great man liked to know that he was waited for it added to the enjoyment of his breakfast and indeed enabled him to eat a little more after he had thought his powers exhausted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at length in the waves of the human noises rose a bigger wave and by the running and shouting and outcry curdie learned that the magistrate was approaching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently came the sound of the great rusty key in the lock which yielded with groaning reluctance the door was thrown back the light rushed in and with it came the voice of the city marshal calling upon curdie by many legal epithets opprobrious to come forth and be tried for his life inasmuch as he had raised a tumult in his majestys city of gwyntystorm troubled the hearts of the kings baker and barber and slain the faithful dogs of his majestys wellbeloved butchers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was still reading and curdie was still seated in the brown twilight of the vault not listening but pondering with himself how this king the city marshal talked of could be the same with the majesty he had seen ride away on his grand white horse with the princess irene on a cushion before him when a scream of agonized terror arose on the farthest skirt of the crowd and swifter than flood or flame the horror spread shrieking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment the air was filled with hideous howling cries of unspeakable dismay and the multitudinous noise of running feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next moment in at the door of the vault bounded lina her two green eyes flaming yellow as sunflowers and seeming to light up the dungeon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with one spring she threw herself at curdies feet and laid her head upon them panting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came a rush of two or three soldiers darkening the doorway but it was only to lay hold of the key pull the door to and lock it so that once more curdie and lina were prisoners together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a few moments lina lay panting hard it is breathless work leaping and roaring both at once and that in a way to scatter thousands of people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she jumped up and began snuffing about all over the place and curdie saw what he had never seen before two faint spots of light cast from her eyes upon the ground one on each side of her snuffing nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got out his tinder box a miner is never without one and lighted a precious bit of candle he carried in a division of it just for a moment for he must not waste it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light revealed a vault without any window or other opening than the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mortar had vanished from between the stones and it was half filled with a heap of all sorts of rubbish beaten down in the middle but looser at the sides it sloped from the door to the foot of the opposite wall evidently for a long time the vault had been left open and every sort of refuse thrown into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a single minute served for the survey so little was there to note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime down in the angle between the back wall and the base of the heap lina was scratching furiously with all the eighteen great strong claws of her mighty feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said curdie to himself catching sight of her if only with that he ran to the door to see if there was any fastening on the inside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was none in all its long history it never had had one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a few blows of the right sort now from the one now from the other end of his mattock were as good as any bolt for they so ruined the lock that no key could ever turn in it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who heard them fancied he was trying to get out and laughed spitefully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as he had done he extinguished his candle and went down to lina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had reached the hard rock which formed the floor of the dungeon and was now clearing away the earth a little wider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she looked up in his face and whined as much as to say then get out of my way lina said curdie and mind you keep your so saying he heaved his mattock and assailed with the hammer end of it the spot she had cleared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rock was very hard but when it did break it broke in goodsized pieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now with hammer now with pick he worked till he was weary then rested and then set to again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not tell how the day went as he had no light but the lamping of linas eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the darkness hampered him greatly for he would not let lina come close enough to give him all the light she could lest he should strike her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he had every now and then to feel with his hands to know how he was getting on and to discover in what direction to strike the exact spot was a mere imagination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was getting very tired and hungry and beginning to lose heart a little when out of the ground as if he had struck a spring of it burst a dull gleamy leadcoloured light and the next moment he heard a hollow splash and echo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a piece of rock had fallen out of the floor and dropped into water beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already lina who had been lying a few yards off all the time he worked was on her feet and peering through the hole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> curdie got down on his hands and knees and looked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were over what seemed a natural cave in the rock to which apparently the river had access for at a great distance below a faint light was gleaming upon water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they could but reach it they might get out but even if it was deep enough the height was very dangerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing whatever might follow was to make the hole larger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh if i could only get hold of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chuckled ben to himself as he caught a sly glimpse of the indignant woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile squire newcome had walked along in his usual slow and dignified manner until he had reached the front door of the poorhouse and knocked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont go this time but if he knocks again ill fix him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took a dipper of hot suds from the tub in which she had been washing and crept carefully into the entry taking up a station close to the front door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the echo had not died away when the door was pulled suddenly open and a dipper full of hot suds was dashed into the face of the astonished squire accompanied with take that you young scamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gasped squire newcome nearly strangled with the suds a part of which had found its way into his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg your pardon squire newcome said the horrified mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mudge almost out of her wits with perplexity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come in sir and let me give you a towel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve no idea how ive been tried this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i trust said the squire in his stateliest tone you will be able to give a satisfactory explanation of this ahemextraordinary proceeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mudge was endeavoring to sooth the ruffled dignity of the aggrieved squire the young scamp who had caused all the mischief made his escape through the fields <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish paul had been here to see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mudge has got herself into a scrape now im thinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having attained a safe distance from the poorhouse ben doubled himself up and rolled over and over upon the grass convulsed with laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id give five dollars to see it all over again he said to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never had such splendid fun in my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the squire emerged his tall dicky looking decidedly limp and drooping his face expressing annoyance and outraged dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mudge attended him to the door with an expression of anxious concern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess id better make tracks said ben to himself it wont do for the old gentleman to see me here or he may smell a rat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he accordingly scrambled over a stone wall and lay quietly hidden behind it till he judged it would be safe to make his appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> benjamin said squire newcome two days after the occurrence mentioned in the last chapter what made the dog howl so this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave him his breakfast said ben innocently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps he was hungry and howling for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not refer to that said the squire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he howled as if in pain or terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i repeat was you a doing anything to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben shifted from one foot to the other and looked out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i desire a categorical answer said squire newcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont know what categorical means said ben assuming a perplexed look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i desire you to answer me immegiately explained the squire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was tying a tinkettle to his tail said ben a little reluctantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what was you a doing that for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to see how he would look said ben glancing demurely at his father out of the corner of his eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did it ever occur to you that it must be disagreeable to watch to have such an appendage to his tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how should you like to have a tin pail suspended to yourahem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent got any coat tail said ben i wear jackets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i think i am old enough to wear coats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the squire blowing his nose we will speak of that at some future period <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred newell wears a coat and he isnt any older than i am persisted ben who was desirous of interrupting his fathers inquiries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i apprehend that we are wandering from the question said the squire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you like to be treated as you treated watch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said ben slowly i dont know as i should <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then take care not to repeat your conduct of this morning said his father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stay a moment as ben was about to leave the room hastily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i desire that you should go to the postoffice and inquire for letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben left the room and sauntered out in the direction of the postoffice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a chaise driven by a stranger stopped as it came up with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the driver looked towards ben and inquired boy is this the way to sparta <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben who was walking leisurely along the path whistling as he went never turned his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to know if this is the road to sparta <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know that well enough without your telling me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you tell me whether this is the road to sparta <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben put his hand to his ear and seemed to listen attentively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but remember it may seem to you a very roundabout way indeed and you must not doubt the thread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of one thing you may be it is very wonderful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here have i been sitting all this time in your sit down again irene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing pleases me better than to see anyone sit in my chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am only too glad to stand so long as how kind of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but said irene still puzzled wont the thread get in somebodys way and be broken if the one end is fast to my ring you will find all that arrange itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid it is time for mightnt i stay and sleep with you tonight grandmother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had meant you to stay tonight i should have given you a bath but you know everybody in the house is miserable about you and it would be cruel to keep them so all im so glad grandmother you didnt say go home for this is my you may my child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i trust you will always think it your please i want to ask you one question more said irene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it no child answered her grandmother it is because i felt so young this evening that i put my crown on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i thought you would i am very old indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is so silly of people i dont mean you for you are such a tiny and couldnt know better but it is so silly of people to fancy that old age means crookedness and witheredness and feebleness and sticks and spectacles and rheumatism and forgetfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old age has nothing whatever to do with all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the right old age means strength and beauty and mirth and courage and clear eyes and strong painless and look at you grandmother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried irene jumping up and flinging her arms about her neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont be so silly again i promise you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least im rather afraid to promise but if i am i promise to be sorry for it i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i were as old as not for long at least my child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps by the time i am two thousand years of age i shall indeed never be afraid of anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i confess i have sometimes been afraid about my yes a little tonight but a good deal when you had all but made up your mind that i was a dream and no real greatgreatgrandmother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must not suppose i am blaming you for i dont know grandmother said the princess beginning to cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant always do myself as i should like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i dont always the lady stooped lifted her in her arms and sat down with her in her chair holding her close to her bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few minutes the princess had sobbed herself to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long she slept i do not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she came to herself she was sitting in her own high chair at the nursery table with her dolls house before her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter the same moment her nurse came into the room sobbing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she saw her sitting there she started back with a loud cry of amazement and joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then running to her she caught her in her arms and covered her with kisses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve all been crying our eyes out and searching not quite from the top thought irene to herself and she might have added not quite to the bottom perhaps if she had known all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the one she would not and the other she could not say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she replied and told her all about the cat with the long legs and how she ran out upon the mountain and came back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she said nothing of her grandmother or her lamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there weve been searching for you all over the house for more than an hour and a half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but thats no matter now weve got you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marriages they say are made in heaven how much more these pure alborious intellectual fellowships born to found empires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found each other ripe filled with great ideas that took shape and clarified with every word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we grew together ay madam in mind we grew together like twin children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all of my life until we met was petty and groping was it not i will flatter myself openly it was the same with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not till then had you those eagle surveys that wide and hopeful sweep of it is true she cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yours is the genius your generosity confounds your insight all i could offer you was the position was this throne to be a fulcrum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i offered it without reserve i entered at least warmly into all your thoughts you were sure of me sure of my support certain of justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell nay madam he said you made me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as we prepared our policy weighing every step how often have i had to admire your perspicacity your manlike diligence and fortitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know that these are not the words of flattery your conscience echoes them have you spared a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young and beautiful you have lived a life of high intellectual effort of irksome intellectual patience with details <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you have your reward what thought have you in your mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is not all nay my princess the same thought is in both our minds he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herr von gondremark she replied by all that i hold sacred i you are looking at the passionate side of a rich nature misunderstood and recently insulted said the baron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look into i find nothing nothing but tumult she replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you find one word branded madam returned the baron o <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaves me to bear all and in the hour of trial he stabs me from behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing in him not respect not love not courage his wife his dignity his throne yes pursued the baron the word abdication <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i perceive a i read your fancy she returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they such is the gratitude of peoples said the baron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man who in the hour of danger speaks of abdication is for me a venomous animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i speak with the bluntness of gravity madam this is no hour for mincing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coward in a station of authority is more dangerous than fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dwell on a volcano if this man can have his way grunewald before a week will have been deluged with innocent blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know the truth of what i say we have looked unblenching into this ever possible catastrophe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to him it is nothing he will abdicate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this unhappy country committed to his charge and the lives of men and the honour of women his voice appeared to fail him in an instant he had conquered his emotion and resumed but you madam conceive more worthily of your responsibilities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am with you in the thought and in the face of the horrors that i see impending i say and your heart repeats it we have gone too far to pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> honour duty ay and the care of she was looking at him her brow thoughtfully knitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the power is in the army he replied and then hastily ere she could intervene we have to save ourselves he went on i have to save my princess she has to save her minister we have both of us to save this infatuated youth from his own madness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he in the outbreak would be the earliest victim i see him he cried torn in pieces and grunewald unhappy grunewald <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay madam you who have the power must use it it lies hard upon show me how <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose i were to place him under some the baron feigned defeat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet there should there must be some way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she said i told you from the first there is no remedy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our hopes are lost lost by one miserable trifler ignorant fretful fitful who will have disappeared tomorrow who knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his any peg would do for gondremark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he appeared to collect himself and then with a smile the and stay there echoed the baron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so significantly said that her face changed and the schemer fearful of the sinister ambiguity of his expressions hastened to explain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time he shall go hunting in a carriage with a good escort of our foreign lancers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his destination shall be the felsenburg it is healthy the rock is high the windows are small and barred it might have been built on purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall intrust the captaincy to the scotsman gordon he at least will have no scruple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is gone hunting he came home on tuesday on thursday he returned all is usual in that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile the war proceeds our prince will soon weary of his solitude and about the time of our triumph or if he prove very obstinate a little later he shall be released upon a proper understanding and i see him once seraphina sat gloomy plunged in thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she said suddenly it cannot pass the council before friday replied gondremark and as for any private note the messengers are all at my disposal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she can project herself into my body and take command of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has a parasite soul yes she is a parasite a monstrous parasite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she creeps into my frame as the hermit crab does into the whelks shell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am dealing with forces of which i know nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i can tell no one of my trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would set me down as a madman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly if it got noised abroad the university would say that they had no need of a devilridden professor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i read over my notes of what the woman said when she spoke about her powers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is one point which fills me with dismay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she implies that when the influence is slight the subject knows what he is doing but cannot control himself whereas when it is strongly exerted he is absolutely unconscious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i have always known what i did though less so last night than on the previous occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that seems to mean that she has never yet exerted her full powers upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes perhaps there was and very near me too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his vague words of warning take a meaning now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh if i had only listened to him then before i helped by these repeated sittings to forge the links of the chain which binds me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will apologize to him for having treated his warning so lightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will see if he can advise me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have talked with him and he showed such surprise at the first words in which i tried to express my unspeakable secret that i went no further <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as far as i can gather by hints and inferences rather than by any statement his own experience was limited to some words or looks such as i have myself endured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the priest knelt before him and received his hands on his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i knew that to the confusion of all talk about equality god has ordained some men to be kings and others to serve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laputa stood naked as when he was born the rubies were dulled against the background of his skin but they still shone with a dusky fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above the bloodred collar his face had the passive pride of a roman emperor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only his great eyes gloomed and burned as he looked on his followers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heir of john he said i stand before you as priest and king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i am the priest to he prayed prayed as i never heard man pray before and to the god of israel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was no heathen fetich he was invoking but the god of whom he had often preached in christian kirks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i recognized texts from isaiah and the psalms and the gospels and very especially from the two last chapters of revelation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pled with god to forget the sins of his people to recall the bondage of zion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was amazing to hear these bloodthirsty savages consecrated by their leader to the meek service of christ <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an enthusiast may deceive himself and i did not question his sincerity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew his heart black with all the lusts of paganism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that his purpose was to deluge the land with blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i knew also that in his eyes his mission was divine and that he felt behind him all the armies of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou hast been a strength to the poor said the voice a refuge from the storm a shadow from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against a wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers as the heat in a dry place the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in this mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the lees of fat things full of marrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the vail that is brought over all nations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all i listened spellbound as he prayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard the phrases familiar to me in my schooldays at kirkcaple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had some of the tones of my fathers voice and when i shut my eyes i could have believed myself a child again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so much he had got from his apprenticeship to the ministry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered vaguely what the good folks who had listened to him in churches and halls at home would think of him now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was in the prayer more than the supplications of the quondam preacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a tone of arrogant pride the pride of the man to whom the almighty is only another and greater lord of hosts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he prayed less as a suppliant than as an ally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a strange emotion tingled in my blood half awe half sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i have said i understood that there are men born to kingship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he put on his leopard skin cloak and kilt and received from the kneeling chief a spear and shield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he was more king than priest more barbarian than christian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as a king that he now spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had heard him on board the liner and had thought his voice the most wonderful i had ever met with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now in that great resonant hall the magic of it was doubled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he played upon the souls of his hearers as on a musical instrument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at will he struck the chords of pride fury hate and mad joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now they would be hushed in breathless quiet and now the place would echo with savage assent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember noticing that the face of my neighbour mwanga was running with tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke of the great days of prester john and a hundred names i had never heard of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pictured the heroic age of his nation when every man was a warrior and hunter and rich kraals stood in the spots now desecrated by the white man and cattle wandered on a thousand hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he told tales of white infamy lands snatched from their rightful possessors unjust laws which forced the ethiopian to the bondage of a despised caste the finger of scorn everywhere and the mocking word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it be the part of an orator to rouse the passion of his hearers laputa was the greatest on earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what have ye gained from the white man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a bastard civilization which has sapped your manhood a false religion which would rivet on you the chains of the slave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye the old masters of the land are now the servants of the oppressor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet the oppressors are few and the fear of you is in their hearts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they feast in their great cities but they see the writing on the wall and their eyes are anxiously turning lest the enemy be at their gates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot hope in my prosaic words to reproduce that amazing discourse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phrases which the hearers had heard at mission schools now suddenly appeared not as the white mans learning but as gods message to his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laputa fitted the key to the cipher and the meaning was clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he concluded i remember with a picture of the overthrow of the alien and the golden age which would dawn for the oppressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another ethiopian empire would arise so majestic that the white man everywhere would dread its name so righteous that all men under it would live in ease and peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by rights i suppose my blood should have been boiling at this treason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am ashamed to confess that it did nothing of the sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mind was mesmerized by this amazing man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not refrain from shouting with the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed i was a convert if there can be conversion when the emotions are dominant and there is no assent from the brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a mad desire to be of laputas party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or rather i longed for a leader who should master me and make my soul his own as this man mastered his followers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have already said that i might have made a good subaltern soldier and the proof is that i longed for such a general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the voice ceased there was a deep silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hearers were in a sort of trance their eyes fixed glassily on laputas face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the quiet of tense nerves and imagination at white heat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to struggle with a spell which gripped me equally with the wildest savage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forced myself to look round at the strained faces the wall of the cascade the line of torches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the sight of henriques that broke the charm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was one who had no part in the emotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i caught his eye fixed on the rubies and in it i read only a devouring greed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it flashed through my mind that laputa had a foe in his own camp and the presters collar a votary whose passion was not that of worship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next thing i remember was a movement among the first ranks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laputa took off the collar and called god to witness that it should never again encircle his neck till he had led his people to victory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then one by one the great chiefs and indunas advanced and swore allegiance with their foreheads on the ivory box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a collection of races has never been seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were tall zulus and swazis with ringkops and feather headdresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were men from the north with heavy brass collars and anklets men with quills in their ears and earrings and noserings shaven heads and heads with wonderfully twisted hair bodies naked or all but naked and bodies adorned with skins and necklets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some were light in colour and some were black as coal some had squat negro features and some thin high boned arab faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in all there was the air of mad enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a day they were forsworn from blood but their wild eyes and twitching hands told their future purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an hour or two i had been living in a dreamworld <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly my absorption was shattered for i saw that my time to swear was coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not so strong as i was and the walk from our rooms woul tire me but i think if i rode both ways for the present i shal be able to get along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would like to have you stay with me today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know ho i shall hold out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george barry remained in attendance the rest of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> h found that his strength had so far returned that he should b i am glad you are well again george said paul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must hav been dull work staying at home sick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes it was dull but i felt more comfortable from knowing tha you were taking my place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i get sick again i will send fo you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you wont get sick but if you do i will do what i ca to help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the two parted on the best of terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each had been of servic well said paul to himself i am out of work again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was six oclock and there was nothing to be done till th morrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went slowly homeward revolving this subject in hi mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that he need not remain idle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could blac boots or sell newspapers if nothing better offered and h thought it quite possible that he might adopt the latte business for a few days at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not forgotten mr prestons injunction to let him know when he got out of business but as the second half dozen shirts would be ready in three o four days he preferred to wait till then and not make a specia call on mr preston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had considerable independence of feeling and didnt like to put himself in the position of one asking favor though he had no objection to accept one voluntaril well mother he said entering his humble home i am out o business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he was at the stand today but wanted me to stay with hi till this evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry you are out of work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stewart will tak me in as senior partner if i ask him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then perhaps i can get a few scholars in drawing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid not paul unless you have improved a good deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had made up his min for a few days at least to sell newspapers and it wa necessary in this business to begin the day early <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tool dollar with him and invested a part of it in a stock of dailies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he posted himself in printing house square and began to look ou for customers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being an enterprising boy he was sure to mee with fair success in any business which he undertook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i happened that at ten oclock he had sold out his stock of papers it was getting late for morning papers and there was nothin left to do till the issue of the first edition of the afternoo ill go down and see how george barry is getting along though fair said barry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not so strong as i was yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont think i shall stay in this business long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got a chance in philadelphia or i shall have by the firs of the month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mother got a letter yesterday from a cousin of hers who has store on chestnut street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he offers to take me as a clerk an give me ten dollars a week at first and more after a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like to get one like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the screaming had subsided and faces were in a glow and curls in a tangle and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwick after kissing the old lady as before mentioned was standing under the mistletoe looking with a very pleased countenance on all that was passing around him when the young lady with the black eyes after a little whispering with the other young ladies made a sudden dart forward and putting her arm round mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwicks neck saluted him affectionately on the left cheek and before mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwick distinctly knew what was the matter he was surrounded by the whole body and kissed by every one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a pleasant thing to see mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwick in the centre of the group now pulled this way and then that and first kissed on the chin and then on the nose and then on the spectacles and to hear the peals of laughter which were raised on every side but it was a still more pleasant thing to see mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwick blinded shortly afterwards with a silk handkerchief falling up against the wall and scrambling into corners and going through all the mysteries of blindmans buff with the utmost relish for the game until at last he caught one of the poor relations and then had to evade the blindman himself which he did with a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause of all beholders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor relations caught the people who they thought would like it and when the game flagged got caught themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they all tired of blindmans buff there was a great game at snapdragon and when fingers enough were burned with that and all the raisins were gone they sat down by the huge fire of blazing logs to a substantial supper and a mighty bowl of wassail something smaller than an ordinary wash house copper in which the hot apples were hissing and bubbling with a rich look and a jolly sound that were perfectly irresistible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwick looking round him this is indeed comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody sits down with us on christmas eve as you see them nowservants and all and here we wait until the clock strikes twelve to usher christmas in and beguile the time with forfeits and old stories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up flew the bright sparks in myriads as the logs were stirred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deep red blaze sent forth a rich glow that penetrated into the farthest corner of the room and cast its cheerful tint on every face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be two hours good before you see the bottom of the bowl through the deep rich colour of the thus saying the merry old gentleman in a good round i care not for spring on his fickle wing let the blossoms and buds be borne he woos them amain with his treacherous rain and he scatters them ere the morn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an inconstant elf he knows not himself nor his own changing mind an hour hell smile in your face and with wry grimace hell wither your youngest flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let the summer sun to his bright home run he shall never be sought by me when hes dimmed by a cloud i can laugh aloud and care not how sulky he be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for his darling child is the madness wild that sports in fierce fevers train and when love is too strong it dont last long as many have found to their pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mild harvest night by the tranquil light of the modest and gentle moon has a far sweeter sheen for me i ween than the broad and unblushing noon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but every leaf awakens my grief as it lieth beneath the tree so let autumn air be never so fair it by no means agrees with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my song i troll out for christmas stout the hearty the true and the bold a bumper i drain and with might and main give three cheers for this christmas old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well usher him in with a merry din that shall gladden his joyous heart and well keep him up while theres bite or sup and in fellowship good well part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his fine honest pride he scorns to hide one jot of his hardweather scars theyre no disgrace for theres much the same trace on the cheeks of our bravest tars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then again i sing till the roof doth ring and it echoes from wall to wall to the stout old wight fair welcome tonight this song was tumultuously applaudedfor friends and dependents make a capital audienceand the poor relations especially were in perfect ecstasies of rapture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again was the fire replenished and again went the wassail round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said one of the men in a low tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rough cold night sir replied the man and theres a wind what does jem say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there aint no no mother replied wardle he says theres a snowdrift and a wind thats piercing cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should know that by the way ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the old lady there was just such a wind and just such a fall of snow a good many years back i recollectjust five years before your poor father died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a christmas eve too and i remember that on that very night he told us the story the story about what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about an old sexton that the good people down here suppose to have been carried suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there anybody hardy enough to disbelieve it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> havent you heard ever since you were a child that he was carried away by the goblins and very well mother he was if you like said wardle laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was carried away by goblins pickwick and theres an end no no said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwick not an end of it i assure you for wardle smiled as every head was bent forward to hear and filling out the wassail with no stinted hand nodded a health to but bless our editorial heart what a long chapter we have been betrayed into <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had quite forgotten all such petty restrictions as chapters we solemnly declare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so here goes to give the goblin a fair start in a new one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a clear stage and no favour for the goblins ladies and gentlemen if you please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xxix in an old abbey town down in this part of the country a long long while agoso long that the story must be a true one because our greatgrandfathers implicitly believed itthere officiated as sexton and gravedigger in the churchyard one gabriel grub <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it by no means follows that because a man is a sexton and constantly surrounded by the emblems of mortality therefore he should be a morose and melancholy man your undertakers are the merriest fellows in the world and i once had the honour of being on intimate terms with a mute who in private life and off duty was as comical and jocose a little fellow as ever chirped out a devilmaycare song without a hitch in his memory or drained off a good stiff glass without stopping for breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but notwithstanding these precedents to the contrary gabriel grub was an illconditioned crossgrained surly fellowa morose and lonely man who consorted with nobody but himself and an old wicker bottle which fitted into his large deep waistcoat pocketand who eyed each merry face as it passed him by with such a deep scowl of malice and illhumour as it was difficult to meet without feeling something the worse for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little before twilight one christmas eve gabriel shouldered his spade lighted his lantern and betook himself towards the old churchyard for he had got a grave to finish by next morning and feeling very low he thought it might raise his spirits perhaps if he went on with his work at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he went his way up the ancient street he saw the cheerful light of the blazing fires gleam through the old casements and heard the loud laugh and the cheerful shouts of those who were assembled around them he marked the bustling preparations for next days cheer and smelled the numerous savoury odours consequent thereupon as they steamed up from the kitchen windows in clouds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this was gall and wormwood to the heart of gabriel grub and when groups of children bounded out of the houses tripped across the road and were met before they could knock at the opposite door by half a dozen curlyheaded little rascals who crowded round them as they flocked upstairs to spend the evening in their christmas games gabriel smiled grimly and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp as he thought of measles scarlet fever thrush whoopingcough and a good many other sources of consolation besides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this happy frame of mind gabriel strode along returning a short sullen growl to the goodhumoured greetings of such of his neighbours as now and then passed him until he turned into the dark lane which led to the churchyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now gabriel had been looking forward to reaching the dark lane because it was generally speaking a nice gloomy mournful place into which the townspeople did not much care to go except in broad daylight and when the sun was shining consequently he was not a little indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about a merry christmas in this very sanctuary which had been called coffin lane ever since the days of the old abbey and the time of the shavenheaded monks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as gabriel walked on and the voice drew nearer he found it proceeded from a small boy who was hurrying along to join one of the little parties in the old street and who partly to keep himself company and partly to prepare himself for the occasion was shouting out the song at the highest pitch of his lungs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so gabriel waited until the boy came up and then dodged him into a corner and rapped him over the head with his lantern five or six times just to teach him to modulate his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as the boy hurried away with his hand to his head singing quite a different sort of tune gabriel grub chuckled very heartily to himself and entered the churchyard locking the gate behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took off his coat set down his lantern and getting into the unfinished grave worked at it for an hour or so with right good will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the earth was hardened with the frost and it was no very easy matter to break it up and shovel it out and although there was a moon it was a very young one and shed little light upon the grave which was in the shadow of the church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any other time these obstacles would have made gabriel grub very moody and miserable but he was so well pleased with having stopped the small boys singing that he took little heed of the scanty progress he had made and looked down into the grave when he had finished work for the night with grim satisfaction brave lodgings for one brave lodgings for one a few feet of cold earth when life is done a stone at the head a stone at the feet a rich juicy meal for the worms to eat rank grass overhead and damp clay around brave lodgings for one these in holy ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laughed gabriel grub as he sat himself down on a flat tombstone which was a favourite restingplace of his and drew forth his wicker bottle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeated a voice which sounded close behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabriel paused in some alarm in the act of raising the wicker bottle to his lips and looked round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bottom of the oldest grave about him was not more still and quiet than the churchyard in the pale moonlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cold hoar frost glistened on the tombstones and sparkled like rows of gems among the stone carvings of the old church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the snow lay hard and crisp upon the ground and spread over the thicklystrewn mounds of earth so white and smooth a cover that it seemed as if corpses lay there hidden only by their winding sheets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the faintest rustle broke the profound tranquillity of the solemn scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sound itself appeared to be frozen up all was so cold and still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the echoes said gabriel grub raising the bottle to his lips again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabriel started up and stood rooted to the spot with astonishment and terror for his eyes rested on a form that made his blood run cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seated on an upright tombstone close to him was a strange unearthly figure whom gabriel felt at once was no being of this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his long fantastic legs which might have reached the ground were cocked up and crossed after a quaint fantastic fashion his sinewy arms were bare and his hands rested on his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his short round body he wore a close covering ornamented with small slashes a short cloak dangled at his back the collar was cut into curious peaks which served the goblin in lieu of ruff or neckerchief and his shoes curled up at his toes into long points <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his head he wore a broadbrimmed sugarloaf hat garnished with a single feather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hat was covered with the white frost and the goblin looked as if he had sat on the same tombstone very comfortably for two or three hundred years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sitting perfectly still his tongue was put out as if in derision and he was grinning at gabriel grub with such a grin as only a goblin could call up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not the echoes said the goblin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabriel grub was paralysed and could make no reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you do here on christmas eve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came to dig a grave sir stammered gabriel grub <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what man wanders among graves and churchyards on such a night as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> screamed a wild chorus of voices that seemed to fill the churchyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabriel looked fearfully roundnothing was to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hollands sir replied the sexton trembling more than ever for he had bought it of the smugglers and he thought that perhaps his questioner might be in the excise department of the goblins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who drinks hollands alone and in a churchyard on such a night as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the goblin leered maliciously at the terrified sexton and then and who then is our fair and lawful prize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this inquiry the invisible chorus replied in a strain that sounded like the voices of many choristers singing to the mighty swell of the old church organa strain that seemed borne to the sextons ears upon a wild wind and to die away as it passed onward but the burden of the reply was still the same gabriel grub <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the goblin grinned a broader grin than before as he said well gabriel what do you say to this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the goblin kicking up his feet in the air on either side of the tombstone and looking at the turnedup points with as much complacency as if he had been contemplating the most fashionable pair of wellingtons in all bond street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itsitsvery curious sir replied the sexton half dead with fright very curious and very pretty but i think ill go back and finish my work sir if you please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grave sir making the grave stammered the sexton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the goblin who makes graves at a time when all other men are merry and takes a pleasure in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid my friends want you gabriel said the goblin thrusting his tongue farther into his cheek than everand a most astonishing tongue it wasim afraid my friends want you gabriel said the goblin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under favour sir replied the horrorstricken sexton i dont think they can sir they dont know me sir i dont think the gentlemen have ever seen me sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes they have replied the goblin we know the man with the sulky face and grim scowl that came down the street tonight throwing his evil looks at the children and grasping his buryingspade the tighter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know the man who struck the boy in the envious malice of his heart because the boy could be merry and he could not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the goblin gave a loud shrill laugh which the echoes returned twentyfold and throwing his legs up in the air stood upon his head or rather upon the very point of his sugarloaf hat on the narrow edge of the tombstone whence he threw a somerset with extraordinary agility right to the sextons feet at which he planted himself in the attitude in which tailors generally sit upon the shopboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iiam afraid i must leave you sir said the sexton making an effort to move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the goblin gabriel grub going to leave us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the goblin laughed the sexton observed for one instant a brilliant illumination within the windows of the church as if the whole building were lighted up it disappeared the organ pealed forth a lively air and whole troops of goblins the very counterpart of the first one poured into the churchyard and began playing at leapfrog with the tombstones never stopping for an instant to take breath but overing the highest among them one after the other with the most marvellous dexterity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first goblin was a most astonishing leaper and none of the others could come near him even in the extremity of his terror the sexton could not help observing that while his friends were content to leap over the commonsized gravestones the first one took the family vaults iron railings and all with as much ease as if they had been so many streetposts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the game reached to a most exciting pitch the organ played quicker and quicker and the goblins leaped faster and faster coiling themselves up rolling head over heels upon the ground and bounding over the tombstones like footballs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sextons brain whirled round with the rapidity of the motion he beheld and his legs reeled beneath him as the spirits flew before his eyes when the goblin king suddenly darting towards him laid his hand upon his collar and sank with him through the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when gabriel grub had had time to fetch his breath which the rapidity of his descent had for the moment taken away he found himself in what appeared to be a large cavern surrounded on all sides by crowds of goblins ugly and grim in the centre of the room on an elevated seat was stationed his friend of the churchyard and close behind him stood gabriel grub himself without power of motion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cold tonight said the king of the goblins very cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this command half a dozen officious goblins with a perpetual smile upon their faces whom gabriel grub imagined to be courtiers on that account hastily disappeared and presently returned with a goblet of liquid fire which they presented to the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the goblin whose cheeks and throat were transparent as he tossed down the flame this warms one indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bring a bumper of the same for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in vain for the unfortunate sexton to protest that he was not in the habit of taking anything warm at night one of the goblins held him while another poured the blazing liquid down his throat the whole assembly screeched with laughter as he coughed and choked and wiped away the tears which gushed plentifully from his eyes after swallowing the burning draught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now said the king fantastically poking the taper corner of his sugarloaf hat into the sextons eye and thereby occasioning him the most exquisite pain and now show the man of misery and gloom a few of the pictures from our own great storehouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the goblin said this a thick cloud which obscured the remoter end of the cavern rolled gradually away and disclosed apparently at a great distance a small and scantily furnished but neat and clean apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a crowd of little children were gathered round a bright fire clinging to their mothers gown and gambolling around her chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother occasionally rose and drew aside the windowcurtain as if to look for some expected object a frugal meal was ready spread upon the table and an elbow chair was placed near the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a knock was heard at the door the mother opened it and the children crowded round her and clapped their hands for joy as their father entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was wet and weary and shook the snow from his garments as the children crowded round him and seizing his cloak hat stick and gloves with busy zeal ran with them from the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as he sat down to his meal before the fire the children climbed about his knee and the mother sat by his side and all seemed happiness and comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a change came upon the view almost imperceptibly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scene was altered to a small bedroom where the fairest and youngest child lay dying the roses had fled from his cheek and the light from his eye and even as the sexton looked upon him with an interest he had never felt or known before he died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his young brothers and sisters crowded round his little bed and seized his tiny hand so cold and heavy but they shrank back from its touch and looked with awe on his infant face for calm and tranquil as it was and sleeping in rest and peace as the beautiful child seemed to be they saw that he was dead and they knew that he was an angel looking down upon and blessing them from a bright and happy heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again the light cloud passed across the picture and again the subject changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the father and mother were old and helpless now and the number of those about them was diminished more than half but content and cheerfulness sat on every face and beamed in every eye as they crowded round the fireside and told and listened to old stories of earlier and bygone days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly and peacefully the father sank into the grave and soon after the sharer of all his cares and troubles followed him to a place of rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the few who yet survived them kneeled by their tomb and watered the green turf which covered it with their tears then rose and turned away sadly and mournfully but not with bitter cries or despairing lamentations for they knew that they should one day meet again and once more they mixed with the busy world and their content and cheerfulness were restored <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cloud settled upon the picture and concealed it from the sextons view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the goblin turning his large face towards gabriel grub <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabriel murmured out something about its being very pretty and looked somewhat ashamed as the goblin bent his fiery eyes upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the goblin in a tone of excessive contempt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he appeared disposed to add more but indignation choked his utterance so he lifted up one of his very pliable legs and flourishing it above his head a little to insure his aim administered a good sound kick to gabriel grub immediately after which all the goblins in waiting crowded round the wretched sexton and kicked him without mercy according to the established and invariable custom of courtiers upon earth who kick whom royalty kicks and hug whom royalty hugs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at these words the cloud was dispelled and a rich and beautiful landscape was disclosed to viewthere is just such another to this day within half a mile of the old abbey town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun shone from out the clear blue sky the water sparkled beneath his rays and the trees looked greener and the flowers more gay beneath its cheering influence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water rippled on with a pleasant sound the trees rustled in the light wind that murmured among their leaves the birds sang upon the boughs and the lark carolled on high her welcome to the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes it was morning the bright balmy morning of summer the minutest leaf the smallest blade of grass was instinct with life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ant crept forth to her daily toil the butterfly fluttered and basked in the warm rays of the sun myriads of insects spread their transparent wings and revelled in their brief but happy existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> man walked forth elated with the scene and all was brightness and splendour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the king of the goblins in a more contemptuous tone than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and again the king of the goblins gave his leg a flourish again it descended on the shoulders of the sexton and again the attendant goblins imitated the example of their chief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many a time the cloud went and came and many a lesson it taught to gabriel grub who although his shoulders smarted with pain from the frequent applications of the goblins feet thereunto looked on with an interest that nothing could diminish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw that men who worked hard and earned their scanty bread with lives of labour were cheerful and happy and that to the most ignorant the sweet face of nature was a neverfailing source of cheerfulness and joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw those who had been delicately nurtured and tenderly brought up cheerful under privations and superior to suffering that would have crushed many of a rougher grain because they bore within their own bosoms the materials of happiness contentment and peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw that women the tenderest and most fragile of all gods creatures were the oftenest superior to sorrow adversity and distress and he saw that it was because they bore in their own hearts an inexhaustible wellspring of affection and devotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above all he saw that men like himself who snarled at the mirth and cheerfulness of others were the foulest weeds on the fair surface of the earth and setting all the good of the world against the evil he came to the conclusion that it was a very decent and respectable sort of world after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner had he formed it than the cloud which had closed over the last picture seemed to settle on his senses and lull him to repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one by one the goblins faded from his sight and as the last one disappeared he sank to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day had broken when gabriel grub awoke and found himself lying at full length on the flat gravestone in the churchyard with the wicker bottle lying empty by his side and his coat spade and lantern all well whitened by the last nights frost scattered on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stone on which he had first seen the goblin seated stood bolt upright before him and the grave at which he had worked the night before was not far off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first he began to doubt the reality of his adventures but the acute pain in his shoulders when he attempted to rise assured him that the kicking of the goblins was certainly not ideal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was staggered again by observing no traces of footsteps in the snow on which the goblins had played at leapfrog with the gravestones but he speedily accounted for this circumstance when he remembered that being spirits they would leave no visible impression behind them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so gabriel grub got on his feet as well as he could for the pain in his back and brushing the frost off his coat put it on and turned his face towards the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was an altered man and he could not bear the thought of returning to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at and his reformation disbelieved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hesitated for a few moments and then turned away to wander where he might and seek his bread elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lantern the spade and the wicker bottle were found that day in the churchyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were a great many speculations about the sextons fate at first but it was speedily determined that he had been carried away by the goblins and there were not wanting some very credible witnesses who had distinctly seen him whisked through the air on the back of a chestnut horse blind of one eye with the hindquarters of a lion and the tail of a bear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length all this was devoutly believed and the new sexton used to exhibit to the curious for a trifling emolument a good sized piece of the church weathercock which had been accidentally kicked off by the aforesaid horse in his aerial flight and picked up by himself in the churchyard a year or two afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unfortunately these stories were somewhat disturbed by the unlookedfor reappearance of gabriel grub himself some ten years afterwards a ragged contented rheumatic old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told his story to the clergyman and also to the mayor and in course of time it began to be received as a matter of history in which form it has continued down to this very day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the believers in the weathercock tale having misplaced their confidence once were not easily prevailed upon to part with it again so they looked as wise as they could shrugged their shoulders touched their foreheads and murmured something about gabriel grub having drunk all the hollands and then fallen asleep on the flat tombstone and they affected to explain what he supposed he had witnessed in the goblins cavern by saying that he had seen the world and grown wiser <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this opinion which was by no means a popular one at any time gradually died off and be the matter how it may as gabriel grub was afflicted with rheumatism to the end of his days this story has at least one moral if it teach no better oneand that is that if a man turn sulky and drink by himself at christmas time he may make up his mind to be not a bit the better for it let the spirits be never so good or let them be even as many degrees chapter xxx how the pickwickians made and cultivated the acquaintance of a couple of nice young men belonging to one of the liberal professions how they disported themselves on the ice and how well sam said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwick as that favoured servitor entered his bedchamber with his warm water on the morning of christmas water in the washhand basins a mask o ice sir responded sam <end> <end>

<start> <start> pickwick at the expiration of the quarter of an hour went down to breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben we call him and so may you if you like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwick bowed to bob sawyer and bob sawyer bowed to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bob and his very particular friend then applied themselves most assiduously to the eatables before them and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwick had an opportunity of glancing at them both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> benjamin allen was a coarse stout thickset young man with black hair cut rather short and a white face cut rather long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been taking the morning post for some time now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have got me a good many odd numbers of the less base society papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant for the life of me see what youre driving at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raffles smiled indulgently as he cracked another nut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats because youve neither observation nor imagination bunnyand yet you try to write <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you wouldnt think it but i have a fairly complete list of the people who were at the various functions under cover of which these different little coups were brought off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said very stolidly that i did not see how that could help him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the only answer to his goodhumored but selfsatisfied contempt it happened also to be true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when thieves break in and steal said i upstairs i dont see much point in discovering who was downstairs at the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but thats what they have done in all these cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an upstairs door found screwed up when things were at their height below thief gone and jewels with him before alarm could be raised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the tricks so old that i never knew you condescend to play it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not so old as it looks said raffles choosing the cigars and handing me mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides he went on the rooms were not screwed up at dorchester house at any rate the door was only locked and the key missing so that it might have been done on either side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that was where he left his ropeladder behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i exclaimed in triumph but raffles only shook his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe in that ropeladder bunny except as a blind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that every one of these socalled burglaries has been done from the inside by one of the guests and whats more im very much mistaken if i havent spotted the right sportsman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to believe that he really had there was such a wicked gravity in the eyes that twinkled faintly into mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i raised my glass in convivial congratulation and still remember the somewhat anxious eye with which raffles saw it emptied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can only find one likely name he continued that figures in all these lists and it is anything but a likely one at first sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord ernest belville was at all those functions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite said raffles and yet what could be more promising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man whose views are so broad and moderate and so widely held already saving your presence bunny does not bore the world with them without ulterior motives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary hes as poor as a rat for his position and apparently without the least ambition to be anything else certainly he wont enrich himself by making a public fad of what all sensible people are agreed upon as it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly one gets ones own old ideathe alternative profession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is no use jumping to conclusions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must know more than the newspapers can tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what has he been doing all these years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how the devil was i to find out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked declining to spoil my digestion with a conundrum as it was his evident intention that i should <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last thursday night when if you remember we kept early hours because i felt done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was the use of telling you what i had up my sleeve bunny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might have ended in fizzle as it still may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lord ernest belville was addressing the meeting at exeter hall i waited for him when the show was over dogged him home to king johns mansions and interviewed him in his own rooms there before he turned in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my journalistic jealousy was piqued to the quick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> affecting a scepticism i did not feel for no outrage was beyond the pale of his impudence i inquired dryly which journal raffles had pretended to represent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not believe him without further explanation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have thought he said that even you would have spotted a practice i never omit upon certain occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always pay a visit to the drawingroom and fill my waistcoat pocket from the cardtray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is an immense help in any little temporary impersonation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on thursday night i sent up the card of a powerful writer connected with a powerful paper if lord ernest had known him in the flesh i should have been obliged to confess to a journalistic ruse luckily he didntand i had been sent by my editor to get the interview for next morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i inquired what the interview had brought forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told me frankly enough that his father was a clergyman who would have taught him well but that he will atkins despised all instruction and correction and by his brutish conduct cut the thread of all his fathers comforts and shortened his days for that he broke his heart by the most ungrateful unnatural return for the most affectionate treatment a father ever gave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in what he said there seemed so much sincerity of repentance that it painfully affected me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not but reflect that i too had shortened the life of a good tender father by my bad conduct and obstinate selfwill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was indeed so surprised with what he had told me that i thought instead of my going about to teach and instruct him the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a most unexpected manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i laid all this before the young clergyman who was greatly affected with it and said to me did i not say sir that when this man was converted he would preach to us all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you sir if this one man be made a true penitent there will be no need of me he will make christians of all in the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but having a little composed myself i renewed my discourse with will atkins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but will said i how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir you have set me about a work that has struck a dart though my very soul i have been talking about god and religion to my wife in order as you directed me to make a christian of her and she has preached such a sermon to me as i shall never forget while i live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no it is not your wife has preached to you but when you were moving religious arguments to her conscience has flung them back upon you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay sir with such force as is not to be resisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray will let us know what passed between you and your wife for i know something of it already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir it is impossible to give you a full account of it i am too full to hold it and yet have no tongue to express it but let her have said what she will though i cannot give you an account of it this i can tell you that i have resolved to amend and reform my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tell us some of it how did you begin will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this has been an extraordinary case that is certain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has preached a sermon indeed if she has wrought this upon you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i first told her the nature of our laws about marriage and what the reasons were that men and women were obliged to enter into such compacts as it was neither in the power of one nor other to break that otherwise order and justice could not be maintained and men would run from their wives and abandon their children mix confusedly with one another and neither families be kept entire nor inheritances be settled by legal descent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could you make her understand what you meant by inheritance and families <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they know no such things among the savages but marry anyhow without regard to relation consanguinity or family brother and sister nay as i have been told even the father and the daughter and the son and the mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe sir you are misinformed and my wife assures me of the contrary and that they abhor it perhaps for any further relations they may not be so exact as we are but she tells me never in the near relationship you speak of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well what did she say to what you told her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said she liked it very well as it was much better than in her country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but did you tell her what marriage was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked her if she would be married to me our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked me what way that was i told her marriage was appointed by god and here we had a strange talk together indeed as ever man and wife had i believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this dialogue between will atkins and his wife which i took wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why have you a god in your country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes my dear god is in every country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no your god in my country my country have the great old benamuckee god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> child i am very unfit to show you who god is god is in heaven and made the heaven and the earth the sea and all that in them is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no makee de earth no you god makee all earth no makee my country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will atkins laughed a little at her expression of god not making wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was justly reproved by his wife for she was more serious than wa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats true indeed i will not laugh any more my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes child our god made the whole world and you and me and all things for he is the only true god and there is no god but him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats true indeed but i have been a wicked wretch and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with anything before but have lived without god in the world myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what have you a great god in your country you no know him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true though for all that we live as if there was no god in heaven or that he had no power on earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you say me he is great much great have much great power can makee kill when he will why he no makee kill when you no serve him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is true he might strike me dead and i ought to expect it for i have been a wicked wretch that is true but god is merciful and does not deal with us as we deserve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then do you not tell god thankee for that too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no indeed i have not thanked god for his mercy any more than i have feared god from his power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you god no god me no think believe he be such one great much power strong no makee kill you though you make him much angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what will my wicked life hinder you from believing in god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what a sad truth is it that the horrid lives of christians hinder the conversion of heathens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how me tink you have great much god up there she points up to heaven and yet no do well no do good ting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes yes he knows and sees all things he hears us speak sees what we do knows what we think though we do not speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he no hear you curse swear speak de great damn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where be then the much great power strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a table was here spread for me in the wilderness where i saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my little family sit down to dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was my majesty the prince and lord of the whole island i had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command i could hang draw give liberty and take it away and no rebels among all my subjects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then to see how like a king i dined too all alone attended by my servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poll as if he had been my favourite was the only person permitted to talk to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dog who was now grown old and crazy and had found no species to multiply his kind upon sat always at my right hand and two cats one on one side of the table and one on the other expecting now and then a bit from my hand as a mark of especial favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but these were not the two cats which i brought on shore at first for they were both of them dead and had been interred near my habitation by my own hand but one of them having multiplied by i know not what kind of creature these were two which i had preserved tame whereas the rest ran wild in the woods and became indeed troublesome to me at last for they would often come into my house and plunder me too till at last i was obliged to shoot them and did kill a great many at length they left me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this attendance and in this plentiful manner i lived neither could i be said to want anything but society and of that some time after this i was likely to have too much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was something impatient as i have observed to have the use of my boat though very loath to run any more hazards and therefore sometimes i sat contriving ways to get her about the island and at other times i sat myself down contented enough without her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island where as i have said in my last ramble i went up the hill to see how the shore lay and how the current set that i might see what i had to do this inclination increased upon me every day and at length i resolved to travel thither by land following the edge of the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did so but had any one in england met such a man as i was it must either have frightened him or raised a great deal of laughter and as i frequently stood still to look at myself i could not but smile at the notion of my travelling through yorkshire with such an equipage and in such a dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be pleased to take a sketch of my figure as follows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a great high shapeless cap made of a goats skin with a flap hanging down behind as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from running into my neck nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a short jacket of goats skin the skirts coming down to about the middle of the thighs and a pair of openkneed breeches of the same the breeches were made of the skin of an old hegoat whose hair hung down such a length on either side that like pantaloons it reached to the middle of my legs stockings and shoes i had none but had made me a pair of somethings i scarce knew what to call them like buskins to flap over my legs and lace on either side like spatterdashes but of a most barbarous shape as indeed were all the rest of my clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had on a broad belt of goats skin dried which i drew together with two thongs of the same instead of buckles and in a kind of a frog on either side of this instead of a sword and dagger hung a little saw and a hatchet one on one side and one on the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had another belt not so broad and fastened in the same manner which hung over my shoulder and at the end of it under my left arm hung two pouches both made of goats skin too in one of which hung my powder in the other my shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at my back i carried my basket and on my shoulder my gun and over my head a great clumsy ugly goatsskin umbrella but which after all was the most necessary thing i had about me next to my gun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for my face the colour of it was really not so mulattolike as one might expect from a man not at all careful of it and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my beard i had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long but as i had both scissors and razors sufficient i had cut it pretty short except what grew on my upper lip which i had trimmed into a large pair of mahometan whiskers such as i had seen worn by some turks at sallee for the moors did not wear such though the turks did of these moustachios or whiskers i will not say they were long enough to hang my hat upon them but they were of a length and shape monstrous enough and such as in england would have passed for frightful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but all this is bythebye for as to my figure i had so few to observe me that it was of no manner of consequence so i say no more of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this kind of dress i went my new journey and was out five or six days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i travelled first along the seashore directly to the place where i first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon the rocks and having no boat now to take care of i went over the land a nearer way to the same height that i was upon before when looking forward to the points of the rocks which lay out and which i was obliged to double with my boat as is said above i was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet no rippling no motion no current any more there than in other places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was at a strange loss to understand this and resolved to spend some time in the observing it to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it but i was presently convinced how it was viz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that the tide of ebb setting from the west and joining with the current of waters from some great river on the shore must be the occasion of this current and that according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west or from the north this current came nearer or went farther from the shore for waiting thereabouts till evening i went up to the rock again and then the tide of ebb being made i plainly saw the current again as before only that it ran farther off being near half a league from the shore whereas in my case it set close upon the shore and hurried me and my canoe along with it which at another time it would not have done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this observation convinced me that i had nothing to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide and i might very easily bring my boat about the island again but when i began to think of putting it in practice i had such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger i had been in that i could not think of it again with any patience but on the contrary i took up another resolution which was more safe though more laborious and this was that i would build or rather make me another periagua or canoe and so have one for one side of the island and one for the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are to understand that now i had as i may call it two plantations in the island one my little fortification or tent with the wall about it under the rock with the cave behind me which by this time i had enlarged into several apartments or caves one within another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these which was the driest and largest and had a door out beyond my wall or fortification that is to say beyond where my wall joined to the rock was all filled up with the large earthen pots of which i have given an account and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets which would hold five or six bushels each where i laid up my stores of provisions especially my corn some in the ear cut off short from the straw and the other rubbed out with my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for my wall made as before with long stakes or piles those piles grew all like trees and were by this time grown so big and spread so very much that there was not the least appearance to any ones view of any habitation behind them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near this dwelling of mine but a little farther within the land and upon lower ground lay my two pieces of corn land which i kept duly cultivated and sowed and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season and whenever i had occasion for more corn i had more land adjoining as fit as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides this i had my country seat and i had now a tolerable plantation there also for first i had my little bower as i called it which i kept in repair that is to say i kept the hedge which encircled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height the ladder standing always in the inside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i kept the trees which at first were no more than stakes but were now grown very firm and tall always cut so that they might spread and grow thick and wild and make the more agreeable shade which they did effectually to my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle of this i had my tent always standing being a piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that purpose and which never wanted any repair or renewing and under this i had made me a squab or couch with the skins of the creatures i had killed and with other soft things and a blanket laid on them such as belonged to our seabedding which i had saved and a great watchcoat to cover me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here whenever i had occasion to be absent from my chief seat i took up my country habitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adjoining to this i had my enclosures for my cattle that is to say my goats and i had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was so anxious to see it kept entire lest the goats should break through that i never left off till with infinite labour i had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes and so near to one another that it was rather a pale than a hedge and there was scarce room to put a hand through between them which afterwards when those stakes grew as they all did in the next rainy season made the enclosure strong like a wall indeed stronger than any wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this will testify for me that i was not idle and that i spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support for i considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh milk butter and cheese for me as long as i lived in the place if it were to be forty years and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree that i might be sure of keeping them together which by this method indeed i so effectually secured that when these little stakes began to grow i had planted them so very thick that i was forced to pull some of them up again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though called to the bar both auguste and hippolyte ballet were now men of independent means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the death of their parents whatever jealousy auguste may have felt at the unfair preference which his mother had shown for her younger son had died down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the time of hippolytes death the brothers were on good terms though the more prudent hippolyte disapproved of his elder brothers extravagance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apart from his personal liking for castaing it was a source of comfort to hippolyte in his critical state of health to have as his friend one whose medical knowledge was always at his service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about the middle of august hippolyte on the advice of his doctors went to enghien to take the waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he returned to paris on september and seemed to have benefited greatly by the cure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on tuesday october he saw his sister mme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martignon and her husband he seemed well but said that he was having leeches applied to him by his friend castaing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the wednesday evening his sister saw him again and found him well and with a good appetite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the thursday after a night disturbed by severe attacks of vomiting his condition seemed serious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his brotherinlaw who visited him found that he had taken to his bed his face was swollen his eyes were red <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his sister called in the evening but could not see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the servants told her that her brother was a little better but resting and that he did not wish to be disturbed they said that dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on friday castaing himself called on the martignons and told them that hippolyte had passed a shockingly bad night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame martignon insisted on going to nurse her brother herself but castaing refused positively to let her see him the sight of her he said would be too agitating to the patient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> castaings injunctions she dressed herself in some of the clothes of the servant victoire in the hope that if she went into his bedroom thus disguised hippolyte would not recognise her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but even this subterfuge was forbidden by castaing and mme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martignon had to content herself with listening in an adjoining room for the sound of her brothers voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at eight oclock that evening the martignons learnt that hippolyte was better but at ten oclock they received a message that he was dying and that his brother auguste had been sent for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martignon was prostrated with grief but her husband hastened to his brotherinlaws house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he found castaing who said that the death agony of his friend was so dreadful that he had not the strength to remain in the room with the dying man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another doctor was sent for but at ten oclock the following morning after protracted suffering hippolyte ballet passed away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stated that death was due to pleurisy aggravated by the consumptive condition of the deceased which however serious was not of itself likely to have been so rapidly fatal in its consequences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hippolyte had died leaving a fortune of some francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the previous september he had spoken to the notary lebret a former clerk of his fathers of his intention of making a will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seen that his brother auguste was squandering his share of their inheritance he told lebret that whatever he might leave to auguste should not be placed at his absolute disposal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his servant victoire during his last illness hippolyte had spoken of a will he had made which he wished to destroy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if hippolyte had made such a will did he destroy it before his death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in any case no trace of it was ever found after his death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was presumed to have died intestate and his fortune was divided threequarters of it going to his brother auguste the remaining quarter to his sister mme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the day of hippolytes death auguste ballet wrote from his brothers house to one prignon with great grief i have to tell you that i have just lost my brother i write at the same time to say that i must have francs today if possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am at my poor brothers house from which i am writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prignon did as he was asked but it was two days before the stockbroker sandrie could raise the necessary sum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on october he sold out sufficient of augustes stock to realise francs and the following day gave prignon an order on the bank of france for that amount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same day prignon took the order to auguste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> accompanied by castaing and jean augustes black servant auguste and prignon drove to the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prignons part of the business was at an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said goodbye to auguste outside the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the latter got into his cabriolet carrying the bundle of notes prignon heard him say to castaing there are the francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why had auguste ballet after his brothers death such urgent need of francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the statements of auguste made to other persons are to be believed he had paid the francs which he had raised through prignon to lebret his fathers former clerk who would seem to have acted as legal and financial adviser to his old masters children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martignon had offered lebret francs to preserve a copy of a will made by hippolyte leaving her the bulk of his fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> castaing however had ascertained that lebret would be willing if auguste would outbid his sister and pay francs to destroy the will so that hippolyte dying intestate auguste would take the greater part of his brothers fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> auguste agreed to accept lebrets terms raised the necessary sum and handed over the money to castaing who in turn gave it to lebret who had thereupon destroyed the copy of the will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> castaing according to the evidence of augustes mistress an actress of the name of percillie had spoken in her presence of having himself destroyed one copy of hippolytes will before his death and admitted having arranged with lebret after hippolytes death for the destruction of the other copy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how far was the story told by auguste and repeated in somewhat different shape by castaing to other persons true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no doubt that after the visit to the bank of france with prignon on october auguste and castaing drove together to lebrets office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the negro servant said that on arriving there one of them got out of the cab and went up to lebrets house but which of the two he would not at first say positively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later he swore that it was auguste ballet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever happened on that visit to lebretsand it was the theory of the prosecution that castaing and not auguste had gone up to the officethe same afternoon auguste ballet showed his mistress the seals of the copy of his brothers will which lebret had destroyed and told her that lebret all through the business had refused to deal directly with him and would only act through the intermediary of castaing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did lebret as a fact receive the francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a close examination of his finances showed no trace of such a sum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> castaing on the other hand on october had given a stockbroker a sum of francs to invest in securities on the th of the same month he had lent his mother francs and on the th had given his mistress francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of how this large sum of money had come to castaing at a time when he was practically insolvent he gave various accounts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his final version was that in the will destroyed by auguste hippolyte ballet had left him an income for life equivalent to a capital of francs and that auguste had given him that sum out of respect for his brothers wishes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if that explanation were true it was certainly strange that shortly after his brothers death auguste ballet should have expressed surprise and suspicion to a friend on hearing that castaing had been buying stock to the value of francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had given castaing francs for himself there was no occasion for surprise or suspicion at his investing that auguste had paid out francs to some one in october the state of his finances at his death clearly proved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to the theory of the prosecution auguste believed that he had paid that money to lebret through the intermediary of castaing and not to castaing himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence his surprise at hearing that castaing whom he knew to be impecunious was investing such a sum as francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his honesty and good faith were demonstrated beyond any shadow of a doubt no copy of any will of hippolyte ballet had ever been in his possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but castaing had shown auguste ballet a copy of his brothers will the seals of which auguste had shown to his mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all polyte ballet had made a will leaving the greater part of his property to his sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow or other castaing had got possession of this will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his death castaing had invented the story of mme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martignons bribe to lebret and so persuaded auguste to outbid her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had ingeniously kept auguste and lebret apart by representing lebret as refusing to deal direct with auguste and by these means had secured to his own use the sum of francs which auguste believed was being paid to lebret as the price of his alleged destruction of his brothers will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to lebret and the martignons castaing said that hippolyte had made a will in mme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martignons favour but had destroyed it himself some days before polyte had done so for they feared lest such a will should have provoked resentment against them on the part of auguste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by keeping auguste and lebret apart castaing prevented awkward explanations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the creature raised a shrill cry that brought all of its fellows bounding out of the numerous doors and at once they started in chase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorothy and polly had reached the bridge and crossed it when the scoodlers began throwing their heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the queer missiles struck the shaggy man on his back and nearly knocked him over but he was at the mouth of the cave now so he set down buttonbright and told the boy to run across the bridge to dorothy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the shaggy man turned around and faced his enemies standing just outside the opening and as fast as they threw their heads at him he caught them and tossed them into the black gulf below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the headless bodies of the foremost scoodlers kept the others from running close up but they also threw their heads in an effort to stop the escaping prisoners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shaggy man caught them all and sent them whirling down into the black gulf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among them he noticed the crimson and yellow head of the queen and this he tossed after the others with right good will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently every scoodler of the lot had thrown its head and every head was down in the deep gulf and now the helpless bodies of the creatures were mixed together in the cave and wriggling around in a vain attempt to discover what had become of their heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shaggy man laughed and walked across the bridge to rejoin his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its lucky i learned to play baseball when i was young he remarked for i caught all those heads easily and never missed one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but come along little ones the scoodlers will never bother us or anyone else any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buttonbright was still frightened and kept insisting i dont want to be soup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the victory had been gained so suddenly that the boy could not realize they were free and safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the shaggy man assured him that all danger of their being made into soup was now past as the scoodlers would be unable to eat soup for some time to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so now anxious to get away from the horrid gloomy cave as soon as possible they hastened up the hillside and regained the road just beyond the place where they had first met the scoodlers and you may be sure they were glad to find their feet on the old familiar path again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its getting awful rough walking said dorothy as they trudged along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buttonbright gave a deep sigh and said he was hungry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed all were hungry and thirsty too for they had eaten nothing but the apples since breakfast so their steps lagged and they grew silent and weary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last they slowly passed over the crest of a barren hill and saw before them a line of green trees with a strip of grass at their feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our travelers hot and tired ran forward on beholding this refreshing sight and were not long in coming to the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here they found a spring of pure bubbling water around which the grass was full of wild strawberry plants their pretty red berries ripe and ready to eat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of the trees bore yellow oranges and some russet pears so the hungry adventurers suddenly found themselves provided with plenty to eat and to drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they lost no time in picking the biggest strawberries and ripest oranges and soon had feasted to their hearts content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> walking beyond the line of trees they saw before them a fearful dismal desert everywhere gray sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the edge of this awful waste was a large white sign with black letters neatly painted for the deadly sands will turn any living flesh but no one can reach that beautiful country oh said dorothy when the shaggy man had read the sign aloud ive seen this desert before and its true no one can live who tries to walk upon the sands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we musnt try it answered the shaggy man thoughtfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as we cant go ahead and theres no use going back what shall we do next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure i dont know either added dorothy despondently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish father would come for me sighed the pretty rainbows daughter i would take you all to live upon the rainbow where you could dance along its rays from morning till night without a care or worry of any sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i suppose fathers too busy just now to search the world for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were pretty well kept being rented by a gardener and were large and shady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one place there was a rustic theatre open to the sky the stage a green slope the coulisses three entrances upon a side sweetsmelling leafy screens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mistress moved her bright eyes even there as if she looked to see the face come in upon the scene but all was well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder if you guessed then that when that happened i should tell you that i love you with all prince percinet joyfully took the hand that was given him and for fear the princess should change her mind the wedding was held at once with the greatest splendour and graciosa and percinet gracieuse et percinet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was once upon a time a fisherman who lived hard by a palace and fished for the kings table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day he was out fishing but caught nothing at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let him do what he might with rod and line there was never even so much as a sprat on his hook but when the day was well nigh over a head rose up out of the water and said if you will give me what your wife shows you so the man said yes in a moment and then he caught fish in plenty but when he got home at night and his wife showed him a baby which had just been born and fell aweeping and wailing when he told her of the promise which he had given he was very unhappy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this was soon told to the king up at the palace and when he heard what sorrow the woman was in and the reason of it he said that he himself would take the child and see if he could not save it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baby was a boy and the king took him at once and brought him up as his own son until the lad grew up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then one day he begged to have leave to go out with his father to fish he had a strong desire to do this he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king was very unwilling to permit it but at last the lad got leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stayed with his father and all went prosperously and well with them the whole day until they came back to land in the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the lad found that he had lost his pockethandkerchief and would go out in the boat after it but no sooner had he got into the boat than it began to move off with him so quickly that the water foamed all round about and all that the lad did to keep the boat back with the oars was done to no purpose for it went on and on the whole night through and at last he came to a white strand that lay far far away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he landed and when he had walked on for some distance he met an old man with a long white beard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whiteland answered the man and then he begged the youth to tell him whence he came and what he was going to do and the youth did so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then said the man if you walk on farther along the seashore here you will come to three princesses who are standing in the earth so that their heads alone are out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the first of them will call youshe is the eldestand will beg you very prettily to come to her and help her and the second will do the same but you must not go near either of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hurry past as if you neither saw nor heard them but you shall go to the third and do what when the youth came to the first princess she called to him and begged him to come to her very prettily but he walked on as if he did not even see her and he passed by the second in the same way but he went up to the third <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if thou wilt do what i tell thee thou shalt choose among us three said the princess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the lad said that he was most willing and she told him that three trolls had planted them all three there in the earth but that formerly they had dwelt in the castle which he could see at some distance in the wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now she said thou shalt go into the castle and let the trolls beat thee one night for each of us and if thou canst but endure when thou goest in continued the princess two lions will stand by the doorway but if thou only goest straight between them they will do thee no harm go straight forward into a small dark chamber there thou shalt lie down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the troll will come and beat thee but thou shalt take the flask which is hanging on the wall and anoint thyself wheresoever he has wounded thee after which thou shalt be as well as before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then lay hold of the sword so he did what the princess had told him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked straight in between the lions just as if he did not see them and then into the small chamber and lay down on the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first night a troll came with three heads and three rods and beat the lad most unmercifully but he held out until the troll was done with him and then he took the flask and rubbed himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having done this he grasped the sword and smote the troll dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning when he went to the seashore the princesses were out of the earth as far as their waists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next night everything happened in the same way but the troll who came then had six heads and six rods and he beat him much more severely than the first had done but when the lad went out of doors next morning the princesses were out of the earth as far as their knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the third night a troll came who had nine heads and nine rods and he struck the lad and flogged him so long that at last he swooned away so the troll took him up and flung him against the wall and this made the flask of ointment fall down and it splashed all over him and he became as strong as ever again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then without loss of time he grasped the sword and struck the troll dead and in the morning when he went out of the castle the princesses were standing there entirely out of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he took the youngest for his queen and lived with her very happily for a long time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last however he took a fancy to go home for a short time to see his parents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his queen did not like this but when his longing grew so great that he told her he must and would go she said to one thing shalt thou promise me and that is to do what thy father bids thee but not what thy mother bids thee and this he promised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she gave him a ring which enabled him who wore it to obtain two wishes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wished himself at home and instantly found himself there but his parents were so amazed at the splendour of his apparel that their wonder never ceased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had been at home for some days his mother wanted him to go up to the palace to show the king what a great man he had become <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the father said no he must not do that for if he does we shall have no more delight in him this time but he spoke in vain for the mother begged and prayed until at last he went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he arrived there he was more splendid both in raiment well you can see what kind of queen mine is but i cant see would to heaven she were standing here and then you would be able to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the young king and in an instant she was standing there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she was very sorrowful and said to him why didst thou not remember my words and listen only to what thy father said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now must i go home again at once and thou hast wasted both thy then she tied a ring in his hair which had her name upon it and wished herself at home again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now the young king was deeply afflicted and day out and day in went about thinking of naught else but how to get back again to his queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will try to see if there is any place where i can learn how to find whiteland he thought and journeyed forth out into the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had gone some distance he came to a mountain where he met a man who was lord over all the beasts in the forest for they all came to him when he blew a horn which he had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know that he answered but i will ask my beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he blew his horn and inquired whether any of them knew where whiteland lay but there was not one who knew that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the man gave him a pair of snow shoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you have these on he said you will come to my brother who lives hundreds of miles from here he is lord over all the birds in the airask him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you have got there just turn the shoes so that the toes point this way and then they will come home again of their own when the king arrived there he turned the shoes as the lord of the beasts had bidden him and they went back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he once more asked after whiteland and the man summoned all the birds together and inquired if any of them knew where whiteland lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long after the others there came an old eagle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been absent ten whole years but he too knew no more than the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well well said the man then you shall have the loan of a pair of snow shoes of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wear them you will get to my brother who lives hundreds of miles from here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is lord of all the fish in the seayou can ask him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but do not forget to turn the king thanked him put on the shoes and when he had got to him who was lord of all the fish in the sea he turned the snow shoes round and back they went just as the others had gone and he asked once more where whiteland was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man called the fish together with his horn but none of them knew anything about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last came an old old pike which he had great difficulty in bringing home to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he asked the pike it said yes whiteland is well known to me for i have been cook there these ten years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow morning i have to go back there for now the queen whose king is if that be the case i will give you a piece of advice said the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not far from here on a moor stand three brothers who have stood there a hundred years fighting for a hat a cloak and a pair of boots if any one has these three things he can make himself invisible and if he desires to go to any place he has but to wish and he is there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may tell them that you have a desire to try these things and then you will be able to decide which of the men is to so the king thanked him and went and did what he had said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is this that you are standing fighting about for ever and ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he to the brothers let me make a trial of these they willingly consented to this but when he had got the hat the cloak and the boots he said next time we meet you shall have my decision and hereupon he wished himself away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he was going quickly through the air he fell in with the north wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to whiteland said the king and then he related what had happened to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said the north wind you can easily go a little quicker than i can for i have to puff and blow into every corner but when you get there place yourself on the stairs by the side of the door and then i will come blustering in as if i wanted to blow down the whole castle and when the prince who is to have your queen comes out to see what is astir just take him by the throat and fling as the north wind had said so did the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood on the stairs and when the north wind came howling and roaring and caught the roof and walls of the castle till they shook again the prince went out to see what was the matter but as soon as he came the king took him by the neck and flung him out and then the north wind laid hold of him and carried him off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he was rid of him the king went into the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first the queen did not know him because he had grown so thin and pale from having travelled so long and so sorrowfully but when she saw her ring she was heartily glad and then the rightful wedding was held from j <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once upon a time there lived a man whose one wish and prayer was to get rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> day and night he thought of nothing else and at last his prayers were granted and he became very wealthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you never had the least least reason to think i would marry you and now according to your own words you think you have less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not sit tamely down and see you go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with a slight access of interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and his well bred bony face looked very determined albeit the eyes were wistful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly she felt sorry for him and she had never experienced a pang of sym pathy for a suitor before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot marry you dear weeliam she said and never had he seen her so sweet and adorable although he noted with a pang that her mouth was already drawn with a firmer line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for many years forty fifty perhapsi shall sit here on the veranda and you shall read to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she set her mouth until it was almost straight and picked up the little dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that perhaps she said quietly in a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sometimes think i should like to be a nun that after all it is my vocation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a cloistered one for that is but a selfish life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to teach to do good to forget myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are no convents in california but i could join the third order of the franciscans and wear the gray habit and be set aside by the world as one that only lived to make it a little better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that after all may be the secret of happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i envy none of my friends that are married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have the dear children it is true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the children grow up and go away and then one is fat and eats many dulces and the siesta grows longer and longer and the face very brown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should prefer to work and pray andwith a flash of insight that made her drop her work again and stare through the rosevinesto dream always of some beautiful thing that youth promised but never gave and that given might have ended in dull routine and a brain so choked with little things that memory too held nothing else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but concha cried sturgis eagerly i could give you far better than that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could take you away from hereto boston to europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should seelive your lifein the great cities you have dreamed ofthat you hardly believe inthat were made to enjoy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have told you of the theater the operayou should go to the finest in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should wear the most beautiful gowns and jewels go to courts see the great works of arti am not trying to bribe you he stammered flushing miserably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god forbid that i should stoop to any thing as mean as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it all rushed upon me suddenly that i could give you so much that you were made for with this worthless money of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what happiness to be in europe with you whatwhat his voice trembled and broke and he dared not look at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a splendid and thrilling panorama rose beyond them her bosom heaved her lips parted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw herself in it and not alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and not alas with the honest youth whose words had inspired it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment she shook her head and turned her eyes on the flushed averted face of her suitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall never see europe she said gently and i shall never marry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has no intention of asking a little california girl to share the honors of one of the most brilliant careers in europe she said calmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has paid me no more attention than is due my position as the daughter of the commandante and perhaps of la favorita <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i flirt a little and he flirts in response that is nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he will forget me in a month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the world his world is full of pretty girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a week ago you would not have said that said sturgis shrewdly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there has been nothing in your life to make you so humble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot explain but he seems to have brought the great world with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know i understand so many things that i had not dreamed of a week ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and sturgis who after all was a gallant gentle man made no comment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> governor arrillaga commandante arguello and chamberlain rezanov sat in the familiar sala at the presidio content in body after a culinary achievement worthy of padre landaeta but per turbed and alert of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the arrival of the two california dignitaries in the morning rezanov had sent davidov and langsdorff on shore to assure them of his gratitude and deep appreciation of the hospitality shown himself his officers and men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the governor had replied with a fulsome apology for not repairing at once to the juno to welcome his dis tinguished guest in person and pleading his age and the one hundred and seventyfive english miles he had ridden from monterey begged him as a younger man to waive informality and dine at the house of the commandante that very day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rezanov had complied as a matter of course and now he was alone with the men who held his fate in their hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dark worn rugged face of don jose who had been skilfully prepared by his oldest daughter to think well of the russian beamed with goodwill and interest in spite of lingering doubts but the lank wiry figure of the governor who was as digni fied as only a blond spaniard can be was fairly rigid with the severe formality he reserved for occa sions of ceremonybeing a gentleman who loved good company and cheerand his sharp gray eyes were almost shut in the effort to penetrate the de signs of this deputy this symbol this index in cipher of a dreaded race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rezanov smoked calmly made himself comfortable on the slippery horsehair chair though with no loss of dignity and beat about the bush with the others until the governor betrayed what you say of the neighborly instincts of the russian colonists for the spanish on this coast in terests me deeply excellency but if russia is at war with spain russia is not at war with spain said rezanov with a flash of amusement in his halfclosed eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> napoleon bonaparte is encamped about half way between the two countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not get at each other if they wished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while that man is at large europe will be at war with him no two na tions with each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a manner of reasoning that had not occurred to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything which is in the market goes to milverton and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one knows where his grip may fall for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have said that he is the worst man in london and i would ask you how could one compare the ruffian who in hot blood bludgeons his mate with this man who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen moneybags <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but surely said i the fellow must be within the grasp of the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would it profit a woman for example to get him a few months imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever he blackmailed an innocent person then indeed we should have him but he is as cunning as the evil one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no we must find other ways to fight him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the lady eva blackwell the most beautiful debutante of last season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is to be married in a fortnight to the earl of dovercourt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this fiend has several imprudent lettersimprudent watson nothing worsewhich were written to an impecunious young squire in the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would suffice to break off the match <end> <end> 
<start> <start> milverton will send the letters to the earl unless a large sum of money is paid him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been commissioned to meet him andto make the best terms i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking down i saw a stately carriage and pair the brilliant lamps gleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a footman opened the door and a small stout man in a shaggy astrakhan overcoat descended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a minute later he was in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charles augustus milverton was a man of fifty with a large intellectual head a round plump hairless face a perpetual frozen smile and two keen gray eyes which gleamed brightly from behind broad goldrimmed glasses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwicks benevolence in his appearance marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his voice was as smooth and suave as his countenance as he advanced with a plump little hand extended murmuring his regret for having missed us at his first visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> milvertons smile broadened he shrugged his shoulders removed his overcoat folded it with great deliberation over the back of a chair and then took a seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he with a wave in my direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is only in your clients interests that i protested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you say that you are acting for lady eva <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has she empowered you to accept my terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear sir it is painful for me to discuss it but if the money is not paid on the th there certainly will be no marriage on the th <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his insufferable smile was more complacent than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you appear to me he said at last to be taking matters too much for granted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am of course familiar with the contents of these letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my client will certainly do what i may advise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you evidently do not know the earl said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the baffled look upon holmess face i could see clearly that he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i can assure you that the earl of dovercourt would fail to appreciate them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however since you think otherwise we will let it rest at that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you think that it is in the best interests of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands of the earl then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we should certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sure that you would see it in that light he purred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time holmes continued lady eva is not a wealthy woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her resources and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg therefore that you will moderate your demands and that you will return the letters at the price i indicate which is i assure you the highest that you can get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> milvertons smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am aware that what you say is true about the ladys resources said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time you must admit that the occasion of a ladys marriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to make some little effort upon her behalf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butterdishes in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot help thinking that ladies are illadvised in not making an effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held up a little note with a coatofarms upon the envelope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that belongs towell perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until tomorrow morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at that time it will be in the hands of the ladys husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all because she will not find a beggarly sum which she could get by turning her diamonds into paste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the honourable miss miles and colonel dorking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only two days before the wedding there was a paragraph in the morning post to say that it was all off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is almost incredible but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here i find you a man of sense boggling about terms when your clients future and honour are at stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which i offer than to ruin this womans career which can profit you in no way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have eight or ten similar cases maturing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it was circulated among them that i had made a severe example of the lady eva i should find all of them much more open to reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now sir let us see the contents of that notebook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room and stood with his back against the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holmes he said turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver which projected from the inside pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been expecting you to do something original <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this has been done so often and what good has ever come from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you that i am armed to the teeth and i am perfectly prepared to use my weapons knowing that the law will support me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides your supposition that i would bring the letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now gentlemen i have one or two little interviews this evening and it is a long drive to hampstead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stepped forward took up his coat laid his hand on his revolver and turned to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i picked up a chair but holmes shook his head and i laid it down again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with bow a smile and a twinkle milverton was out of the room and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holmes sat motionless by the fire his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets his chin sunk upon his breast his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for half an hour he was silent and still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be back some time watson said he and vanished into the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understood that he had opened his campaign against charles augustus milverton but i little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some days holmes came and went at all hours in this attire but beyond a remark that his time was spent at hampstead and that it was not wasted i knew nothing of what he was doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last however on a wild tempestuous evening when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows he returned from his last expedition and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would not call me a marrying man watson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll be interested to hear that im engaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a plumber with a rising business escott by name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have walked out with her each evening and i have talked with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know milvertons house as i know the palm of my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must play your cards as best you can when such a stake is on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however i rejoice to say that i have a hated rival who will certainly cut me out the instant that my back is turned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he receives these wares not only from treacherous valets or maids but frequently from genteel ruffians who have gained the confidence and affection of trusting women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length and that the ruin of a noble family was the result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything which is in the market goes to milverton and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one knows where his grip may fall for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have said that he is the worst man in london and i would ask you how could one compare the ruffian who in hot blood bludgeons his mate with this man who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen moneybags <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but surely said i the fellow must be within the grasp of the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would it profit a woman for example to get him a few months imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever he blackmailed an innocent person then indeed we should have him but he is as cunning as the evil one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no we must find other ways to fight him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the lady eva brackwell the most beautiful debutante of last season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is to be married in a fortnight to the earl of dovercourt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this fiend has several imprudent letters imprudent watson nothing worse which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would suffice to break off the match <end> <end> 
<start> <start> milverton will send the letters to the earl unless a large sum of money is paid him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been commissioned to meet him and to make the best terms i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking down i saw a stately carriage and pair the brilliant lamps gleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a footman opened the door and a small stout man in a shaggy astrachan overcoat descended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a minute later he was in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charles augustus milverton was a man of fifty with a large intellectual head a round plump hairless face a perpetual frozen smile and two keen grey eyes which gleamed brightly from behind broad goldenrimmed glasses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pickwicks benevolence in his appearance marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his voice was as smooth and suave as his countenance as he advanced with a plump little hand extended murmuring his regret for having missed us at his first visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> milvertons smile broadened he shrugged his shoulders removed his overcoat folded it with great deliberation over the back of a chair and then took a seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he with a wave in my direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is only in your clients interests that i protested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you say that you are acting for lady eva <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has she empowered you to accept my terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear sir it is painful for me to discuss it but if the money is not paid on the th there certainly will be no marriage on the th <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his insufferable smile was more complacent than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you appear to me he said at last to be taking matters too much for granted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am of course familiar with the contents of these letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my client will certainly do what i may advise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you evidently do not know the earl said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the baffled look upon holmess face i could see clearly that he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i can assure you that the earl of dovercourt would fail to appreciate them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however since you think otherwise we will let it rest at that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you think that it is in the best interests of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands of the earl then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we would certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sure that you would see it in that light he purred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time holmes continued lady eva is not a wealthy woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her resources and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg therefore that you will moderate your demands and that you will return the letters at the price i indicate which is i assure you the highest that you can get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> milvertons smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am aware that what you say is true about the ladys resources said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time you must admit that the occasion of a ladys marriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to make some little effort upon her behalf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butterdishes in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot help thinking that ladies are illadvised in not making an effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held up a little note with a coatofarms upon the envelope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that belongs to well perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until tomorrow morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at that time it will be in the hands of the ladys husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all because she will not find a beggarly sum which she could get by turning her diamonds into paste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the honourable miss miles and colonel dorking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only two days before the wedding there was a paragraph in the morning post to say that it was all off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is almost incredible but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here i find you a man of sense boggling about terms when your clients future and honour are at stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which i offer than to ruin this womans career which can profit you in no way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have eight or ten similar cases maturing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it was circulated among them that i had made a severe example of the lady eva i should find all of them much more open to reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now sir let us see the contents of that notebook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room and stood with his back against the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> holmes he said turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver which projected from the inside pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been expecting you to do something original <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this has been done so often and what good has ever come from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you that i am armed to the teeth and i am perfectly prepared to use my weapons knowing that the law will support me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides your supposition that i would bring the letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now gentlemen i have one or two little interviews this evening and it is a long drive to hampstead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stepped forward took up his coat laid his hand on his revolver and turned to the door <end> <end>

<start> <start> i understood that he had opened his campaign against charles augustus milverton but i little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some days holmes came and went at all hours in this attire but beyond a remark that his time was spent at hampstead and that it was not wasted i knew nothing of what he was doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last however on a wild tempestuous evening when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows he returned from his last expedition and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would not call me a marrying man watson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll be interested to hear that i am engaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a plumber with a rising business escott by name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have walked out with her each evening and i have talked with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know milvertons house as i know the palm of my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must play your cards as best you can when such a stake is on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i never saw a real baseball crowd before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a soul in that crowd ever heard of you but i believe tomorrow the whole baseball world will have heard of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then she lifted her face and pulling him down within reach she kissed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan took her husbands work in dead earnest she gloried in it and perhaps she had as much to do with making him a great pitcher as any of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rube left the box and i found a seat between nan and milly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those bleachers made me glow with managerial satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the field both teams pranced and danced and bounced around in practice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of the absolutely last degree of egotism manifested by the philadelphia players i could not but admire such a splendid body of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so these are the champions of last season and of this season too commented milly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they appear not to exert themselves yet they always get the ball in perfect time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it all reminds me ofof the rhythm of music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that champion batter and runnerthat lane in center isnt he just beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walks and runs like a blueribbon winner at the horse show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you one thing connie these quakers are on dress oh these quakers hate themselves i dont think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being a rabid girlfan it was of course impossible for nan to speak baseball convictions or gossip without characteristic baseball slang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw the like in my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that fellow lane is so swelled that he cant get down off his toes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but hes a wonder i must admit that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> easy fast trainedtheyre machines and ill bet theyre indians to fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can see it sticking out all over them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this will certainly be some game with whit handing up that jump ball of his to this gang of champs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gong rang the crowd seemed to hum and rustle softly to quiet attention umpire mcclung called the names of the batteries then the there was the usual applause from the grand stand and welcome cheers from the bleachers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rube was the last player to go out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morrisey was a manager who always played to the stands and no doubt he held the rube back for effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if so he ought to have been gratified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that moment reminded me of my own team and audience upon the occasion of the rubes debut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the same only here it happened in the big league before a championship team and twenty thousand fans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the roar that went up from the bleachers might well have scared an unseasoned pitcher out of his wits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the quakers lined up before their bench and gazed at this newcomer who had the nerve to walk out there to the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cogswell stood on the coaching line looked at the rube and then held up both arms and turned toward the chicago bench as if to ask morrisey where nan quick as a flash to catch a point leaned over the boxrail and looked at the champions with fire in her eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certain it was that there was no one who knew the rube as well as i and i knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that the hour before me would see brightening of a great star pitcher on the big league horizon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was bound to be a full hour for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had much reason to be grateful to whit hurtle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had pulled my team out of a rut and won me the pennant and the five thousand dollars i got for his release bought the little cottage on the hill for milly and me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was my pride in having developed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all that i needed to calm me settle me down into assurance and keen criticism of the game was to see the rube pitch a few balls with his old incomparable speed and control <end> <end> 
<start> <start> berne first batter for the quakers walked up to the plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was another billy hamilton built like a wedge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw him laugh at the long pitcher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ducked escaping the ball by a smaller margin than appeared good for his confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke low to the rube and what he said was probably not flavored with the milk of friendly sweetness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called out the rube swung his enormously long arm took an enormous stride toward third base and pitched again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rubes next one was his out curve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it broke toward the corner of the plate and would have been a strike had not berne popped it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> callopy the second hitter faced the rube and he too after the manner of ball players made some remark meant only for the rubes ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drove more pitchers mad with his implacable patience than any hitter in the league <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first one of the rubes he waited on crossed the incorner the second crossed the outcorner and the third was rubes wide slow tantalizing stitchball as we call it for the reason that it came so slow a batter could count the stitches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe callopy waited on that curve decided to hit it changed his mind and waited some more and finally the ball maddened him and he had to poke at it the result being a weak grounder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said roderick meditatively she is making a fool of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what do you expect to come of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and roderick put his hands into his pockets and looked as if he had announced the most colorless fact in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the light of your late interview what do you make of your young lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could tell you that it would be plain sailing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she ll not tell me again i am weak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you very sure you are not weak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may be but she shall never know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rowland said no more until they reached the corso when he asked his companion whether he was going to his studio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roderick started out of a reverie and passed his hands over his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no i cant settle down to work after such a scene as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not afraid of breaking my neck then but i feel all in a tremor now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will goi will go and sit in the sun on the pincio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> promise me this first said rowland very solemnly that the next time you meet miss light it shall be on the earth and not in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since his return from frascati roderick had been working doggedly at the statue ordered by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to rowlands eye he had made a very fair beginning but he had himself insisted from the first that he liked neither his subject nor his patron and that it was impossible to feel any warmth of interest in a work which was to be incorporated into the ponderous personality of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all against the grain he wrought without love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless after a fashion he wrought and the figure grew beneath his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss blanchards friend was ordering works of art on every side and his purveyors were in many cases persons whom roderick declared it was infamy to be paired with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had been grand tailors he said who declined to make you a coat unless you got the hat you were to wear with it from an artist of their own choosing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him that he had an equal right to exact that his statue should not form part of the same system of ornament as the pearl of perugia a picture by an american confrere who had in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leavenworth used to drop into rodericks studio to see how things were getting on and give a friendly hint or so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would seat himself squarely plant his goldtopped cane between his legs which he held very much apart rest his large white hands on the head and enunciate the principles of spiritual art as he hoisted them one by one as you might say out of the depths of his moral consciousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his benignant and imperturbable pomposity gave roderick the sense of suffocating beneath a large fluffy bolster and the worst of the matter was that the good gentlemans placid vanity had an integument whose toughness no sarcastic shaft could pierce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roderick admitted that in thinking over the tribulations of struggling genius the danger of dying of overpatronage had never occurred to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deterring effect of the episode of the coliseum was apparently of long continuance if rodericks nerves had been shaken his hand needed time to recover its steadiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cultivated composure upon principles of his own by frequenting entertainments from which he returned at four oclock in the morning and lapsing into habits which might fairly be called irregular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had hitherto made few friends among the artistic fraternity chiefly because he had taken no trouble about it and there was in his demeanor an elastic independence of the favor of his fellowmortals which made social advances on his own part peculiarly necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rowland had told him more than once that he ought to fraternize a trifle more with the other artists and he had always answered that he had not the smallest objection to fraternizing let them come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they came on rare occasions and roderick was not punctilious about returning their visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he declared there was not one of them whose works gave him the smallest desire to make acquaintance with the insides of their heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gloriani he professed a superb contempt and having been once to look at his wares never crossed his threshold again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only one of the fraternity for whom by his own admission he cared a straw was little singleton but he expressed his regard only in a kind of sublime hilarity whenever he encountered this humble genius and quite forgot his existence in the intervals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had never been to see him but singleton edged his way from time to time timidly into rodericks studio and agreed with characteristic modesty that brilliant fellows like the sculptor might consent to receive homage but could hardly be expected to render it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roderick never exactly accepted homage and apparently did not quite observe whether poor singleton spoke in admiration or in blame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rodericks taste as to companions was singularly capricious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were very good fellows who were disposed to cultivate him who bored him to death and there were others in whom even rowlands goodnature was unable to discover a pretext for tolerance in whom he appeared to find the highest social qualities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he used to give the most fantastic reasons for his likes and dislikes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would declare he could nt speak a civil word to a man who brushed his hair in a certain fashion and he would explain his unaccountable fancy for an individual of imperceptible merit by telling you that he had an ancestor who in the thirteenth century had walled up his wife alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like to talk to a man whose ancestor has walled up his wife alive he would say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may not see the fun of it and think poor p is a very dull fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it s very possible i dont ask you to admire him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for reasons of my own i like to have him about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old fellow left her for three days with her face uncovered and placed a long mirror opposite to her so that she could see as he said if her gown was a fit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his relish for an odd flavor in his friends had led him to make the acquaintance of a number of people outside of rowlands wellordered circle and he made no secret of their being very queer fish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he formed an intimacy among others with a crazy fellow who had come to rome as an emissary of one of the central american republics to drive some ecclesiastical bargain with the papal government <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pope had given him the cold shoulder but since he had not prospered as a diplomatist he had sought compensation as a man of the world and his great flamboyant curricle and negro lackeys were for several weeks one of the striking ornaments of the pincian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke a queer jargon of italian spanish french and english humorously relieved with scraps of ecclesiastical latin and to those who inquired of roderick what he found to interest him in such a fantastic jackanapes the latter would reply looking at his interlocutor with his lucid blue eyes that it was worth any sacrifice to hear him talk nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two had gone together one night to a ball given by a lady of some renown in the spanish colony and very late on his way home roderick came up to rowlands rooms in whose windows he had seen a light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rowland was going to bed but roderick flung himself into an armchair and chattered for an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the friends of the costa rican envoy were as amusing as himself and in very much the same line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mistress of the house had worn a yellow satin dress and gold heels to her slippers and at the close of the entertainment had sent for a pair of castanets tucked up her petticoats and danced a fandango while the gentlemen sat crosslegged on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was awfully low roderick said all of a sudden i perceived it and bolted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing of that kind ever amuses me to the end before it s half over it bores me to death it makes me sick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hang it why cant a poor fellow enjoy things in peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my illusions are all brokenwinded they wont carry me twenty paces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant laugh and forget my laugh dies away before it begins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your friend stendhal writes on his bookcovers i never got farther that he has seen too early in life la beaute parfaite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how early he saw it i saw it before i was born in another state of being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant describe it positively i can only say i dont find it anywhere now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not at the bottom of champagne glasses not strange as it may seem in that extra halfyard or so of shoulder that some women have their balldresses cut to expose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont find it at merry suppertables where half a dozen ugly men with pomatumed heads are rapidly growing uglier still with heat and wine not when i come away and walk through these squalid black streets and go out into the forum and see a few old battered stone posts standing there like gnawed bones stuck into the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything is mean and dusky and shabby and the men and women who make up this socalled brilliant society are the meanest and shabbiest of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have no real spontaneity they are all cowards and popinjays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have no more dignity than so many grasshoppers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he jumped up and stood looking at one of his statues which shone vaguely across the room in the dim lamplight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes do tell us said rowland what to hold on by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those things of mine were tolerably good he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my idea was betterand that s what i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was willing to wait for roderick to complete the circle of his metamorphoses but he had no desire to officiate as chorus to the play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if roderick chose to fish in troubled waters he must land his prizes himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think i m an impudent humbug the latter said at last coming up to moralize at this hour of the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think i want to throw dust into your eyes to put you off the scent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that s your eminently rational view of the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me from taking any view at all said rowland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have ceased then positively to believe in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you have hit your mark and made people care for you you should nt twist your weapon about at that rate in their vitals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some days afterward it happened that rowland on a long afternoon ramble took his way through one of the quiet corners of the trastevere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was particularly fond of this part of rome though he could hardly have expressed the charm he found in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as you pass away from the dusky swarming purlieus of the ghetto you emerge into a region of empty soundless grassgrown lanes and alleys where the shabby houses seem mouldering away in disuse and yet your footstep brings figures of startling roman type to the doorways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are few monuments here but no part of rome seemed more historic in the sense of being weighted with a crushing past blighted with the melancholy of things that had had their day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the yellow afternoon sunshine slept on the sallow battered walls and lengthened the shadows in the grassy courtyards of small closed churches the place acquired a strange fascination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the church of saint cecilia has one of these sunny wastelooking courts the edifice seems abandoned to silence and the charity of chance devotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rowland never passed it without going in and he was generally the only visitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he entered it now but found that two persons had preceded him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one was at her prayers at one of the side altars the other was seated against a column at the upper end of the nave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rowland walked to the altar and paid in a momentary glance at the clever statue of the saint in death in the niche beneath it the usual tribute to the charm of polished ingenuity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he turned away he looked at the person seated and recognized christina light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing that she perceived him he advanced to speak to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was sitting in a listless attitude with her hands in her lap she seemed to be tired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was dressed simply as if for walking and escaping observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had greeted her he glanced back at her companion and recognized the faithful assunta <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is not here i am happy to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a strange place to find you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people call me a strange girl and i might as well have the comfort of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came to take a walk that by the way is part of my strangeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant loll all the morning on a sofa and all the afternoon in a carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must move i must do something and see something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile i put on an old dress and half a dozen veils i take assunta under my arm and we start on a pedestrian tour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it s a bore that i cant take the poodle but he attracts attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we trudge about everywhere there is nothing i like so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you will congratulate me on the simplicity of my tastes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to live in rome and not to walk would i think be poor pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you are terribly far from home and i am afraid you are tired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> might i offer you my company while you rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rowland said he would do what he could and brought a chair and placed it near her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not in love with her he disapproved of her he mistrusted her and yet he felt it a kind of privilege to watch her and he found a peculiar excitement in talking to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the background of her nature as he would have called it was large and mysterious and it emitted strange fantastic gleams and flashes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover it was not a disadvantage to talk to a girl who made one keep guard on ones composure it diminished ones chronic liability to utter something less than revised wisdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> assunta had risen from her prayers and as he took his place was coming back to her mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no while you are about it say a few dozen more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has been at it half an hour i envy her capacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you never felt in any degree rowland asked the fascination of catholicism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a tall graybearded muscular old man with a skirt of feathers about him and necklaces of bones and animals claws around his bare chest ran in front of them and seemed to be trying to make them approach more slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said stedman he is trying to keep them back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe he ever saw a white man before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stedman said albert speaking quickly give your gun to bradley and go forward with your arms in the air and waving your handkerchief and tell them in their language that the king is coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they go at you bradley and i will kill a goat or two to show them what we can do with the rifles and if that dont stop them we will shoot at their legs and if that dont stop themi guess youd better come back and well all run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stedman looked at albert and albert looked at stedman and neither of them winced or flinched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the consul but a resignation is always in order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you neednt go if you dont like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see you know the language and i dont but i know how to shoot and you dont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats perfectly satisfactory said stedman handing his gun to old bradley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only wanted to know why i was to be sacrificed instead of one of the bradleys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see the evil results of a higher education <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wish me luck please he said and for goodness sake he added impressively dont waste much time shooting goats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farther away i have a glimpse of graceful planes children of moonlight and mist their dainty robes still more or less unsullied gleam ghostly in the gaslight athwart the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they make a brave show even in winter with their feathery branches and swinging tassels whereas my little tree stands stark and uncompromising with its horde of sooty sparrows cockney to the last tail feather and a pathetic inability to look anything but black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rain comes with strong caressing fingers and the branches seem no whit the cleaner for her care but then their glistening blackness mirrors back the succeeding sunlight as a muddy pavement will sometimes lap our feet in a sea of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little wet sparrows are for the moment equally transformed for the sun turns their duncoloured coats to a ruddy bronze and cries chrysostom as it kisses each shiny beak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are dumb chrysostoms but they preach a golden gospel for the sparrows are to london what the rainbow was to eight saved souls out of a waste of waters a perpetual sign of the remembering mercies of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last night there was a sudden clatter of hoofs a shout and then silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a runaway cabhorse a dark night a wide crossing and a heavy burden so death came to a poor woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people from the house went out to help and i heard of her the centre of an unknowing curious crowd as she lay bonnetless in the mud of the road her head on the kerb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a rude but painless death the misery lay in her life for this woman worn whitehaired and wrinkled had but fifty years to set against such a condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the policeman reported her respectable hardworking living apart from her husband with a sister but although they shared rooms they did not speak and the sister refused all responsibility so the parish buried the dead woman and thus ended an uneventful tragedy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lonely souls that hold out timid hands to an unheeding world have their meed of interior comfort even here while the sons of consolation wait on the threshhold for their footfall but god help the soul that bars its own door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is kicking against the pricks of divine ordinance the ordinance of a triune god whether it be the dweller in crowded street or tenement who is proud to say i keep myself to myself or seneca writing in pitiful complacency whenever i have gone among men i have returned home less of a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever the next world holds in store we are bidden in this to seek and serve god in our fellowmen and in the creatures of his making whom he calls by name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was once my privilege to know an old organgrinder named gawdine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a hard swearer a hard drinker a hard liver and he fortified himself body and soul against the world he even drank alone which is an evil sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never seemed to me to be a hard man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phil gazed at the poorly dressed woman with a surprise which he did not attempt to conceal for in her he recognized the familiar figure of his landlady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what could she have to do in this house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forbush in a surprise as great as his own for she had never asked where her young lodger worked and was not aware that he was in the employ of her cousins husband and well acquainted with the rich uncle whom she had not seen for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pitkin whose turn it was to be surprised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this young gentleman lodges in my house answered mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had his share of human nature and it would have given him satisfaction to thrash the insolent young patrician as alonzo chose to consider himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what do you want here young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pitkin in a frosty tone addressing phil of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carter seems to be very much in request <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt he will be very much disappointed when he hears what he has lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will have to go to florida to see him i think however <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she added after a pause it will not be well for either of you to call again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carter will understand the motive of your calls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not forgotten that we are cousins surely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not care to remember it mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forbush to say goodday also and to descend the steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were much together as girls and were both educated at the same expensive schools <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forbush whose fault was that he was poor and chiefly i think through the efforts of lavinia pitkin i was cast out by the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philip explained the circumstances already known to the reader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carter seems to me to be a kindhearted man he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe he would have cast you off if he had not been influenced by other parties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell you she continued after a pause what drew me here this afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am struggling hard to keep my head above water mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brent but i find it hard to meet my expenses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot meet my rent due tomorrow within fifteen dollars and i dared to hope that if i could meet uncle oliver face to face and explain matters to him he would let me have the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure he would said phil warmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he is in florida and will probably remain there for a month or two at least said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but even if he were in the city i suppose lavinia would do all in her power to keep us apart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though she is your cousin i dislike her very much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose the boy with whom you were talking was her son alonzo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he is about the most disagreeable boy i ever met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both he and his mother seem very much opposed to my having an interview with your uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lavinia was always of a jealous and suspicious disposition said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not seen alonzo since he was a baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is two years older than my julia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was born before i estranged my relatives by marrying a poor man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall try to get the landlord to wait but i dont know how he will feel about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would gladly lend you all you need <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure you would philip said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the offer does me good though it is not accompanied by the ability to do what your good heart dictates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel that i am not without friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a very poor one said phil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact is i am in trouble myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my income is only five dollars a week and my expenses are beyond that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how i am going to keep up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may stay with me for three dollars a week if you cannot pay four said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forbush forgetting her own troubles in her sympathy with our hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you need money as much as i do and perhaps more for you have more than yourself to support <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is born to a heritage of poverty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heaven only knows how we are going to get along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how it is but in spite of my troubles i feel cheerful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a confidence that things will come out well though i cannot possibly imagine how <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are young and youth is more inclined to be hopeful than maturer years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however i do not wish to dampen your cheerfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if phil could have heard the conversation that took place between mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pitkin and alonzo after their departure he might have felt less hopeful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is dreadfully annoying that that woman should turn up after all these years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but she disgraced herself by a low marriage and was cast off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she could meet uncle oliver i am afraid she would worm herself into his confidence and get him to do something for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it is unfortunate that she and that boy have fallen in with each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she may get him to speak to uncle oliver in her behalf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allen ran in front of the piano holding out an imaginary dress in imitation of polly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> parenthesis jumped in front of the pianostool trying vainly to hide it with his legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell on his knees before the stool spreading out his waistcoat for a screen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yelled sagebrush as the door opened and the astonished echo faced those she loved and liked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> echo made a pretty picture framed in the doorway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore her ridinghabit of olivegreenfrom the hem of which peeped her soft boots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her hat broad picturesque typical of the southwest had slipped backward forming a background for her pretty face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an amused smile played about the corners of her mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre herded up like a bunch of cows in a norther <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got only as far as this yere bein a birthday when echo interrupted him oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once stopped sagebrush could not get started again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cleared his throat with more emphasis than politeness striking the attitude of an orator with one hand upraised and the other on his hip he hemmed and hawed until beads of perspiration trickled down his temples <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he opened and dosed his mouth froglike several times taking long gulping breaths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last looking helplessly about him he shouted oh shucks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack rested his hand on the table and began weve a surprise for youthat is the boys have what is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got to call it blind broke in sagebrush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said show low at the idea of presenting echo with anything on wheels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sagebrush encouraged her thats something like itgo ongo on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then its a sagebrush grew more excited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raised and lowered himself on his toes backing toward the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a again she hesitated to be helped on by sagebrush with the assurance shell do itfire awayits a a go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sagebrush in his enthusiasm backed too far into the blanket screen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to save himself from a fall he threw out his hand behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they struck the polished cover of the instrument slid off and sagebrush sat down on the keys with an unmistakable crash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> parenthesis from his place on the floor looked at the mischiefmaker in disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> going up to sagebrush he shook his fist in his face saying youre the limit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the victim of the accident humbly replied i couldnt help it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allen smoothed out the differences by declaring whats the difference she wouldnt have guessed not in a million fresno swept them all aside with the blanket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whowhatwhere she stammered glancing from one to the other her eyes finally resting on jack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have to thank the boys for this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with happy tears welling up in her eyes echo said i do thank them i doi doi cant tell how delighted i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant say how much this means to mei thank youi say it once but i feel it a thousand times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seized each of the boys by the hand and shook it heartily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked fresno relieving the tension of the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fresno looked very much crestfallen since he considered that he had made a deep impression by his first effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paysons goin to hit us out a tune announced sagebrush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack leaned against the instrument gazing fondly into her eyes as she raised her face radiant with happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allen had taken possession of the best rockingchair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allen sat at the table and the boys ranged themselves about the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> echo played the opening bars of the old folks at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before she sang fresno holding up his right indexfinger remarked to no one in particular i washed that finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she threw her whole soul into the old ballad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was so happy she felt like singing not lively airs but songs about home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her new home had become so dear to her at that moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were tears even in the of some of the punchers although they blinked vigorously to keep them back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one hand he held a turban of white muslin striped with red in the other a small chamois leather bag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodevening said douglas stone when the butler had closed the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am from asia minor but i speak english when i speak slow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wanted me to go out i understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted very much that you should see my wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could come in the morning but i have an engagement which prevents me from seeing your wife tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pulled the string which closed the mouth of the chamois leather bag and poured a flood of gold on to the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are one hundred pounds there said he and i promise you that it will not take you an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a cab ready at the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an hour would not make it too late to visit lady sannox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the fee was an extraordinarily high one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been pressed by his creditors lately and he could not afford to let such a chance pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not perhaps heard of the daggers of the almohades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah they are eastern daggers of a great age and of a singular shape with the hilt like what you call a stirrup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a curiosity dealer you understand and that is why i have come to england from smyrna but next week i go back once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many things i brought with me and i have a few things left but among them to my sorrow is one of these daggers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will remember that i have an appointment sir said the surgeon with some irritation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> today my wife fell down in a faint in the room in which i keep my wares and she cut her lower lip upon this cursed dagger of almohades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you wish me to dress the wound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes and there is no man east or west who can tell now what is the poison or what the cure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but all that is known i know for my father was in this trade before me and we have had much to do with these poisoned weapons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why then should you pay me this considerable fee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no drug can cure but the knife may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it be on the finger take the finger off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but think of where this wound is and that it is my wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but familiarity with such grim matters may take the finer edge from a mans sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to douglas stone this was already an interesting case and he brushed aside as irrelevant the feeble objections of the husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appears to be that or nothing said he brusquely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is better to lose a lip than a life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah yes i know that you are right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well well it is kismet and must be faced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have the cab and you will come with me and do this thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> douglas stone took his case of bistouries from a drawer and placed it with a roll of bandage and a compress of lint in his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must waste no more time if he were to see lady sannox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am ready said he pulling on his overcoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you take a glass of wine before you go out into this cold air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his visitor shrank away with a protesting hand upraised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you forget that i am a mussulman and a true follower of the prophet said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tell me what is the bottle of green glass which you have placed in your pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a spirit and we make no use of such things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would allow your wife to go through an operation without an anaesthetic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deep sleep has already come on which is the first working of the poison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i have given her of our smyrna opium <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come sir for already an hour has passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they stepped out into the darkness a sheet of rain was driven in upon their faces and the hall lamp which dangled from the arm of a marble caryatid went out with a fluff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pim the butler pushed the heavy door to straining hard with his shoulder against the wind while the two men groped their way towards the yellow glare which showed where the cab was waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an instant later they were rattling upon their journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have a very little quiet place off the euston road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon pressed the spring of his repeater and listened to the little tings which told him the hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he calculated the distances and the short time which it would take him to perform so trivial an operation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ought to reach lady sannox by ten oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the fogged windows he saw the blurred gaslamps dancing past with occasionally the broader glare of a shop front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rain was pelting and rattling upon the leathern top of the carriage and the wheels swashed as they rolled through puddle and mud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> opposite to him the white headgear of his companion gleamed faintly through the obscurity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon felt in his pockets and arranged his needles his ligatures and his safetypins that no time might be wasted when they arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he chafed with impatience and drummed his foot upon the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the cab slowed down at last and pulled up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a kingdom be as imlac tells us a great family a family likewise is a little kingdom torn with factions and exposed to revolutions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an unpractised observer expects the love of parents and children to be constant and equal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this kindness seldom continues beyond the years of infancy in a short time the children become rivals to their parents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> benefits are allowed by parents and children seldom act in concert each child endeavours to appropriate the esteem or the fondness of the parents and the parents with yet less temptation betray each other to their children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus some place their confidence in the father and some in the mother and by degrees the house is filled with artifices the opinions of children and parents of the young and the old are naturally opposite by the contrary effects of hope and despondency of expectation and experience without crime or folly on either side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the colours of life in youth and age appear different as the face of nature in spring and winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how can children credit the assertions of parents which their own eyes show few parents act in such a manner as much to enforce their maxims by the credit of their lives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man trusts wholly to slow contrivance and gradual progression the youth expects to force his way by genius vigour and precipitance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man pays regard to riches and the youth reverences virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man deifies prudence the youth commits himself to magnanimity and chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man who intends no ill believes that none is intended and therefore acts with openness and candour but his father having suffered the injuries of fraud is impelled to suspect and too often allured to practise it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> age looks with anger on the temerity of youth and youth with contempt on the scrupulosity of age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus parents and children for the greatest part live on to love less and less and if those whom nature has thus closely united are the torments of each other where shall we look for tenderness and consolations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely said the prince you must have been unfortunate in your choice of acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am unwilling to believe that the most tender of all relations is thus impeded in its effects by natural necessity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> domestic discord answered she is not inevitably and fatally necessary but yet it is not easily avoided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we seldom see that a whole family is virtuous the good and the evil cannot well agree and the evil can yet less agree with one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the virtuous fall sometimes to variance when their virtues are of different kinds and tending to extremes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in general those parents have most reverence who most deserve it for he that lives well many other evils infest private life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some are the slaves of servants whom they have trusted with their affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some are kept in continual anxiety by the caprice of rich relations whom they cannot please and dare not offend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some husbands are imperious and some wives perverse and as it is always more easy to do evil than good though the wisdom or virtue of one can very rarely make many happy the folly or vice of one makes many miserable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if such be the general effect of marriage said the prince i shall for the future think it dangerous to connect my interest with that of another lest i should be unhappy by my partners fault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have met said the princess with many who live single for that reason but i never found that their prudence ought to raise envy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dream away their time without friendship without fondness and are driven to rid themselves of the day for which they have no use by childish amusements or vicious delights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and fell down in turn the cock of the urn upon her royal highness said the king and the boiling water gradually revived her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his majesty looked at his watch compared it by the clock in the parlour and by that of the church in the square opposite then he wound it up then he looked at it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great question is says he am i fast or am i slow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if im slow we may as well go on with breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if im fast why there is just the possibility of saving prince bulbo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a doosid awkward mistake and upon my word hedzoff i have the greatest mind to have you hanged sire i did but my duty a soldier has but his orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt expect after fortyseven years of faithful service that my a hundred thousand plagues upon you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you see that while you are talking my bulbo is being hung <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes always right that girl and im so absent says the king looking at his watch again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> write the reprieve and let me run with it cries the princessand she got a sheet of paper and pen confound it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go up into my bedroom look under my pillow not your mammas there youll see my keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> angelica was gone and had run up panting to the bedroom and found the keys and was back again before the king had finished a muffin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now love says he you must go all the way back for my desk in which my spectacles are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you would but have heard me out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his majesty called in his loud voice she knew my dear when you go out of a room how often have i told you shut the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the keys and the desk and the spectacles were got and the king mended his pen and signed his name to a reprieve and angelica ran with it as swift as the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd better stay my love and finish the muffins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hand me over that raspberry jam please said the monarch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew it angelica ran and ran and ran and ran <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ran up fore street and down high street and through the marketplace and down to the left and over the bridge and up the blind alley and back again and round by the castle and so along by the haberdashers on the right opposite the lamppost and round the square and she cameshe came to the execution place where she saw bulbo laying his head on the block <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the executioner raised his axe but at that moment the princess came panting up and cried reprieve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up the scaffold stairs she sprang with the agility of a lighter of lamps and flinging herself in bulbos arms regardless of all ceremony she cried out oh my prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face glowed at such moments with such inward joy that one could see how near and dear the words he was reading were to his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew the whole gospel almost by heart but he said that every time he read it he enjoyed a new and genuine spiritual delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that not only was everything intelligible to him in the gospel but that when he read it he seemed to be reading in his own soul and felt himself capable of rising higher and higher toward god and merging himself in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not mean to recount all the misunderstandings which existed between my father and turgenieff which ended in a complete breach between them in the actual external facts of that story are common property and there is no need to repeat them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to general opinion the quarrel between the two greatest writers of the day arose out of their literary rivalry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fet at whose house the quarrel took place tells all about it in his memoirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tolstoy dogmatized about ladylike charity apropos of turgenieffs daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turgenieff in a fit of nerves threatened to box his ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tolstoy challenged him to a duel and turgenieff apologized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is my intention to show cause against this generally received opinion and before i come to turgenieffs visits to yasnaya polyana i want to make as clear as i can the real reason of the perpetual discords between these two goodhearted people who had a cordial affection for each other discords which led in the end to an outandout quarrel and the exchange of mutual defiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as far as i know my father never had any serious difference with any other human being during the whole course of his existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and turgenieff in a letter to my father in wrote you are the only man with whom i have ever had misunderstandings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever my father related his quarrel with ivan sergeyevitch he took all the blame on himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turgenieff immediately after the quarrel wrote a letter apologizing to my father and never sought to justify his own part in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why was it that as turgenieff himself put it his constellation and my fathers moved in the ether with unquestioned enmity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is what my sister tatyana wrote on the subject in her article turgenieff published in the supplement to all question of literary rivalry it seems to me is utterly beside the mark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do i stand a chance of losing master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fig for em all i have none they are nothing to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me a good scuffle let me pay off old scores in a bold riot where there are men to stand by me and then use me what have you done with that paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drop it again as you go along its as well not to keep such hugh nodded and touching his cap with an air of as much respect as he could summon up departed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir john fastening the doors behind him went back to his dressingroom and sat down once again before the fire at which he gazed for a long time in earnest meditation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this happens fortunately he said breaking into a smile and promises well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my relative and i who are the most protestant fellows in the world give our worst wishes to the roman catholic cause and to saville who introduces their bill i have a personal objection besides but as each of us has himself for the first article in his creed we cannot commit ourselves by joining with a very extravagant madman such as this gordon most undoubtedly is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now really to foment his disturbances in secret through the medium of such a very apt instrument as my savage friend here may further our real ends and to express at all becoming seasons in moderate and polite terms a disapprobation of his proceedings though we agree with him in principle will certainly be to gain a character for honesty and uprightness of purpose which cannot fail to do us infinite service and to raise us into some importance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to private considerations i confess that if these vagabonds would make some riotous demonstration which does not appear impossible and would inflict some little chastisement on haredale as a not inactive man among his sect it would be extremely agreeable to my feelings and would amuse me beyond measure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps when he came to this point he took a pinch of snuff then beginning slowly to undress he resumed his meditations by saying i fear i do fear exceedingly that my friend is following fast in the footsteps of his mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his intimacy with mr dennis is very ominous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have no doubt he must have come to that end any way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i lend him a helping hand the only difference is that he may upon the whole possibly drink a few gallons or puncheons or hogsheads less in this life than he otherwise would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its no so he took another pinch of snuff and went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the workshop of the golden key there issued forth a tinkling sound so merry and goodhumoured that it suggested the idea of some one working blithely and made quite pleasant music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no man who hammered on at a dull monotonous duty could have brought such cheerful notes from steel and iron none but a chirping healthy honesthearted fellow who made the best of everything and felt kindly towards everybody could have done it for an instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might have been a coppersmith and still been musical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had sat in a jolting waggon full of rods of iron it seemed as if he would have brought some harmony out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tink tink tinkclear as a silver bell and audible at every pause of the streets harsher noises as though it said i dont care nothing puts me out i am resolved to he happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> women scolded children squalled heavy carts went rumbling by horrible cries proceeded from the lungs of hawkers still it struck in again no higher no lower no louder no softer not thrusting itself on peoples notice a bit the more for having been outdone by louder soundstink tink tink tink tink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a perfect embodiment of the still small voice free from all cold hoarseness huskiness or unhealthiness of any kind foot passengers slackened their pace and were disposed to linger near it neighbours who had got up splenetic that morning felt good humour stealing on them as they heard it and by degrees became quite sprightly mothers danced their babies to its ringing still the same magical tink tink tink came gaily from the workshop of the golden key <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who but the locksmith could have made such music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gleam of sun shining through the unsashed window and chequering the dark workshop with a broad patch of light fell full upon him as though attracted by his sunny heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he stood working at his anvil his face all radiant with exercise and gladness his sleeves turned up his wig pushed off his shining foreheadthe easiest freest happiest man in all the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside him sat a sleek cat purring and winking in the light and falling every now and then into an idle doze as from excess of comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toby looked on from a tall bench hard by one beaming smile from his broad nutbrown face down to the slackbaked buckles in his shoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very locks that hung around had something jovial in their rust and seemed like gouty gentlemen of hearty natures disposed to joke on their infirmities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing surly or severe in the whole scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed impossible that any one of the innumerable keys could fit a churlish strongbox or a prisondoor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cellars of beer and wine rooms where there were fires books gossip and cheering laughter these were their proper sphere of action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> places of distrust and cruelty and restraint they would have left quadruplelocked for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the locksmith paused at last and wiped his brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the silence roused the cat who jumping softly down crept to the door and watched with tiger eyes a birdcage in an opposite window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabriel lifted toby to his mouth and took a hearty draught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as he stood upright with his head flung back and his portly chest thrown out you would have seen that gabriels lower man was clothed in military gear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glancing at the wall beyond there might have been espied hanging on their several pegs a cap and feather broadsword sash and coat of scarlet which any man learned in such matters would have known from their make and pattern to be the uniform of a serjeant in the royal east london volunteers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the locksmith put his mug down empty on the bench whence it had smiled on him before he glanced at these articles with a laughing eye and looking at them with his head a little on one side as though he would get them all into a focus said leaning time was now i remember when i was like to run mad with the desire to wear a coat of that colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any one except my father had called me a fool for my pains how i should have fired ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man at your time of life varden should know better why what a ridiculous woman you are martha said the locksmith turning round with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i i mean began the locksmith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said his wife i know what you mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you speak quite plain enough to be understood varden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its very kind of you to adapt tut tut martha rejoined the locksmith dont take offence at nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean how strange it is of you to run down volunteering when its done to defend you and all the other women its unchristian cried mrs varden shaking her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs varden looked at the ceiling as in expectation that the consequence of this profanity would be the immediate descent of the fourpost bedstead on the second floor together with the best sittingroom on the first but no visible judgment occurring she heaved a deep sigh and begged her husband in a tone of resignation to go on and by all means to blaspheme as much as possible because he knew she liked it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the locksmith did for a moment seem disposed to gratify her but he i was going to say what on earth do you call it unchristian for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which would be most unchristian marthato sit quietly down and let our houses be sacked by a foreign army or to turn out like men and drive em off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shouldnt i be a nice sort of a christian if i crept into a corner of my own chimney and looked on while a parcel when he said or you mrs varden despite herself relaxed into a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in such a state of things as that indeed she simpered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well that would be the state of things directly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some black tambourine player with a great turban on would be bearing her off and unless the tambourineplayer was proof against kicking and scratching its my belief hed have the worst of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt have him interfered with on any account poor fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here the locksmith laughed again so heartily that tears came into his eyesmuch to mrs vardens indignation who thought the capture of so sound a protestant and estimable a private character as miggs by a pagan negro a circumstance too shocking and awful for contemplation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the picture gabriel had drawn indeed threatened serious consequences and would indubitably have led to them but luckily at that moment a light footstep crossed the threshold and dolly running in threw her arms round her old fathers neck and hugged him tight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how well you look how well she looked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why if he had exhausted every laudatory adjective in the dictionary it wouldnt have been praise enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when and where was there ever such a plump roguish comely brighteyed enticing bewitching captivating maddening little puss in all this world as dolly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was the dolly of five years ago to the dolly of that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many coachmakers saddlers cabinetmakers and professors of other useful arts had deserted their fathers mothers sisters brothers and most of all their cousins for the love of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many unknown gentlemensupposed to be of mighty fortunes if not titleshad waited round the corner after dark and tempted miggs the incorruptible with golden guineas to deliver offers of marriage folded up in loveletters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many disconsolate fathers and substantial tradesmen had waited on the locksmith for the same purpose with dismal tales of how their sons had lost their appetites and taken to shut themselves up in dark bedrooms and wandering in desolate suburbs with pale faces and all because of dolly vardens loveliness and cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many young men in all previous times of unprecedented steadiness had turned suddenly wild and wicked for the same reason and in an ecstasy of unrequited love taken to wrench off doorknockers and invert the boxes of rheumatic watchmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how had she recruited the kings service both by sea and land through rendering desperate his loving subjects between the ages of eighteen and twentyfive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many young ladies had publicly professed with tears in their eyes that for their tastes she was much too short too tall too bold too cold too stout too thin too fair too darktoo everything but handsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many old ladies taking counsel together had thanked heaven their daughters were not like her and had hoped she might come to no harm and had thought she would come to no good and had wondered what people saw in her and had arrived at the conclusion that she was going off in her looks or had never come on in them and that she was a thorough imposition and a popular mistake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet here was this same dolly varden so whimsical and hard to please that she was dolly varden still all smiles and dimples and pleasant looks and caring no more for the fifty or sixty young fellows who at that very moment were breaking their hearts to marry her than if so many oysters had been crossed in love and opened afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dolly hugged her father as has been already stated and having hugged her mother also accompanied both into the little parlour where the cloth was already laid for dinner and where miss miggs a trifle more rigid and bony than of yorereceived her with a sort of hysterical gasp intended for a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into the hands of that young virgin she delivered her bonnet and walking dress all of a dreadful artful and designing kind and then said with a laugh which rivalled the locksmiths music how glad i always am to be and how glad we always are doll said her father putting back the dark hair from her sparkling eyes to have you at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give if there had been anybody of the male kind there to see her do it but there was notit was a mercy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont like your being at the warren said the locksmith i cant bear to have you out of my sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what is the news over what news there is i think you know already replied his come come said dolly you know very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to tell me why mr haredaleoh how gruff he is again to be sure!has been away from home for some days past and why he is travelling about we know he is travelling because of his letters without miss emma doesnt want to know ill swear returned the locksmith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know that said dolly but i do at any rate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why is he so secret and what is this ghost story which nobody is to tell miss emma and which seems to be mixed up with what the story means or is or has to do with it i know no more than you my dear returned the locksmith except that its some foolish fear of little solomonswhich has indeed no meaning in yes said dolly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i believe resumed the locksmith pinching her cheek on business doll <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what it may be is quite another matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> read blue beard and dont be too curious pet its no business of yours or mine depend upon that and heres dinner which is much dolly might have remonstrated against this summary dismissal of the subject notwithstanding the appearance of dinner but at the mention of blue beard mrs varden interposed protesting she could not find it in her conscience to sit tamely by and hear her child recommended to peruse the adventures of a turk and mussulmanfar less of a fabulous turk which she considered that potentate to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she held that in such stirring and tremendous times as those in which they lived it would be much more to the purpose if dolly became a regular subscriber to the thunderer where she would have an opportunity of reading lord george gordons speeches word for word which would be a greater comfort and solace to her than a hundred and fifty blue beards ever could impart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she appealed in support of this proposition to miss miggs then in waiting who said that indeed the peace of mind she had derived from the perusal of that paper generally but especially of one article of the very last week as ever was entitled great britain drenched in gore exceeded all belief the same composition she added had also wrought such a comforting effect on the mind of a married sister of hers then resident at golden lion court number twentysivin second bellhandle on the righthand doorpost that being in a delicate state of health and in fact expecting an addition to her family she had been seized with fits directly after its perusal and had raved of the inquisition ever since to the great improvement of her husband and friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss miggs went on to say that she would recommend all those whose hearts were hardened to hear lord george themselves whom she commended first in respect of his steady protestantism then of his oratory then of his eyes then of his nose then of his legs and lastly of his figure generally which she looked upon as fit for any statue prince or angel to which sentiment mrs varden fully subscribed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs varden having cut in looked at a box upon the mantelshelf painted in imitation of a very redbrick dwellinghouse with a yellow roof having at top a real chimney down which voluntary subscribers dropped their silver gold or pence into the parlour and on the door the counterfeit presentment of a brass plate whereon was legibly inscribed protestant associationand looking at it said that it was to her a source of poignant misery to think that varden never had of all his substance dropped anything into that temple save once in secretas she afterwards discoveredtwo fragments of tobaccopipe which she hoped would not be put down to his last account <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that dolly she was grieved to say was no less backward in her contributions better loving as it seemed to purchase ribbons and such gauds than to encourage the great cause then in such heavy tribulation and that she did entreat her her father she much feared could not be moved not to despise but imitate the bright example of miss miggs who flung her wages as it were into the very countenance of the pope and bruised his features with her quarters money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh mim said miggs dont relude to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no intentions mim that nobody should know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such sacrifices as i can make are quite a widders mite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all i have cried miggs with a great burst of tearsfor with her they never came on by degreesbut this was quite true though not perhaps in the sense that miggs intended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she never failed to keep her selfdenial full in mrs vardens view it drew forth so many gifts of caps and gowns and other articles of dress that upon the whole the redbrick house was perhaps the best investment for her small capital she could possibly have hit upon returning her interest at the rate of seven or eight per cent in money and fifty at least in personal repute and credit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you neednt cry miggs said mrs varden herself in tears you neednt be ashamed of it though your poor mistress is on the same miggs howled at this remark in a peculiarly dismal way and said she knowed that master hated her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it was a dreadful thing to live in families and have dislikes and not give satisfactions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that to make divisions was a thing she could not abear to think of neither could her feelings let her do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that if it was masters wishes as she and him should part it was best they should part and she hoped he might be the happier for it and always wished him well and that he might find somebody as would meet his dispositions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be a hard trial she said to part from such a missis but she could meet any suffering when her conscience told her she was in the rights and therefore she was willing even to go that lengths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not think she added that she could long survive the separations but as she was hated and looked upon unpleasant perhaps her dying as soon as possible would be the best endings for all parties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this affecting conclusion miss miggs shed more tears and sobbed abundantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said his wife in a solemn voice laying down her knife and fork <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not very well my dear rejoined the locksmith but i try dont let there be words on my account mim sobbed miggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its much the best that we should part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt stayoh gracious me!and make dissensions not for a annual gold mine and found in lest the reader should be at any loss to discover the cause of miss miggss deep emotion it may be whispered apart that happening to be listening as her custom sometimes was when gabriel and his wife conversed together she had heard the locksmiths joke relative to the foreign black who played the tambourine and bursting with the spiteful feelings which the taunt awoke in her fair breast exploded in the manner we have witnessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matters having now arrived at a crisis the locksmith as usual and for the sake of peace and quietness gave in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont hate you i dont hate anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dry your eyes and make yourself agreeable in the allied powers deeming it good generalship to consider this a sufficient apology on the part of the enemy and confession of having been in the wrong did dry their eyes and take it in good part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss miggs observed that she bore no malice no not to her greatest foe whom she rather loved the more indeed the greater persecution she sustained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs varden approved of this meek and forgiving spirit in high terms and incidentally declared as a closing article of agreement that dolly should accompany her to the clerkenwell branch of the association that very night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was an extraordinary instance of her great prudence and policy having had this end in view from the first and entertaining a secret misgiving that the locksmith who was bold when dolly was in question would object she had backed miss miggs up to this point in order that she might have him at a disadvantage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the manoeuvre succeeded so well that gabriel only made a wry face and with the warning he had just had fresh in his mind did not dare to say one word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the difference ended therefore in miggs being presented with a gown by mrs varden and halfacrown by dolly as if she had eminently distinguished herself in the paths of morality and goodness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to custom expressed her hope that varden would take a lesson from what had passed and learn more generous conduct for the time to come and the dinner being now cold and nobodys appetite very much improved by what had passed as there was to be a grand parade of the royal east london volunteers that afternoon the locksmith did no more work but sat down comfortably with his pipe in his mouth and his arm round his pretty daughters waist looking lovingly on mrs v <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from time to time and exhibiting from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot one smiling surface of good humour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to be sure when it was time to dress him in his regimentals and dolly hanging about him in all kinds of graceful winning ways helped to button and buckle and brush him up and get him into one of the tightest coats that ever was made by mortal tailor he was the proudest father in all england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the locksmith to mrs varden who stood by with folded handsrather proud of her husband toowhile miggs held his cap and sword at arms length as if mistrusting that the latter might run some one through the body of its own dolly didnt ask why not or say a word indeed but stooped her head down very low to tie his sash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never wear this dress said honest gabriel but i think of poor joe willet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i loved joe he was always a favourite of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dolly laughednot like herself at allthe strangest little laugh that could beand held her head down lower still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> resumed the locksmith muttering to himself i always wish he had come to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might have made it up between them if he had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old john made a great mistake in his way of acting by that lada great mistake.have you nearly tied that sash my what an illmade sash it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there it was loose again and trailing on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dolly was obliged to kneel down and recommence at the beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never mind young willet varden said his wife frowning you miss miggs gave a great sniff to the same effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay martha cried the locksmith dont let us bear too hard upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the lad is dead indeed well deal kindly by his a runaway and a vagabond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a runaway my dear but not a vagabond returned the locksmith in a gentle tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he behaved himself well did joealwaysand was mrs varden coughedand so did miggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried hard to gain your good opinion martha i can tell you said the locksmith smiling and stroking his chin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems but yesterday that he followed me out to the maypole door one night and begged me not to say how like a boy they used himsay here at home he meant though at the time i recollect i didnt understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said gabriel turning sharply to her why if here ant miss dolly said the handmaid stooping down to look into her face agiving way to floods of tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raly its give me such a turn cried the susceptible damsel pressing her hand upon her side to quell the palpitation of her the locksmith after glancing at miss miggs as if he could have wished to have a feather brought straightway looked on with a broad stare while dolly hurried away followed by that sympathising young woman then turning to his wife stammered out is dolly your fault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hears um say dat dares no slaves way over in dem parts is um so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i quietly said i have heard the same thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well continued he as he threw down the boot and brush and placing his hands in his pockets strutted across the floor with an air of independencegorra mighty dem is de parts for pompey and i hope when you get dare you will stay and nebber follow dat buckra back to dis hot quarter no more let him be eber so good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thanked him and just as i took the boots up and started off he caught my hand between his two and gave it a hearty shake and with tears god bless you broder and may de lord be wid you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you gets de freedom and sitin under your own wine and figtree dont forget to pray for poor pompey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was afraid to say much to him but i shall never forget his earnest request nor fail to do what little i can to release the millions of unhappy bondmen of whom he was one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the proper time my master had the poultices placed on came down and seated himself at a table in a very brilliant diningroom to have his dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to have something at the same time in order to be ready for the boat so they gave me my dinner in an old broken plate with a rusty knife and fork and said here boy you go in the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took it and went out but did not stay more than a few minutes because i was in a great hurry to get back to see how the invalid was getting on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on arriving i found two or three servants waiting on him but as he did not feel able to make a very hearty dinner he soon finished paid the bill and gave the servants each a trifle which caused one of them to say to me your massa is a big bugmeaning a gentleman of distinction he is the greatest gentleman dat has been dis way for dis six months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said yes he is some pumpkins meaning the same as big bug <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was scared for i was fond of toby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we never said much to each other but we fiddled together and musics as good as did toby die of yellow fever?una asked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went down to the city and bled em well again in heaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sent back word by red jacket that if there was war or he died i was to bring the oils along to the city but till then i was to go on working in the garden and red jacket was to see me do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down at heart all indians reckon digging a squaws business and neither him nor cornplanter when he relieved watch was a hard taskmaster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hired a niggerboy to do our work and a lazy grinning runagate he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i found toby didnt die the minute he reached town why boylike i took him off my mind and went with my indians again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those days up north at canasedago running races and gambling with the senecas or beehunting in the woods or fishing in the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its best he went on suddenly after the first frosts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you roll out o your blanket and find every leaf left green over night turned red and yellow not by trees at a time but hundreds and hundreds of miles of em like sunsets splattered upside down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one of such days the maples was flaming scarlet and gold and the sumach bushes were redder cornplanter and red jacket came out in full wardress making the very leaves look silly feathered warbonnets yellow doeskin leggings fringed and tasselled red horseblankets and their bridles feathered and shelled and beaded no bounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it was war against the british till i saw their faces werent painted and they only carried wristwhips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they told me they was going to visit big hand and find out for sure whether he meant to join the french in fighting the english or make a peace treaty with england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon those two would ha gone out on the warpath at a nod from big hand but they knew well if there was war twixt england and the united states their tribe ud catch it from both parties same as in all the other wars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they asked me to come along and hold the ponies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that puzzled me because they always put their ponies up at the buck or epplys when they went to see general washington in the city and horseholding is a niggers dyou mean you were dressed like an indian?dan demanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this didnt happen at lebanon he said but a bit farther north on the reservation and at that particular moment of time so far as blanket hairband moccasins and sunburn went there wasnt much odds twix me and a young seneca buck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may laugh he smoothed down his longskirted brown coat but i told you i took to their ways all over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said nothing though i was bursting to let out the no and you dont let out one here either said puck before we went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went on forty fifty miles a day for days on end we three braves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how a great tall indian ahorseback can carry his warbonnet at a canter through thick timber without brushing a feather beats me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my silly head was banged often enough by low branches but they slipped through like running elk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had evening hymnsinging every night after theyd blown their pipesmoke to the quarters of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill tell you but dont blame me if youre no wiser <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we took the old wartrail from the end of the lake along the east susquehanna through the nantego country right down to fort shamokin on the senachse river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we crossed the juniata by fort granville got into shippensberg over the hills by the ochwick trail and then to williams ferry its a bad one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from williams ferry across the shanedore over the blue mountains through ashbys gap and so southeast by south from there till we found the president at the back of his own plantations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id hate to be trailed by indians in earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they caught him like a partridge on a stump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after wed left our ponies we scouted forward through a woody piece and creeping slower and slower at last if my moccasins even slipped red jacket ud turn and frown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard voices monsieur genets for choice long before i saw anything and we pulled up at the edge of a clearing where some niggers in greyandred liveries were holding horses and halfa dozen gentlemen but one was genet were talking among felled timber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fancy theyd come to see genet a piece on his road for his portmantle was with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hid in between two logs as near to the company as i be to that old windlass there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt need anybody to show me big hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood up very still his legs a little apart listening to genet that french ambassador which never had more manners than a bosham tinker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> genet was as good as ordering him to declare war on england at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had heard that clack before on the embuscade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said hed stir up the whole united states to have war with england whether big hand liked it or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> big hand heard him out to the last end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked behind me and my two chiefs had vanished like smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says big hand that is very forcibly put monsieur genet citizen citizen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> citizen genet he says you may be sure it will receive my fullest consideration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this seemed to take citizen genet back a piece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rode off grumbling and never gave his nigger a penny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others all assembled round big hand then and in their way they said pretty much what genet had said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they put it to him here was france and england at war in a manner of speaking right across the united states stomach and paying no regards to any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the french was searching american ships on pretence they was helping england but really for to steal the goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the english was doing the same only tother way round and besides searching they was pressing american citizens into their navy to help them fight france on pretence that those americans was lawful british subjects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his gentlemen put this very clear to big hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it didnt look to them they said as though the united states trying to keep out of the fight was any advantage to her because she only catched it from both french and english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they said that nine out of ten good americans was crazy to fight the english then and there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wouldnt say whether that was right or wrong they only wanted big hand to turn it over in his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw red jacket and cornplanter watching him from the far side of the clearing and how they had slipped round there was another mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no nor yet was it what you might call swearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he he blasted em with his natural speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked them halfadozen times over whether the united states had enough armed ships for any shape or sort of war with any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked em if they thought she had those ships to give him those ships and they looked on the ground as if they expected to find em there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put it to em whether setting ships aside their country i reckon he gave em good reasons whether the united states was ready or able to face a new big war she having but so few years back wound up one against england and being all holds full of her own troubles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i said the strong way he laid it all before em blasted em and when hed done it was like a still in the woods after a storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little man but they all looked little pipes up like a young rook in a bloweddown nest nevertheless general it seems you will be compelled to fight england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quick big hand wheeled on him and is there anything in my past which makes you think i am averse to fighting great britain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any price says he word by word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our ships will be searched our citizens will be pressed but then what about the declaration of independence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deal with facts not fancies says big hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the united states are in no position to fight england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but think of public opinion another one starts up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the feeling in philadelphia alone is at fever heat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held up one of his big hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gentlemen he says slow he spoke but his voice carried far i have to think of our country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me assure you that the treaty with great britain will be made though every city in the union burn me in effigy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know too that more than once george sand came very near losing all patience with him so that we can sympathize i have had my fill of great men excuse the expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i prefer to see them all in plutarch as they would not then cause me any suffering on the human side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may they all be carved in marble or cast in bronze but may i hear no more about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what disgusted george sand with her michel was his vanity and his craving for adulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in july she had come to the end of her patience as she wrote to girerd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was one of her peculiarities to always take a third person into her confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the time of sandeau this third person was emile regnault at the time of musset saintebeuve and now it was girerd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am tired out with my own devotion and i have fought against my pride with all the strength of my love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have had nothing but ingratitude and hardness as my recompense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have felt my love dying away and my soul being crushed but i am cured at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if only she had had all this suffering for the sake of a great man but this time it was only in imaginary great man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the influence though that he had had over her thought was real and in a certain way beneficial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the beginning she was far from sharing michels ideas and for some of them she felt an aversion which amounted to horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dogma of absolute equality seemed an absurdity to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the republic or rather the various republics then in gestation appeared to her a sort of utopia and as she saw each of her friends making his own little republic for himself she had not much faith in the virtue of that form of government for uniting all french people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one point shocked her above all others in michels theories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as the revolution did not find chemists necessary he considered that the republic did not need writers painters and musicians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were all useless individuals and the republic would give them a little surprise by putting a labourers spade or a shoemakers awl into their hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george sand considered this idea not only barbarous but silly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time works wonders for we have an indisputable proof that certain of his opinions soon became hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this proof is the republican catechism contained in her letters to her son maurice who was then twelve years of age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was at the lycee henri iv in the same class as the princes of orleans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is interesting to read what his mother says to him concerning the father of his young school friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a letter written in december she says it is certainly true that louisphilippe is the enemy of humanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little later the enemy of humanity invites the young friends of his son montpensier to his chateau for the carnival holiday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maurice is allowed to accept the invitation as he wishes to but he is to avoid showing that gratitude which destroys independence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the entertainments that montpensier offers you are favours writes this mother of the gracchi quite gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he is asked about his opinions the child is to reply that he is rather too young to have opinions yet but not too young to know what opinions he will have when he is free to have them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can reply says his mother that you are republican by race and by nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> princes are our natural enemies she says and then again however goodhearted the child of a king may be he is destined to be a tyrant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this is certainly a great commotion to make about her little son accepting a glass of fruit syrup and a few cakes at the house of a schoolfellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but george sand was then under the domination of robespierre in person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> michel had brought george sand over to republicanism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without wishing to exaggerate the service he had rendered her by this it appears to me that it certainly was one if we look at it in one way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rightly or wrongly george sand had seen in michel the man who devotes himself entirely to a cause of general interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had learnt something in his school and perhaps all the more thoroughly because it was in his school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had learnt that love is in any case a selfish passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had learnt that another object must be given to the forces of sympathy of a generous heart and that such an object may be the service of humanity devotion to an idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a turn in the road and led the writer on to leave the personal style for the impersonal style <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was another service too which michel had rendered to george sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had pleaded for her in her petition for separation from her husband and she had won her case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever since george sand had taken back her independence in her intercourse with dudevant had not been disagreeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he came to paris he made no attempt to stay with his wife lest he should inconvenience her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall put up at hippolytes he says in his letter to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not want to inconvenience you in the least nor to be inconvenienced myself which is quite natural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she started for italy he begs her to take advantage of so good an opportunity for seeing such a beautiful country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was also a husband ready to give good advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later on he invited pagello to spend a little time at nohant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was certainly the climax in this strange story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the months though that the husband and wife were together again at nohant the scenes began once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dudevants irritability was increased by the fact that he was always short of money and that he was aware of his own deplorable shortcomings as a financial administrator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had made speculations which had been disastrous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very credulous as so many suspicious people are and he had been duped by a swindler in an affair of maritime armaments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had had all the more faith in this enterprise because a picture of the boat had been shown him on paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had spent ninety thousand francs of the hundred thousand he had had and was now living on his wifes income <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george sand paid his debts first and the husband and wife then signed an agreement to the effect that their respective property should be separated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dudevant regretted having signed this afterwards and it was torn up after a violent scene which took place before witnesses in october the pretext of this scene had been an order given to maurice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a series of letters which have never hitherto been published george sand relates the various incidents of this affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we give some of the more important passages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following letter is to her halfbrother hippolyte who used to be casimirs drinking companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friend i am about to tell you some news which will reach you indirectly and that you had better hear first from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of carrying out our agreement pleasantly and loyally casimir is acting with the most insane animosity towards me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without my giving him any reason for such a thing either by my conduct or my manner of treating him he endeavoured to strike me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was prevented by five persons one of whom was dutheil and he then fetched his gun to shoot me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im blest if she shouldnt have had a dozen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im allus ungry was the answer but taint so bad as it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come in here said the woman and she held open the shopdoor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be invited into a warm place full of bread seemed an incredible thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not know what was going to happen she did not care even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get yourself warm said the woman pointing to a fire in a tiny back room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and look here when youre hard up for a bite of bread you can come here and ask for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im blest if i wont give it to you for that young uns sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sara found some comfort in her remaining bun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was hot and it was a great deal better than nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she broke off small pieces and ate them slowly to make it last longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose it was a magic bun she said and a bite was as much as a whole dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should be over eating myself if i went on like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was dark when she reached the square in which miss minchins select seminary was situated the lamps were lighted and in most of the windows gleams of light were to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it always interested sara to catch glimpses of the rooms before the shutters were closed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she liked to imagine things about people who sat before the fires in the houses or who bent over books at the tables <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was for instance the large family opposite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shut off the power and backed up and stood over them and then we see that they was all dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it made us hush down too and talk low like people at a funeral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dropped down slow and stopped and me and tom clumb down and went among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they was dried by the sun and dark and shriveled and leathery like the pictures of mummies you see in books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet they looked just as human you wouldnt a believed it just like they was asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of the people and animals was partly covered with sand but most of them not for the sand was thin there and the bed was gravel and hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the clothes had rotted away and when you took hold of a rag it tore with a touch like spider web <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom reckoned they had been laying there for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of the men had rusty guns by them some had swords on and had shawl belts with long silver mounted pistols stuck in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the camels had their loads on yet but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt the freight out on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we didnt reckon the swords was any good to the dead people any more so we took one apiece and some pistols <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we took a small box too because it was so handsome and inlaid so fine and then we wanted to bury the people but there warnt no way to do it that we could think of and nothing to do it with but sand and that would blow away again of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we mounted high and sailed away and pretty soon that black spot on the sand was out of sight and we wouldnt ever see them poor people again in this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we wondered and reasoned and tried to guess how they come to be there and how it all hap pened to them but we couldnt make it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first we thought maybe they got lost and wandered around and about till their food and water give out and they starved to death but tom said no wild animals nor vultures hadnt meddled with them and so that guess wouldnt do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so at last we give it up and judged we wouldnt think about it no more because it made us lowspirited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we opened the box and it had gems and jewels in it quite a pile and some little veils of the kind the dead women had on with fringes made out of curious gold money that we warnt acquainted with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we wondered if we better go and try to find them again and give it back but tom thought it over and said no it was a country that was full of robbers and they would come and steal it and then the sin would be on us for putting the temptation in their way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we went on but i wished we had took all they had so there wouldnt a been no temptation at all left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had had two hours of that blazing weather down there and was dreadful thirsty when we got aboard again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went straight for the water but it was spoiled and bitter besides being pretty near hot enough to scald your mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was mississippi river water the best in the world and we stirred up the mud in it to see if that would help but no the mud wasnt any better than the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well we hadnt been so very very thirsty before while we was interested in the lost people but we was now and as soon as we found we couldnt have a drink we was more than thirtyfive times as thirsty as we was a quarter of a minute before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why in a little while we wanted to hold our mouths open and pant like a dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom said to keep a sharp lookout all around every wheres because wed got to find an oasis or there warnt no telling what would happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he crope in and the next minute out he come again with huck its gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ground is trampled some but if there was any blood its all washed away by the storm for its all puddles and slush in there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last i give in and went and took a look myself and it was just as tom said there wasnt a sign of a corpse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dern it i says the dimonds is gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you reckon the thieves slunk back and lugged him off tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now whered they hide him do you reckon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know i says disgusted and whats more i dont care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyve got the boots and thats all i cared about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell lay around these woods a long time before i hunt him up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom didnt feel no more intrust in him neither only curiosity to know what come of him but he said wed lay low and keep dark and it wouldnt be long till the dogs or somebody rousted him out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went back home to breakfast ever so bothered and put out and disappointed and swindled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i warnt ever so down on a corpse before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aunt sally she looked old and tired and let the children snarl and fuss at one another and didnt seem to notice it was going on which wasnt her usual style me and tom had a plenty to think about without talking benny she looked like she hadnt had much sleep and whenever shed lift her head a little and steal a look towards her father you could see there was tears in her eyes and as for the old man his things stayed on his plate and got cold without him knowing they was there i reckon for he was thinking and thinking all the time and never said a word and never et a bite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon i better go and find it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you go over that way and ill hunt around by the spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no you neednt come huck we can find it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so huck sat down again and waited an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he found it lonesome and went to find his comrades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were wide apart in the woods both very pale both fast asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not talkative at supper that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had a humble look and when huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs they said no they were not feeling very well something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about midnight joe awoke and called the boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys huddled them selves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently there came a quiver ing glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by another came a little stronger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks and shuddered with the fancy that the spirit of the night had gone by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade separate and distinct that grew about their feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it showed three white startled faces too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sweep of chilly air passed by rustling all the leaves and snow ing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops right over the boys heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they clung together in terror in the thick gloom that followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few big raindrops fell patter ing upon the leaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sprang away stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark no two plunging in the same direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a furious blast roared through the trees making every thing sing as it went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one blinding flash after another came and peal on peal of deafening thunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys cried out to each other but the roaring wind and the boom ing thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how ever one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent cold scared and streaming with water but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not talk the old sail flapped so furiously even if the other noises would have allowed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tempest rose higher and higher and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys seized each others hands and fled with many tumblings and bruises to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness the bending trees the billowy river white with foam the driving spray of spumeflakes the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth and the unflagging thunder peals came now in earsplitting explosive bursts keen and sharp and unspeakably appalling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces burn it up drown it to the treetops blow it away and deafen every creature in it all at one and the same moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at last the battle was done and the forces re tired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grum blings and peace resumed her sway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys went back to camp a good deal awed but they found there was still something to be thankful for because the great sycamore the shelter of their beds was a ruin now blasted by the lightnings and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything in camp was drenched the campfire as well for they were but heedless lads like their generation and had made no provision against rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was matter for dismay for they were soaked through and chilled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were eloquent in their dis tress but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting so they patiently wrought until with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of shel tered logs they coaxed the fire to burn again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roar ing furnace and were gladhearted once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dried their boiled ham and had a feast and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning for there was not a dry spot to sleep on anywhere around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the sun began to steal in upon the boys drowsiness came over them and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they got scorched out by and by and drearily set about getting breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the meal they felt rusty and stiffjointed and a little home sick once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom saw the signs and fell to cheer ing up the pirates as well as he could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they cared nothing for marbles or circus or swimming or any thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reminded them of the imposing secret and raised a ray of cheer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while it lasted he got them in terested in a new device <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was to knock off being pirates for a while and be indians for a change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were attracted by this idea so it was not long before they were stripped and striped from head to heel with black mud like so many zebras all of them chiefs of course and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an english settlement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by they separated into three hostile tribes and darted upon each other from ambush with dread ful warwhoops and killed and scalped each other by thousands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they assembled in camp toward suppertime hungry and happy but now a difficulty arose hostile indians could not break the bread of hospitality together with out first making peace and this was a simple im possibility without smoking a pipe of peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no other process that ever they had heard of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however there was no other way so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed in due form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and behold they were glad they had gone into savagery for they had gained something they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no they practised cautiously after supper with right fair success and so they spent a jubilant evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the six nations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will leave them to smoke and chat ter and brag since we have no further use for them at present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil saturday afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harpers and aunt pollys family were being put into mourning with great grief and many tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an unusual quiet possessed the village although it was or dinarily quiet enough in all conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air and talked little but they sighed often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had no heart in their sports and gradually gave them up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the afternoon becky thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard and feeling very melancholy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were the same ladies and the same gentlemen who had been on the sands in the morning and on the pier the day before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were young ladies in marooncoloured gowns and black velvet bracelets dispensing fancy articles in the shop and presiding over games of chance in the concertroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were marriageable daughters and marriagemaking mammas gaming and promenading and turning over music and flirting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were some male beaux doing the sentimental in whispers and others doing the ferocious in moustache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tuggs in amber miss tuggs in skyblue mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was captain waters in a braided surtout there was mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs in pumps and a gilt waistcoat there was mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joseph tuggs in a blue coat and a shirtfrill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried one of the young ladies in the marooncoloured gowns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> echoed another young lady in the same uniform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> number threes gone said the first young lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> number eights gone mary ann said the first young lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the numbers are all taken now ladies if you please said the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the representatives of numbers three eight and eleven and the rest of the numbers crowded round the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the presiding goddess handing the dicebox to the eldest daughter of a stout lady with four girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a profound silence among the lookerson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> throw jane my dear said the stout lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an interesting display of bashfulness a little blushing in a cambric handkerchief a whispering to a younger sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amelia my dear throw for your sister said the stout lady and then she turned to a walking advertisement of rowlands macassar oil who stood next her and said jane is so very modest and retiring but i cant be angry with her for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an artless and unsophisticated girl is so truly amiable that i often wish amelia the gentleman with the whiskers whispered his admiring approval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss amelia threw eight for her sister ten for herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nice figure amelia whispered the stout lady to a thin youth beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can not help admiring that life and vivacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sigh i wish i could make the young gentleman cordially acquiesced in the sentiment both he and the individual first addressed were perfectly contented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain waters as a short female in a blue velvet hat and feathers was led into the orchestra by a fat man in black tights and cloudy berlins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tippin of the london theatres replied belinda referring to the programme of the concert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the talented tippin having condescendingly acknowledged the clapping of hands and shouts of bravo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which greeted her appearance proceeded to sing the popular cavatina of bid me discourse accompanied on the piano by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tippin sang a comic song accompanied on the piano by mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tippin the applause consequent upon which was only to be exceeded by the enthusiastic approbation bestowed upon an air with variations on the guitar by miss tippin accompanied on the chin by master tippin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus passed the evening thus passed the days and evenings of the tuggses and the waterses for six weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sands in the morning donkeys at noon pier in the afternoon library at night and the same people everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on that very night six weeks the moon was shining brightly over the calm sea which dashed against the feet of the tall gaunt cliffs with just enough noise to lull the old fish to sleep without disturbing the young ones when two figures were discernible or would have been if anybody had looked for them seated on one of the wooden benches which are stationed near the verge of the western cliff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon had climbed higher into the heavens by two hours journeying since those figures first sat down and yet they had moved not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowd of loungers had thinned and dispersed the noise of itinerant musicians had died away light after light had appeared in the windows of the different houses in the distance blockademan after blockademan had passed the spot wending his way towards his solitary post and yet those figures had remained stationary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some portions of the two forms were in deep shadow but the light of the moon fell strongly on a pucecoloured boot and a glazed stock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they spoke not but were silently gazing on the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs sighed like a gust of wind through a forest of oh cymon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> resumed belinda the chaste delight the calm happiness of this one week of platonic love is too much for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon was about to suggest that it was too little for him but he stopped himself and murmured unintelligibly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to think that even this gleam of happiness innocent as it oh do not say for ever belinda exclaimed the excitable cymon as two stronglydefined tears chased each other down his pale face it was so long that there was plenty of room for a chase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such platonic acquaintance as ours is my husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jealous and revengeful ferocious in his revenge a maniac in his jealousy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs in a voice broken by emotion expressed his disinclination to undergo the process of assassination before the eyes of anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs sadly offered the lady his arm and escorted her to her lodgings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused at the door he felt a platonic pressure of his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs again when he reached the drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied belinda and if at any period of my life i hush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady paused and stared with a steady gaze of horror on the ashy countenance of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a double knock at the streetdoor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said belinda as the captains voice was heard below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> added cymon tuggs as the voices of his relatives floated up the staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain waters pointing to the window before which some chintz hangings were closely drawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have done nothing wrong said the hesitating cymon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reiterated the frantic lady you will be murdered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this last appeal to his feelings was irresistible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dismayed cymon concealed himself behind the curtain with pantomimic suddenness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two iron shod boots and one gruff voice were heard by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon to advance and acknowledge the honour of the introduction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sabre of the lieutenant rattled heavily upon the floor as he seated himself at the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were going to make a night of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs was pent up behind the curtain and afraid to breathe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs never could smoke without feeling it indispensably necessary to retire immediately and never could smell smoke without a strong disposition to cough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cigars were introduced the captain was a professed smoker so was the lieutenant so was joseph tuggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the apartment was small the door was closed the smoke powerful it hung in heavy wreaths over the room and at length found its way behind the curtain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs held his nose his mouth his breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all of no use out came the cough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the captain i beg your pardon miss tuggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cigars resumed more smoke another cough smothered but violent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lieutenant slaughter looked first at one person mysteriously then at another then laid down his cigar then approached the window on tiptoe and pointed with his right thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the curtain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ejaculated the captain rising from table what do the lieutenant in reply drew back the curtain and discovered mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs behind it pallid with apprehension and blue with wanting to cough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roared the captain slaughter unhand me the murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs and all the ladies forthwith fainted away and formed a tableau <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most willingly would we conceal the disastrous termination of the six weeks acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a troublesome form and an arbitrary custom however prescribe that a story should have a conclusion in addition to a commencement we have therefore no alternative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lieutenant slaughter brought a message the captain brought an action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cymon tuggs recovered from the nervous disorder into which misplaced affection and exciting circumstances had plunged him he found that his family had lost their pleasant acquaintance that his father was minus fifteen hundred pounds and the captain plus the precise sum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the money was paid to hush the matter up but it got abroad notwithstanding and there are not wanting some who affirm that three designing impostors never found more easy dupes than did captain waters mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> waters and lieutenant slaughter in the tuggses at ramsgate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed my love he paid teresa very great attention on the last assembly night said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton addressing her spouse who after the fatigues of the day in the city was sitting with a silk handkerchief over his head and his feet on the fender drinking his port very great attention and i say again every possible encouragement ought to be given him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why you know whom i mean my dear the young man with the black whiskers and the white cravat who has just come out at our assembly and whom all the girls are talking about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton addressing her youngest daughter who was engaged in netting a purse and looking sentimental <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horatio sparkins ma replied miss marianne with a sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes to be sure horatio sparkins said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> decidedly the most gentlemanlike young man i ever saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure in the beautifullymade coat he wore the other night he looked like prince leopold ma so noble so full of sentiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suggested marianne in a tone of enthusiastic admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton that teresa is now eightandtwenty and that it really is very miss teresa malderton was a very little girl rather fat with vermilion cheeks but goodhumoured and still disengaged although to do her justice the misfortune arose from no lack of perseverance on her part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain had she flirted for ten years in vain had mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton assiduously kept up an extensive acquaintance among the young eligible bachelors of camberwell and even of wandsworth and brixton to say nothing of those who dropped in from town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss malderton was as well known as the lion on the top of northumberland house and had an equal chance of i am quite sure youd like him continued mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has a great respect for you my dear said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes im sure hes very much attached to pas society said miss marianne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed he said as much to me in confidence observed mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton somewhat flattered if i see him at the assembly tomorrow perhaps ill ask him down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope ill see about it said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton was a man whose whole scope of ideas was limited to lloyds the exchange the india house and the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few successful speculations had raised him from a situation of obscurity and comparative poverty to a state of affluence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as frequently happens in such cases the ideas of himself and his family became elevated to an extraordinary pitch as their means increased they affected fashion taste and many other fooleries in imitation of their betters and had a very decided and becoming horror of anything which could by possibility be considered low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was hospitable from ostentation illiberal from ignorance and prejudiced from conceit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> egotism and the love of display induced him to keep an excellent table convenience and a love of good things of this life ensured him plenty of guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he liked to have clever men or what he considered such at his table because it was a great thing to talk about but he never could endure what he called sharp fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> probably he cherished this feeling out of compliment to his two sons who gave their respected parent no uneasiness in that particular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the family were ambitious of forming acquaintances and connexions in some sphere of society superior to that in which they themselves moved and one of the necessary consequences of this desire added to their utter ignorance of the world beyond their own small circle was that any one who could lay claim to an acquaintance with people of rank and title had a sure passport to the table at oak lodge camberwell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horatio sparkins at the assembly had excited no small degree of surprise and curiosity among its regular frequenters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he used very fine words and talked a great deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could he be a distinguished foreigner come to england for the purpose of describing the country its manners and customs and frequenting public balls and public dinners with the view of becoming acquainted with high life polished etiquette and english refinement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was he a surgeon a contributor to the magazines a writer of fashionable novels or an artist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no to each and all of these surmises there existed some valid objection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think he must be reasoned mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton within himself because he perceives the night succeeding the conversation we have just recorded was assembly night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doublefly was ordered to be at the door of oak lodge at nine oclock precisely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the miss maldertons were dressed in skyblue satin trimmed with artificial flowers and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who was a little fat woman in ditto ditto looked like her eldest daughter multiplied by two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frederick malderton the eldest son in fulldress costume was the very beau ideal of a smart waiter and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thomas malderton the youngest with his white dressstock blue coat bright buttons and red watchribbon strongly resembled the portrait of that interesting but rash young gentleman george barnwell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every member of the party had made up his or her mind to cultivate the acquaintance of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss teresa of course was to be as amiable and interesting as ladies of eightandtwenty on the lookout for a husband usually are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss marianne would request the favour of some verses for her album <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton would patronise the great unknown by asking him to dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom intended to ascertain the extent of his information on the interesting topics of snuff and cigars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frederick malderton himself the family authority on all points of taste dress and fashionable arrangement who had lodgings of his own in town who had a free admission to coventgarden theatre who always dressed according to the fashions of the months who went up the water twice aweek in the season and who actually had an intimate friend who once knew a gentleman who formerly lived in the albany even he had determined that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horatio sparkins must be a devilish good fellow and that he would do him the honour of challenging him to a game at billiards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first object that met the anxious eyes of the expectant family on their entrance into the ballroom was the interesting horatio with his hair brushed off his forehead and his eyes fixed on the ceiling reclining in a contemplative attitude on one of the seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said his father who checked him on all occasions probably with a view to prevent his becoming sharp which was very unnecessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elegant sparkins attitudinised with admirable effect until the family had crossed the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then started up with the most natural appearance of surprise and delight accosted mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton with the utmost cordiality saluted the young ladies in the most enchanting manner bowed to and shook hands with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton with a degree of respect amounting almost to veneration and returned the greetings of the two young men in a halfgratified halfpatronising manner which fully convinced them that he must be an important and at the same time condescending personage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss malderton said horatio after the ordinary salutations and bowing very low may i be permitted to presume to hope that you i dont think i am engaged said miss teresa with a dreadful horatio looked handsomely miserable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall be most happy simpered the interesting teresa at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horatios countenance brightened up like an old hat in a shower of rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton as the obsequious sparkins and his partner joined the quadrille which was just forming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has a remarkably good address said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he is a prime fellow interposed tom who always managed to tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said his father solemnly i think i desired you before not to be a fool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom looked as happy as a cock on a drizzly morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the interesting horatio to his partner as they promenaded the room at the conclusion of the set how delightful how refreshing it is to retire from the cloudy storms the vicissitudes and the troubles of life even if it be but for a few short fleeting moments and to spend those moments fading and evanescent though they be in the delightful the blessed society of one individual whose frowns would be death whose coldness would be madness whose falsehood would be ruin whose constancy would be bliss the possession of whose affection would what feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thought miss teresa as she leaned more heavily on her companions arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> resumed the elegant sparkins with a theatrical air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what have i i to do with sentiments like these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss malderton here he stopped short really mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sparkins returned the enraptured teresa blushing in the sweetest confusion i must refer you to papa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interrupted miss teresa well knowing there was nothing to fear but wishing to make the interview resemble a scene in some romantic novel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cannot object to my offering you a glass of negus returned the adorable sparkins with some surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a fuss about it will give me the greatest pleasure sir to see you to dinner at oak lodge camberwell on sunday next at five oclock if you have no better engagement said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malderton at the conclusion of the evening as he and his sons were standing in conversation with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horatio bowed his acknowledgments and accepted the flattering invitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must confess continued the father offering his snuffbox to his new acquaintance that i dont enjoy these assemblies half so much as the comfort i had almost said the luxury of oak lodge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed and indeed bruno i didnt mean to grin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but bruno only folded his arms and said dont tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see a little twinkle in one of oor eyesjust like the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do you think im like the moon bruno <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oor face is large and round like the moon bruno answered looking at me thoughtfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doosnt shine quite so brightbut its more cleaner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know i sometimes wash my face bruno <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried bruno and he leant forwards and added in a solemn whisper the moons face gets dirtier and dirtier every night till its black all across <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then when its dirty all overso he passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks as he spoke then she washes it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she washes it little by littleonly she begins at the other edge oo know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time he was sitting quietly on the dead mouse with his arms folded and the weeding wasnt getting on a bit so i had to say work first pleasure afterwards no more talking till that beds finished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that we had a few minutes of silence while i sorted out the pebbles and amused myself with watching brunos plan of gardening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite a new plan to me he always measured each bed before he weeded it as if he was afraid the weeding would make it shrink and once when it came out longer than he wished he set to work to thump the mouse with his little fist crying out there now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont oo keep oor tail straight when i tell oo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill tell you what ill do bruno said in a halfwhisper as we worked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i said of course i do or i shouldnt have come here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have gone to some place where there are no fairies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why oo might as well say ood go to some place where there wasnt any airsupposing oo didnt like air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a rather difficult idea to grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre nearly the first fairy i ever saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you ever seen any people besides me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we seeem when we walk in the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how is it they never tread on you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant tread on us said bruno looking amused at my ignorance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why suppose oore walking hereso making little marks on the ground and suppose theres a fairythats mewalking here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well then oo put one foot here and one foot here so oo doosnt tread on the fairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was all very well as an explanation but it didnt convince me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why shouldnt i put one foot on the fairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know why the little fellow said in a thoughtful tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody never walked on the top of a fairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ill tell oo what ill do as oore so fond of fairies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill get oo an invitation to the fairykings dinnerparty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well but thats not so nice as sitting at the table is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it isnt bruno said in a tone as if he rather pitied my ignorance but if oore not even sir anything oo cant expect to be allowed to sit at the table oo know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said as meekly as i could that i didnt expect it but it was the only way of going to a dinnerparty that i really enjoyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and bruno tossed his head and said in a rather offended tone that i might do as i pleasedthere were many he knew that would give their ears to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they invited me once last week bruno said very gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was to wash up the soupplatesno the cheeseplates i mean that was grand enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i didnt hardly make only one mistake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only bringing scissors to cut the beef with bruno said carelessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the grandest thing of all was i fetched the king a glass of cider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said biting my lip to keep myself from laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oo know it isnt every one thats had such an honour as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this set me thinking of the various queer things we call an honour in this world but which after all havent a bit more honour in them than what bruno enjoyed when he took the king a glass of cider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how long i might not have dreamed on in this way if bruno hadnt suddenly roused me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried in a state of the wildest excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant hold him more than a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was struggling desperately with a great snail clinging to one of its horns and nearly breaking his poor little back in his efforts to drag it over a blade of grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw we should have no more gardening if i let this sort of thing go on so i quietly took the snail away and put it on a bank where he couldnt reach it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well hunt it afterwards bruno i said if you really want to catch it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but whats the use of it when youve got it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats the use of a fox when oove got it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried to think of some good reason why big things should hunt foxes and he should not hunt snails but none came into my head so i said at last well i suppose ones as good as the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think oo wouldnt be so silly said bruno as to go snailhunting by oorself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why ood never get the snail along if oo hadnt somebody to hold on to his other horn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i shant go alone i said quite gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the way is that the best kind to hunt or do you recommend the ones without shells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no we never hunt the ones without shells bruno said with a little shudder at the thought of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre always so cross about it and then if oo tumbles over them theyre ever so sticky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time we had nearly finished the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had fetched some violets and bruno was just helping me to put in the last when he suddenly stopped and said im tired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fluffed and flirted and showed himself to every advantage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it never occurred to him that the dove and the woodpecker might be watching though he would not have cared in the least if they had been and as for any other cardinal he would have attacked the combined forces of the limberlost and rainbow bottom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every impulse of passion in his big crimson palpitating body was thrown into those notes but she only turned her head from side to side peering at him seeming sufficiently frightened to flee at a breath and answered not even the faintest little chook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cardinal rested a second before he tried again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that steadied him and gave him better command of himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could tell that his notes were clearing and growing sweeter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was some encouragement in the fact that she was still there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cardinal felt that his time had come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely no cardinal could sing fuller clearer sweeter notes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began at the very first and rollicked through a story of adventure colouring it with every wild dashing catchy note he could improvise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he followed that with a rippling song of the joy and fulness of spring in notes as light and airy as the windblown soul of melody and with swaying body kept time to his rhythmic measures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he glided into a song of love and tenderly pleadingly passionately told the story as only a courting bird can tell it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he sang a song of ravishment a song quavering with fear and the pain tugging at his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he almost had run the gamut and she really appeared as if she intended to flee rather than to come to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was afraid to take even one timid little hop toward her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a fit of desperation the cardinal burst into the passion song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he arose to his full height leaned toward her with outspread quivering wings and crest flared to the utmost and rocking from side to side in the intensity of his fervour he poured out a perfect torrent of palpitant song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his cardinal body swayed to the rolling flood of his ecstatic tones until he appeared like a flaming pulsing note of materialized music as he entreated coaxed commanded and pled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from sheer exhaustion he threw up his head to round off the last note he could utter and breathlessly glancing down to see if she were coming caught sight of a faint streak of gray in the distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had planned so to subdue the little female he courted that she would come to him he was in hot pursuit a half days journey away before he remembered it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet tis simple enough he said with sudden bitterness which seemed literally to surge through his words though he was making visible efforts to suppress it i humbly put the question to you for my slow wits are unable to grasp the cause of this your ladyships sudden new mood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it that you have the taste to renew the devilish sport which you played so successfully last year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you wish to see me once more a lovesick suppliant at your feet so that you might again have the pleasure of kicking me aside like a troublesome lapdog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had succeeded in rousing him for the moment and again she looked straight at him for it was thus she remembered him a year ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she whispered can we not bury the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pardon me madame but i understood you to say that your desire was to dwell in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said while a tone of tenderness crept into her voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rather did i speak of a time when you loved me still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you ever tried to get in as a chorus girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carrie began to feel that there was something exuberant and unnatural in his manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way most girls begin he went on who go on the stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was turning on her a glance of the companionable and persuasive manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a difficult thing he went on but theres always a chance you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as if he suddenly remembered he pulled out his watch and consulted it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive an appointment at two he said and ive got to go to lunch now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you care to come and dine with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no said carrie the whole motive of the man flashing on her at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats too bad he said realising that he had been a little beforehand in his offer and that carrie was about to go away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you she answered with some trepidation and went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the managers companion who had not caught all the details of the game he had played <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes in a way said the other sore to think the game had been lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this little experience nearly destroyed her ambition to call upon the manager at the chicago opera house but she decided to do so after a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was of a more sedate turn of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said at once that there was no opening of any sort and seemed to consider her search foolish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chicago is no place to get a start he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still she persisted and went to mcvickars where she could not find any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old homestead was running there but the person to whom she was referred was not to be found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these little expeditions took up her time until quite four oclock when she was weary enough to go home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt as if she ought to continue and inquire elsewhere but the results so far were too dispiriting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took the car and arrived at ogden place in threequarters of an hour but decided to ride on to the west side branch of the postoffice where she was accustomed to receive hurstwoods letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was one there now written saturday which she tore open and read with mingled feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was so much warmth in it and such tense complaint at her having failed to meet him and her subsequent silence that she rather pitied the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he had wished and dared to do so married as he was was the evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt as if the thing deserved an answer and consequently decided that she would write and let him know that she knew of his married state and was justly incensed at his deception <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would tell him that it was all over between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at her room the wording of this missive occupied her for some time for she fell to the task at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do not need to have me explain why i did not meet you she wrote in part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cannot expect me to have anything more to do with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have caused me more misery than you can think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you will get over your infatuation for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took the letter the next morning and at the corner dropped it reluctantly into the letterbox still uncertain as to whether she should do so or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she took the car and went down town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the dull season with the department stores but she was listened to with more consideration than was usually accorded to young women applicants owing to her neat and attractive appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was asked the same old questions with which she was already familiar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you ever worked in a retail store before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the fair see and companys and all the great stores it was much the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the dull season she might come in a little later possibly they would like to have her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she arrived at the house at the end of the day weary and disheartened she discovered that drouet had been there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought she missed other things but could not be sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently she would be facing the world in the same old way within a day or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put her two hands together in her customary expressive way and pressed her fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> large tears gathered in her eyes and broke hot across her cheeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drouet really had called but it was with a very different mind from that which carrie had imagined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he expected to find her to justify his return by claiming that he came to get the remaining portion of his wardrobe and before he got away again to patch up a peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> accordingly when he arrived he was disappointed to find carrie out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he trifled about hoping that she was somewhere in the neighbourhood and would soon return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he constantly listened expecting to hear her foot on the stair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he did so it was his intention to make believe that he had just come in and was disturbed at being caught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he would explain his need of his clothes and find out how things stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait as he did however carrie did not come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from pottering around among the drawers in momentary expectation of her arrival he changed to looking out of the window and from that to resting himself in the rockingchair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to grow restless and lit a cigar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he looked out of the window and saw clouds gathering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to think that it would be useless to wait and got hold of his umbrella and light coat intending to take these things any way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow he would come back for the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he started to go he felt truly sorry that he had missed her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a little picture of her on the wall showing her arrayed in the little jacket he had first bought herher face a little more wistful than he had seen it lately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was really touched by it and looked into the eyes of it with a rather rare feeling for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt do me right cad he said as if he were addressing her in the flesh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he went to the door took a good look around and went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was when he returned from his disturbed stroll about the streets after receiving the decisive note from mcgregor james and hay that hurstwood found the letter carrie had written him that morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thrilled intensely as he noted the handwriting and rapidly tore it open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he thought she loves me or she would not have written to me at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was slightly depressed at the tenor of the note for the first few minutes but soon recovered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wouldnt write at all if she didnt care for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was his one resource against the depression which held him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could extract little from the wording of the letter but the spirit he thought he knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was really something exceedingly humanif not patheticin his being thus relieved by a clearly worded reproof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he who had for so long remained satisfied with himself now looked outside of himself for comfortand to such a source <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the moment he forgot the letter from mcgregor james and hay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he could only have carrie perhaps he could get out of the whole entanglement perhaps it would not matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wouldnt care what his wife did with herself if only he might not lose carrie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood up and walked about dreaming his delightful dream of a life continued with this lovely possessor of his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not long however before the old worry was back for consideration and with it what weariness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought of the morrow and the suit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had done nothing and here was the afternoon slipping away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at five the attorneys would have gone home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even as he thought the last fifteen minutes passed away and it was five <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he abandoned the thought of seeing them any more that day and turned to carrie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is to be observed that the man did not justify himself to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his whole thought was the possibility of persuading carrie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he was thinking thus elatedly he remembered that he wanted some clean linen in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this he purchased together with a halfdozen ties and went to the palmer house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he entered he thought he saw drouet ascending the stairs with a key <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he thought perhaps they had changed their abode temporarily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think he is said the latter consulting his private registry list <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hurstwood turned away and set his lips so as best to express and conceal his feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hastened to his room with rising spirits and changed his linen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he did so he made up his mind that if carrie was alone or if she had gone to another place it behooved him to find out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill go to the door and ask if mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will bring out whether he is there or not and where carrie is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was almost moved to some muscular display as he thought of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on coming down from his room at six he looked carefully about to see if drouet was present and then went out to lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could scarcely eat however he was so anxious to be about his errand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before starting he thought it well to discover where drouet would be and returned to his hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no answered the latter hes in his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you wish to send up a card <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no ill call around later answered hurstwood and strolled out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took a madison car and went direct to ogden place this time walking boldly up to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is out of the city said the girl who had heard carrie tell this to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said hurstwood considerably taken back then as if burdened with something important you dont know to which theatre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl really had no idea where she had gone but not liking hurstwood and wishing to cause him trouble answered yes hooleys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you returned the manager and tipping his hat slightly went away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill look in at hooleys thought he but as a matter of fact he did not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before he had reached the central portion of the city he thought the whole matter over and decided it would be useless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as much as he longed to see carrie he knew she would be with some one and did not wish to intrude with his plea there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little later he might do soin the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only in the morning he had the lawyer question before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this little pilgrimage threw quite a wet blanket upon his rising spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was soon down again to his old worry and reached the resort anxious to find relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite a company of gentlemen were making the place lively with their conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a group of cook county politicians were conferring about a round cherrywood table in the rear portion of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several young merrymakers were chattering at the bar before making a belated visit to the theatre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a shabbilygenteel individual with a red nose and an old high hat was sipping a quiet glass of ale alone at one end of the bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hurstwood nodded to the politicians and went into his office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about ten oclock a friend of his mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taintor a local sport and racing man dropped in and seeing hurstwood alone in his office came to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said hurstwood somewhat relieved by the sight of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit down and he motioned him to one of the chairs in the little room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a slight cold the other day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while they were still conferring there several other of hurstwoods friends entered and not long after eleven the theatres being out some actors began to drop inamong them some notabilities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then began one of those pointless social conversations so common in american resorts where the wouldbe gilded attempt to rub off gilt from those who have it in abundance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if hurstwood had one leaning it was toward notabilities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he considered that if anywhere he belonged among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was too proud to toady too keen not to strictly observe the plane he occupied when there were those present who did not appreciate him but in situations like the present where he could shine as a gentleman and be received without equivocation as a friend and equal among men of known ability he was most delighted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on such occasions if ever that he would take something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the social flavour was strong enough he would even unbend to the extent of drinking glass for glass with his associates punctiliously observing his turn to pay as if he were an outsider like the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he ever approached intoxicationor rather that ruddy warmth and comfortableness which precedes the more sloven stateit was when individuals such as these were gathered about him when he was one of a circle of chatting celebrities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tonight disturbed as was his state he was rather relieved to find company and now that notabilities were gathered he laid aside his troubles for the nonce and joined in right heartily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not long before the imbibing began to tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stories began to crop upthose everenduring droll stories which form the major portion of the conversation among american men under such circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twelve oclock arrived the hour for closing and with it the company took leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had arrived at that state where his mind though clear was nevertheless warm in its fancies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt as if his troubles were not very serious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> going into his office he began to turn over certain accounts awaiting the departure of the bartenders and the cashier who soon left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the managers duty as well as his custom after all were gone to see that everything was safely closed up for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a rule no money except the cash taken in after banking hours was kept about the place and that was locked in the safe by the cashier who with the owners was joint keeper of the secret combination but nevertheless hurstwood nightly took the precaution to try the cash drawers and the safe in order to see that they were tightly closed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he would lock his own little office and set the proper light burning near the safe after which he would take his departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never in his experience had he found anything out of order but tonight after shutting down his desk he came out and tried the safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his way was to give a sharp pull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was slightly surprised at that and looking in found the money cases as left for the day apparently unprotected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his first thought was of course to inspect the drawers and shut the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill speak to mayhew about this tomorrow he thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter had certainly imagined upon going out a halfhour before that he had turned the knob on the door so as to spring the lock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had never failed to do so before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been revolving the problem of a business of his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took her by the arm and ran with her toward the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think he did not tell her what he thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got to find out what the devil has happened to fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him theres going to be a roughhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a shadow blacker than the night rose suddenly before them and a voice asked sternly but quietly what are you doing here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man lifted his arm clear of the girl and shoved her quickly from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his hand she felt the pressure of the revolver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he replied truculently and what are you doing here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am the night watchman answered the voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it struck miss forbes if the watchman knew that one of the trespassers was a woman he would be at once reassured and she we have lost our way she said pleasantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we came here she found herself staring blindly down a shaft of light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an instant the torch held her and then from her swept over the young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was no longer the same voice it was now savage and snarling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for answer the young man pressed the torch in his left hand and held in the two circles of light the men surveyed each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the newcomer was one of unusual bulk and height <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the collar of his overcoat hid his mouth and his derby hat was drawn down over his forehead but what they saw showed an intelligent strong face although for the moment it wore a menacing scowl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man dropped his revolver into his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my automobile ran dry he said we came in here to get some water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my chauffeur is back there somewhere with a couple of buckets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take your light out of my eyes returned the young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can see were notwe dont mean any harm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor have i so read or interpreted holy writ as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds then to be made is intended as a part of the retribution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that surely were a shallow view of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no these revelations unless i greatly err are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings who will stand waiting on that day to see the dark problem of this life made plain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a knowledge of mens hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i conceive moreover that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them up at that last day not with reluctance but with a joy unutterable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked roger chillingworth glancing quietly aside at the minister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterable solace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they mostly do said the clergyman griping hard at his breast as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me not only on the deathbed but while strong in life and fair in reputation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ever after such an outpouring oh what a relief have i witnessed in those sinful brethren <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even as in one who at last draws free air after a long stifling with his own polluted breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should a wretched manguilty we will say of murderprefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart rather than fling it forth at once and let the universe take care of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet some men bury their secrets thus observed the calm physician <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not to suggest more obvious reasons it may be that they are kept silent by the very constitution of their nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> orcan we not suppose it?guilty as they may be retaining nevertheless a zeal for gods glory and mans welfare they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of men because thenceforward no good can be achieved by them no evil of the past be redeemed by better service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so to their own unutterable torment they go about among their fellowcreatures looking pure as newfallen snow while their hearts are all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these men deceive themselves said roger chillingworth with somewhat more emphasis than usual and making a slight gesture with his forefinger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their love for man their zeal for gods servicethese holy impulses may or may not coexist in their hearts with the evil inmates to which their guilt has unbarred the door and which must needs propagate a hellish breed within them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if they seek to glorify god let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they would serve their fellowmen let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience in constraining them to penitential selfabasement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would thou have me to believe o wise and pious friend that a false show can be bettercan be more for gods glory or man welfarethan gods own truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be so said the young clergyman indifferently as waiving a discussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a ready faculty indeed of escaping from any topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperament.but now i would ask of my wellskilled physician whether in good sooth he deems me to have profited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before roger chillingworth could answer they heard the clear wild laughter of a young childs voice proceeding from the adjacent burialground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking instinctively from the open windowfor it was summertimethe minister beheld hester prynne and little pearl passing along the footpath that traversed the enclosure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pearl looked as beautiful as the day but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which whenever they occurred seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere of sympathy or human contact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she now skipped irreverently from one grave to another until coming to the broad flat armorial tombstone of a departed worthyperhaps of isaac johnson himselfshe began to dance upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in reply to her mothers command and entreaty that she would behave more decorously little pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking a handful of these she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom to which the burrs as their nature was tenaciously adhered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roger chillingworth had by this time approached the window and smiled grimly down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no law nor reverence for authority no regard for human ordinances or opinions right or wrong mixed up with that childs composition remarked he as much to himself as to his companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw her the other day bespatter the governor himself with water at the cattletrough in spring lane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none save the freedom of a broken law answered mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dimmesdale in a quiet way as if he had been discussing the point within himself whether capable of good i know not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the child probably overheard their voices for looking up to the window with a bright but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence she threw one of the prickly burrs at the rev <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sensitive clergyman shrank with nervous dread from the light missile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> detecting his emotion pearl clapped her little hands in the most extravagant ecstacy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hester prynne likewise had involuntarily looked up and all these four persons old and young regarded one another in silence till the child laughed aloud and shoutedcome away mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come away or yonder old black man will catch you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hath got hold of the minister already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come away mother or he will catch you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she drew her mother away skipping dancing and frisking fantastically among the hillocks of the dead people like a creature that had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation nor owned herself akin to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as if she had been made afresh out of new elements and must perforce be permitted to live her own life and be a law unto herself without her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there goes a woman resumed roger chillingworth after a pause who be her demerits what they may hath none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is hester prynne the less miserable think you for that scarlet letter on her breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do verily believe it answered the clergyman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a look of pain in her face which i would gladly have been spared the sight of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still methinks it must needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain as this poor woman hester is than to cover it up in his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was another pause and the physician began anew to examine and arrange the plants which he had gathered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you inquired of me a little time agone said he at length my judgment as touching your health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did answered the clergyman and would gladly learn it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speak frankly i pray you be it for life or death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freely then and plainly said the physician still busy with his plants but keeping a wary eye on mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dimmesdale the disorder is a strange one not so much in itself nor as outwardly manifestedin so far at least as the symptoms have been laid open to my observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking daily at you my good sir and watching the tokens of your aspect now for months gone by i should deem you a man sore sick it may be yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician might well hope to cure you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i know not what to say the disease is what i seem to know yet know it not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you speak in riddles learned sir said the pale minister glancing aside out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then to speak more plainly continued the physician and i crave pardon sir should it seem to require pardon for this needful plainness of my speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old french officer delivered this with an air of such candour and good sense as coincided with my first favourable impressions of his character i thought i loved the man but i fear i mistook the object twas my own way of thinking the difference was i could not have expressed it half so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is alike troublesome to both the rider and his beast if the latter goes pricking up his ears and starting all the way at every object which he never saw before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have as little torment of this kind as any creature alive and yet i honestly confess that many a thing gave me pain and that i blushd at many a word the first month which i found inconsequent and perfectly innocent the second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame do rambouliet after an acquaintance of about six weeks with her had done me the honour to take me in her coach about two leagues out of town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all women madame de rambouliet is the most correct and i never wish to see one of more virtues and purity of heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in our return back madame de rambouliet desired me to pull the cord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked her if she wanted anything rien que pour pisser said madame de rambouliet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grieve not gentle traveller to let madame de rambouliet pss on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go each one pluck your rose and scatter them in your path for madame de rambouliet did no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i handed madame de rambouliet out of the coach and had i been the priest of the chaste castalia i could not have served at her fountain with a more respectful decorum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the old french officer had delivered upon travelling bringing poloniuss advice to his son upon the same subject into my head and that bringing in hamlet and hamlet the rest of shakespeares works i stoppd at the quai de conti in my return home to purchase the whole set <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bookseller said he had not a set in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i taking one up out of a set which lay upon the counter betwixt us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said they were sent him only to be got bound and were to be sent back to versailles in the morning to the count de b <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and does the count de b said i read shakespeare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what is more to his honour monsieur he loves the english too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you speak this so civilly said i that it is enough to oblige an englishman to lay out a louis dor or two at your shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bookseller made a bow and was going to say something when a young decent girl about twenty who by her air and dress seemed to be fille de chambre to some devout woman of fashion come into the shop and asked for les egarements du coeur et de lesprit the bookseller gave her the book directly she pulled out a little green satin purse run round with a riband of the same colour and putting her finger and thumb into it she took out the money and paid for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i had nothing more to stay me in the shop we both walkd out at the door together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what have you to do my dear said i with the wanderings of the heart who scarce know yet you have one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor till love has first told you it or some faithless shepherd has made it ache canst thou ever be sure it is so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with reason said i for if it is a good one tis pity it should be stolen tis a little treasure to thee and gives a better air to your face than if it was dressd out with pearls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young girl listened with a submissive attention holding her satin purse by its riband in her hand all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis a very small one said i taking hold of the bottom of it she held it towards me and there is very little in it my dear said i but be but as good as thou art handsome and heaven will fill it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a parcel of crowns in my hand to pay for shakespeare and as she had let go the purse entirely i put a single one in and tying up the riband in a bowknot returned it to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this woman of whom h writeswhoever she beor any one in short but your ow dear self mama and edward may have been so barbarou to bely me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond you three is there a creature in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evi than willoughby whose heart i know so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elinor would not contend and only replied whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let the be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your ow innocence and good intentions supports your spirits it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resist such malevolence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no cried marianne misery such as mine ha no pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i care not who knows that i am wretched the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elinor elinor they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they likemay resist insult or return mortificationbut i cannot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must feeli must be wretchedand they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would do more than for my own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to appea happy when i am so miserableoh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elinor was employe in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window from the window to the fire without knowing that sh received warmth from one or discerning objects throug the other and marianne seated at the foot of the bed with her head leaning against one of its posts again took up willoughbys letter and after shudderin it is too much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever he might have heard against me ought he not to have suspended his belief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ought he not t have told me of it to have given me the power of clearin myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lock of hair repeating it from the letter which you so obligingly bestowed on methat is unpardonable willoughby where was your heart when you wrote those words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet this womanwho knows what her art ma have been?how long it may have been premeditated and how deeply contrived by her!who is she?who ca she be?whom did i ever hear him talk of as young an attractive among his female acquaintance?oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one no onehe talked to me only of myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another pause ensued marianne was greatly agitated elinor i must go home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must go and comfort mama can not we be gone tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came only fo willoughbys sakeand now who cares for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings much more than civility and civility o the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then another day or two perhaps but i canno stay here long i cannot stay to endure the question and remarks of all these people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the middletons an palmershow am i to bear their pity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pity of suc a woman as lady middleton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elinor advised her to lie down again and for moment she did so but no attitude could give her ease and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from on posture to another till growing more and more hysterical her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all and for some time was fearful of being constrained to cal for assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some lavender drops however which sh was at length persuaded to take were of use and fro that time till mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings came immediately to their room on her return and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered how do you do my dear?said she in a voice of great compassion to marianne who turned away her face without how is she miss dashwood?poor thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is to be marrie very soona goodfornothing fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taylor told me of it half an hour ago and she was told it by a particular friend of mis grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it and i was almost ready to sink as it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i all i can say is that if this be true he has use a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill and wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out and so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it i have no notion of mens going on in this way and if eve i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as h has not had this many a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there is one comfort my dear miss marianne he is not the only young ma in the world worth having and with your pretty fac you will never want admirers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i won disturb her any longer for she had better have her cr out at once and have done with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the parrys and sanderson luckily are coming tonight you know and that will amuse her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then went away walking on tiptoe out of the room as if she supposed her young friends affliction coul marianne to the surprise of her sister determined on dining with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no she would go down she coul bear it very well and the bustle about her woul be less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elinor pleased to have her governed for moment by such a motive though believing it hardl possible that she could sit out the dinner said no more and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could while marianne still remained on the bed was read to assist her into the dining room as soon as they wer when there though looking most wretchedly she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected had she tried to speak or had she been conscious of hal mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jenningss wellmeant but illjudged attention to her this calmness could not have been maintained but not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstractio of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thin elinor who did justice to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jenningss kindness though its effusions were often distressing and sometime almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments and returned her those civilities which her sister coul not make or return for herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their good friend sa that marianne was unhappy and felt that every thin was due to her which might make her at all less so she treated her therefore with all the indulgent fondnes of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day o its holidays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marianne was to have the best place by the fire was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day had not elinor in the sad countenance of her sister seen a check to all mirth she could have been entertaine by mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jenningss endeavours to cure a disappointment in love by a variety of sweetmeats and olives and a good fire as soon however as the consciousness of all this wa forced by continual repetition on marianne she coul stay no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a hasty exclamation of misery and a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly go poor soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings as soon as she was gone how it grieves me to see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i declare if she i not gone away without finishing her wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing seems to do her any good i am sure if i knew of any thing she would like i woul send all over the town for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it is the oddes thing to me that a man should use such a pretty gir so ill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other lord bless you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they car the lady thenmiss grey i think you called her is very rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome i remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe she marrie a very wealthy man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the family are all rich together fifty thousand pounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by all accounts it wont com before its wanted for they say he is all to pieces no wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dashing about with his curricle and hunters well it dont signify talking but when a young man be who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to fly of from his word only because he grows poor and a riche girl is ready to have him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont he in such a case sell his horses let his house turn off his servants and make a thorough reform at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i warrant you miss marianne would have been ready to wait till matter came round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that wont do nowadays nothing in th way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men o this age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never heard any harm of her indeed i hardly eve heard her mentioned except that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taylor did sa this morning that one day miss walker hinted to her that she believed mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ellison would not be sorr to have miss grey married for she and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now she is of ag and may choose for herself and a pretty choice she ha made!what now after pausing a momentyour poor siste is gone to her own room i suppose to moan by herself is there nothing one can get to comfort her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor dear it seems quite cruel to let her be alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well byandby w shall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little what shall we play at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hates whist i know but is ther no round game she cares for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear maam this kindness is quite unnecessary marianne i dare say will not leave her room agai this evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall persuade her if i can to g early to bed for i am sure she wants rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aye i believe that will be best for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let her nam her own supper and go to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder she ha been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so the letter that came today finished it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure if i had had a notion of it i would not have joked her about it for all my money but then you know how should i guess such a thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter and you know young people like to be laughed at about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when the hear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had my senses about me i might have calle in conduit street in my way home and told them of it but i shall see them tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be unnecessary i am sure for you to cautio mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> palmer and sir john against ever naming mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> willoughby or making the slightest allusion to what has passed before my sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their own goodnature must point ou to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thin about it when she is present and the less that may eve be said to myself on the subject the more my feeling will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be terribl for you to hear it talked of and as for your sister i am sure i would not mention a word about it to he for the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you saw i did not all dinner time no more would sir john nor my daughters for they ar all very thoughtful and considerate especially if give them a hint as i certainly will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my part i think the less that is said about such things the better the sooner tis blown over and forgot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what doe talking ever do you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctors round full face framed in a lightcoloured whisker was th perfection of a dignified amenity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the onl human being in the world who seemed to take th slightest interest in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would generally sit i i suppose the only thing now is to take care o them as you are doing till i can get the ship t sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he inclined his head shutting his eyes under th the sea undoubtedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first member of the crew fairly knocked ove was the stewardthe first man to whom i ha spoken on board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was taken ashore wit choleric symptoms and died there at the end of week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then while i was still under the startlin impression of this first homethrust of the climate mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns gave up and went to bed in a ragin i believe he had partly fretted himself into tha illness the climate did the rest with the swiftnes of an invisible monster ambushed in the air in th water in the mud of the riverbank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burn i discovered him lying on his back glaring sul lenly and radiating heat on one like a small furnace he would hardly answer my questions and onl grumbled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> couldnt a man take an afternoon of that evening as i sat in the saloon after dinner i could hear him muttering continuously in hi room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ransome who was clearing the table sai i am afraid sir i wont be able to give the mat all the attention hes likely to need <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will hav to be forward in the galley a great part of m time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mate had pointe him out to me the first day standing on the deck his arms crossed on his broad chest gazing on th even at a distance his wellproportioned figure something thoroughly sailorlike in his poise mad him noticeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on nearer view the intelligent quiet eyes a wellbred face the disciplined in dependence of his manner made up an attractiv personality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns tol me that he was the best seaman in the ship i ex pressed my surprise that in his earliest prime and o such appearance he should sign on as cook on boar its his heart mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he mustnt exert him self too much or he may drop dead suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he was the only one the climate had no touchedperhaps because carrying a deadl enemy in his breast he had schooled himself into systematic control of feelings and movements when one was in the secret this was apparent in hi manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the poor steward died and as h could not be replaced by a white man in thi oriental port ransome had volunteered to do th i can do it all right sir as long as i go about i but obviously he couldnt be expected to take u sicknursing in addition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover the docto with a seaman on each side holding him u under the arms the mate went over the gangwa more sullen than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we built him up with pil lows in the gharry and he made an effort to sa nowyouve gotwhat you wantedgot m out ofthe ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were never more mistaken in your life mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns i said quietly duly smiling at him and the trap drove off to a sort of sanatorium pavilion of bricks which the doctor had in th i visited mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the firs few days when he didnt know anybody he re ceived me as if i had come either to gloat over a enemy or else to curry favour with a deepl wronged person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she merely looked from her mother to her father with a grieved face for their protection and lapham said when weve done supper you answer her persis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> demanded her father with a mouth full of ham <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham gave himself time to swallow his morsel and his rising wrath went down with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess youll change your mind when the time comes he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyway persis you say well all come and then if penelope dont want to go you can excuse her after we get there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of them apparently saw any reason why the affair should not be left in this way or had a sense of the awful and binding nature of a dinner engagement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she believed that penelope would not finally change her mind and go no doubt mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not find it so simple a matter to accept the invitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham had her doubts whether it would not be a servile imitation to say dear mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> corey in return and she was tormented as to the proper phrasing throughout and the precise temperature which she should impart to her politeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wrote an unpractised uncharacteristic round hand the same in which she used to set the childrens copies at school and she subscribed herself after some hesitation between her husbands given name and her own yours truly mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> penelope had gone to her room without waiting to be asked to advise or criticise but irene had decided upon the paper and on the whole mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laphams note when the furnaceman came the colonel sent him out to post it in the box at the corner of the square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had determined not to say anything more about the matter before the girls not choosing to let them see that he was elated he tried to give the effect of its being an everyday sort of thing abruptly closing the discussion with his order to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham to accept but he had remained swelling behind his newspaper during her prolonged struggle with her note and he could no longer well pers he demanded what do you say now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham had been sobered into something of her former misgiving by her difficulties with her note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i declare im all mixed up about it and i dont know as weve begun as we can carry out in promising to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i presume she sighed that we can all send some excuse at the last moment if we dont want to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess we can carry out and i guess we shant want to send any excuse bragged the colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if were ever going to be anybody at all weve got to go and see how its done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i presume weve got to give some sort of party when we get into the new house and this gives the chance to ask em back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant complain now but what theyve made the advances persis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham lifelessly i wonder why they wanted to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i suppose its all right she added in deprecation of the anger with her humility which she saw rising in her husbands face but if its all going to be as much trouble as that letter id rather be whipped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what im going to wear or the girls either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do wonderive heard that people go to dinner in lownecks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you just go round to whites or jordan marshs and ask for a dinner dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see em in the window every time i pass lots of em oh it aint the dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont suppose but what we could get along with that and i want to do the best we can for the children but i dont know what were going to talk about to those people when we get there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we havent got anything in common with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i dont say theyre any better she again made haste to say in arrest of her husbands resentment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe they are and i dont see why they should be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there aint anybody has got a better right to hold up their head than you have silas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got plenty of money and youve made every cent of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess i shouldnt amounted to much without you persis oh dont talk about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that youve made it all right about rogers there aint a thing in this world against you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still for all that i can seeand i can feel it when i cant see itthat were different from those people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre wellmeaning enough and theyd excuse it i presume but were too old to learn to be like them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no the children aint admitted his wife and thats the only thing that reconciles me to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see how pleased irene looked when i read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i guess penelopell think better of it before the time comes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but whether were doing the best thing for em goodness knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irenell be a lucky girl to get him if she wants him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id ten times rather she was going to marry such a fellow as you were si that had to make every inch of his own way and she had to help him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham laughed aloud for pleasure in his wifes fondness but neither of them wished that he should respond directly to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess if it want for me he wouldnt have a much easier time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that dinner aint a thing for you to be uneasy about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham did not keep his courageous mind quite to the end of the week that followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was his theory not to let corey see that he was set up about the invitation and when the young man said politely that his mother was glad they were able to come lapham was very short with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterward he was afraid corey might not understand that he was coming too but he did not know how to approach the subject again and corey did not so he let it pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it worried him to see all the preparation that his wife and irene were making and he tried to laugh at them for it and it worried him to find that penelope was making no preparation at all for herself but only helping the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked her what should she do if she changed her mind at the last moment and concluded to go and she said she guessed she should not change her mind but if she did she would go to whites with him and get him to choose her an imported dress he seemed to like them so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally all that dressmaking in the house began to scare him with vague apprehensions in regard to his own dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as he had determined to go an ideal of the figure in which he should go presented itself to his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he should not wear any dresscoat because for one thing he considered that a man looked like a fool in a dresscoat and for another thing he had nonehad none on principle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would go in a frockcoat and black pantaloons and perhaps a white waistcoat but a black cravat anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as soon as he developed this ideal to his family which he did in pompous disdain of their anxieties about their own dress they said he should not go so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> irene reminded him that he was the only person without a dresscoat at a corps reunion dinner which he had taken her to some years before and she remembered feeling awfully about it at the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham who would perhaps have agreed of herself shook her head with misgiving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see but what youll have to get you one si she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe they ever go without em to a private house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held out openly but on his way home the next day in a sudden panic he cast anchor before his tailors door and got measured for a dresscoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that he began to he afflicted about his waistcoat concerning which he had hitherto been airily indifferent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to get opinion out of his family but they were not so clear about it as they were about the frock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it ended in their buying a book of etiquette which settled the question adversely to a white waistcoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the author however after being very explicit in telling them not to eat with their knives and above all not to pick their teeth with their forksa thing which he said no lady or gentleman ever didwas still far from decided as to the kind of cravat colonel lapham ought to wear shaken on other points lapham had begun to waver also concerning the black cravat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to the question of gloves for the colonel which suddenly flashed upon him one evening it appeared never to have entered the thoughts of the etiquette man as lapham called him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other authors on the same subject were equally silent and irene could only remember having heard in some vague sort of way that gentlemen did not wear gloves so much drops of perspiration gathered on laphams forehead in the anxiety of the debate he groaned and he swore i declare said penelope where she sat purblindly sewing on a bit of dress for irene the colonels clothes are as much trouble as anybodys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont you go to jordan marshs and order one of the imported dresses for yourself father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that gave them all the he had an awful longing to find out from corey how he ought to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he formulated and repeated over to himself an apparently careless question such as oh by the way corey where do you get your gloves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this would naturally lead to some talk on the subject which would if properly managed clear up the whole trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lapham found that he would rather die than ask this question or any question that would bring up the dinner again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> corey did not recur to it and lapham avoided the matter with positive fierceness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shunned talking with corey one night before they fell asleep his wife said to him i was reading in one of those books today and i dont believe but what weve made a mistake if pen holds out that she wont go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> demanded lapham in the dismay which beset him the book says that its very impolite not to answer a dinner invitation promptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well weve done that all rightat first i didnt know but what we had been a little too quick may bebut then it says if youre not going that its the height of rudeness not to let them know at once so that they can fill your place at the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well im dumned he said finally if there seems to be any end to this thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it was to do over again id say no for all of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive wished a hundred times they hadnt asked us but its too late to think about that now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the question is what are we going to do about penelope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i guess shell go at the last moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> corey that day and she cant seem to get over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then hadnt you better write in the morning as soon as youre up that she aint coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt know how to get it in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its so late now i dont see how i could have the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then shes got to go thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and im set she shall said lapham with the loud obstinacy of a man whose women always have their way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham was not supported by the sturdiness but she did not know how to do what she knew she ought to do about penelope and she let matters drift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all the child had a right to stay at home if she did not wish to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lapham felt and what she said to her husband next morning bidding him let penelope alone unless she chose herself to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said it was too late now to do anything and she must make the best excuse she could when she saw mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she began to wish that irene and her father would go and excuse her too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could not help saying this and then look here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who wanted to go in for these people in the first place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt you come home full of em last year and want me to sell out here and move somewheres else because it didnt seem to suit em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now you want to put it all on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt put it on you as you say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever since that fellow happened to come into the new house that day youve been perfectly crazy to get in with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now youre so afraid you shall do something wrong before em you dont hardly dare to say your lifes your own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i declare if you pester me any more about those gloves silas lapham i wont go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you suppose i want to go on my own account <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know very well that youre doing it for irene but for goodness gracious sake dont worry our lives out and make yourself a perfect laughingstock before the children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before us over the margin of the dump we could see the sun still striking aslant into the wooded nick below and on the battlemented pine bescattered ridges on the farther side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no stove of course and no hearth in our lodging so we betook ourselves to the blacksmiths forge across the platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the platform be taken as a stage and the out curving margin of the dump to represent the line of the foot lights then our house would be the first wing on the actors left and this blacksmiths forge although no match for it in size the foremost on the right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a low brown cottage planted close against the hill and overhung by the foliage and peeling boughs of a madrona thicket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within it was full of dead leaves and mountain dust and rubbish from the mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we soon had a good fire brightly blazing and sat close about it on impromptu seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chuchu the slave of sofacushions whimpered for a softer bed but the rest of us were greatly revived and comforted by that good creature fire which gives us warmth and light and companionable sounds and colours up the emptiest building with better than frescoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a while it was even pleasant in the forge with the blaze in the midst and a look over our shoulders on the woods and mountains where the day was dying like a dolphin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was between seven and eight before hanson arrived with a waggonful of our effects and two of his wifes relatives to lend him a hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would pick up a huge packingcase full of books of all things swing it on his shoulder and away up the two crazy ladders and the breakneck spout of rolling mineral familiarly termed a path that led from the carttrack to our house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even for a man unburthened the ascent was toilsome and precarious but irvine sealed it with a light foot carrying box after box as the hero whisks the stage child up the practicable footway beside the waterfall of the fifth act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with so strong a helper the business was speedily transacted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon the assayers office was thronged with our belongings piled higgledypiggledy and upside down about the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were our boxes indeed but my wife had left her keys in calistoga <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our carriers had forgot the chimney and lost one of the plates along the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rufe himself was grave and goodnatured over his share of blame he even if i remember right expressed regret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his crew to my astonishment and anger grinned from ear to ear and laughed aloud at our distress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they thought it real funny about the stovepipe they had forgotten real funny that they should have lost a plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for hay the whole party refused to bring us any till they should have supped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had there been such a job as coming up that grade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor often i suspect such a game of poker as that before they started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but about nine as a particular favour we should have some hay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they took their departure leaving me still staring and we resigned ourselves to wait for their return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lake had formerly borne the name of truth lake but from this time on was called wicasabdeman lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a deep forest far from the villages of his people lived a hermit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tent was made of buffalo skins and his dress was made of deer skin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far from the haunts of any human being this old hermit was content to spend his days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all day long he would wander through the forest studying the different plants of nature and collecting precious roots which he used as medicine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at long intervals some warrior would arrive at the tent of the old hermit and get medicine roots from him for the tribe the old hermits medicine being considered far superior to all others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a long days ramble in the woods the hermit came home late and being very tired at once lay down on his bed and was just dozing off to sleep when he felt something rub against his foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> awakening with a start he noticed a dark object and an arm was extended to him holding in its hand a flint pointed arrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hermit thought this must be a spirit as there is no human being around here but myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a voice then said hermit i have come to invite you to my home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how yes i will come said the old hermit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherewith he arose wrapped his robe about him and followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> outside the door he stopped and looked around but could see no signs of the dark object <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whoever you are or whatever you be wait for me as i dont know where to go to find your house said the hermit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not an answer did he receive nor could he hear any noises as though anyone was walking through the brush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reentering his tent he retired and was soon fast asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next night the same thing occurred again and the hermit followed the object out only to be left as before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very angry to think that anyone should be trying to make sport of him and he determined to find out who this could be who was disturbing his nights rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next evening he cut a hole in the tent large enough to stick an arrow through and stood by the door watching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon the dark object came and stopped outside of the door and said grandfather i came to but he never finished the sentence for the old man let go his arrow and he heard the arrow strike something which produced a sound as though he had shot into a sack of pebbles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not go out that night to see what his arrow had struck but early next morning he went out and looked at the spot about where he thought the object had stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there on the ground lay a little heap of corn and from this little heap a small line of corn lay scattered along a path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he came to a very small knoll the trail ended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of the trail was a large circle from which the grass had been scraped off clean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the corn trail stops at the edge of this circle said the old man so this must be the home of whoever it was that invited me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took his bone knife and hatchet and proceeded to dig down into the center of the circle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had got down to the length of his arm he came to a sack of dried meat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next he found a sack of indian turnips then a sack of dried cherries then a sack of corn and last of all another sack empty except that there was about a cupful of corn in one corner of it and that the sack had a hole in the other corner where his arrow had pierced it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from this hole in the sack the corn was scattered along the trail which from this the hermit taught the tribes how to keep their provisions when traveling and were overloaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he explained to them how they should dig a pit and put their provisions into it and cover them with earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this method the indians used to keep provisions all summer and when fall came they would return to their cache and on opening it would find everything as fresh as the day they were placed there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old hermit was also thanked as the discoverer of corn which had never been known to the indians until discovered by the old hermit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his curiosity incited him to range from place to place and try all the varieties of conversation his elegance of address and fertility of ideas gained him friends wherever he appeared or at least he found the general kindness of reception always shown to a young man whose birth and fortune give him a claim to notice and who has neither by vice nor folly destroyed his privileges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aliger was pleased with this general smile of mankind and was industrious to preserve it by compliance and officiousness but did not suffer his desire of pleasing to vitiate his integrity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was his established maxim that a promise is never to be broken nor was it without long reluctance that he once suffered himself to be drawn away from a festal engagement by the importunity of another company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spent the evening as is usual in the rudiments of vice in perturbation and imperfect enjoyment and met his disappointed friends in the morning with confusion and excuses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his companions not accustomed to such scrupulous anxiety laughed at his uneasiness compounded the offence for a bottle gave him courage to break his word again and again levied the penalty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ventured the same experiment upon another society and found them equally ready to consider it as a venial fault always incident to a man of quickness and gaiety till by degrees he began to think himself at liberty to follow the last invitation and was no longer shocked at the turpitude of falsehood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made no difficulty to promise his presence at distant places and if listlessness happened to creep upon him he would sit at home with great tranquillity and has often sunk to sleep in a chair while he held ten tables in continual expectations of his entrance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so pleasant to live in perpetual vacancy that he soon dismissed his attention as an useless incumbrance and resigned himself to carelessness and dissipation without any regard to the future or the past or any other motive of action than the impulse of a sudden desire or the attraction of immediate pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the absent were immediately forgotten and the hopes or fears felt by others had no influence upon his conduct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was in speculation completely just but never kept his promise to a creditor he was benevolent but always deceived those friends whom he undertook to patronise or assist he was prudent but suffered his affairs to be embarrassed for want of regulating his accounts at stated times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he courted a young lady and when the settlements were drawn took a ramble into the country on the day appointed to sign them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolved to travel and sent his chests on shipboard but delayed to follow them till he lost his passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was summoned as an evidence in a cause of great importance and loitered on the way till the trial was past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is said that when he had with great expense formed an interest in a borough his opponent contrived by some agents who knew his temper to lure him away on the day of election <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his benevolence draws him into the commission of a thousand crimes which others less kind or civil would escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his courtesy invites application his promises produce dependance he has his pockets filled with petitions which he intends some time to deliver and enforce and his table covered with letters of request with which he purposes to comply but time slips imperceptibly away while he is either idle or busy his friends lose their opportunities and charge upon him their miscarriages and calamities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this character however contemptible is not peculiar to aliger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they whose activity of imagination is often shifting the scenes of expectation are frequently subject to such sallies of caprice as make all their actions fortuitous destroy the value of their friendship obstruct the efficacy of their virtues and set them below the meanest of those that persist in their resolutions execute what they design and perform what they have promised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gr prooes apanta deilooes o penhs pragmata gr kaioe pantas auoetou <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the recital of these and many other moving perils of the like nature constantly harrows up the feelings of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nixon has a tolerably extensive circle of female acquaintance being a goodhumoured talkative bustling little body and to the unmarried girls among them she is constantly vaunting the virtues of her son hinting that she will be a very happy person who wins him but that they must mind their ps and qs for he is very particular and terribly severe upon young ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this last caution the young ladies resident in the same row who happen to be spending the evening there put their pockethandkerchiefs before their mouths and are troubled with a short cough just then felix knocks at the door and his mother drawing the teatable nearer the fire calls out to him as he takes off his boots in the back parlour that he neednt mind coming in in his slippers for there are only the two miss greys and miss thompson and she is quite sure they will excuse him and nodding to the two miss greys she adds in a whisper that julia thompson is a great favourite with felix at which intelligence the short cough comes again and miss thompson in particular is greatly troubled with it till felix coming in very faint for want of his tea changes the subject of discourse and enables her to laugh out boldly and tell amelia grey not to be so foolish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not know all even about sisters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because in all that she knew or remembered or wondered about there was nothing at all about that strange thing that all the little another strange thing came into her mind brought into her mind partly by her ears but mostly by her eyes there were not in this new world on the high mountainperhaps there were not after all so many anywhere as she had thoughtthere were not so many sisters like sister helen vincula for was not sister helen vincula the only sister she had seen on the mountain? <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were not after all so many sisters like sister angela and sister mary felice who watched the little bluecheckedapron girls playing in the sand and sister ignatius who cooked the cakes with the caraway seeds in them and sister theckla who taught the little girls to count and to sing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the whole world surely the uponthe mountainworld seemed full of onlyjustladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt convinced as she opened her box that this must be her aunt osgoods opinion for miss nancys mind resembled her aunts to a degree that everybody said was surprising considering the kinship was on mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> osgoods side and though you might not have supposed it from the formality of their greeting there was a devoted attachment and mutual admiration between aunt and niece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even miss nancys refusal of her cousin gilbert osgood on the ground solely that he was her cousin though it had grieved her aunt greatly had not in the least cooled the preference which had determined her to leave nancy several of her hereditary ornaments let gilberts future wife be whom she might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three of the ladies quickly retired but the miss gunns were quite content that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> osgoods inclination to remain with her niece gave them also a reason for staying to see the rustic beautys toilette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was really a pleasurefrom the first opening of the bandbox where everything smelt of lavender and roseleaves to the clasping of the small coral necklace that fitted closely round her little white neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything belonging to miss nancy was of delicate purity and nattiness not a crease was where it had no business to be not a bit of her linen professed whiteness without fulfilling its profession the very pins on her pincushion were stuck in after a pattern from which she was careful to allow no aberration and as for her own person it gave the same idea of perfect unvarying neatness as the body of a little bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true that her lightbrown hair was cropped behind like a boys and was dressed in front in a number of flat rings that lay quite away from her face but there was no sort of coiffure that could make miss nancys cheek and neck look otherwise than pretty and when at last she stood complete in her silvery twilled silk her lace tucker her coral necklace and coral eardrops the miss gunns could see nothing to criticise except her hands which bore the traces of buttermaking cheesecrushing and even still coarser work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but miss nancy was not ashamed of that for even while she was dressing she narrated to her aunt how she and priscilla had packed their boxes yesterday because this morning was baking morning and since they were leaving home it was desirable to make a good supply of meatpies for the kitchen and as she concluded this judicious remark she turned to the miss gunns that she might not commit the rudeness of not including them in the conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the miss gunns smiled stiffly and thought what a pity it was that these rich country people who could afford to buy such good clothes really miss nancys lace and silk were very costly should be brought up in utter ignorance and vulgarity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she actually said mate for meat appen for perhaps and oss for horse which to young ladies living in good lytherly society who habitually said orse even in domestic privacy and only said appen on the right occasions was necessarily shocking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss nancy indeed had never been to any school higher than dame tedmans her acquaintance with profane literature hardly went beyond the rhymes she had worked in her large sampler under the lamb and the shepherdess and in order to balance an account she was obliged to effect her subtraction by removing visible metallic shillings and sixpences from a visible metallic total <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is hardly a servantmaid in these days who is not better informed than miss nancy yet she had the essential attributes of a ladyhigh veracity delicate honour in her dealings deference to others and refined personal habitsand lest these should not suffice to convince grammatical fair ones that her feelings can at all resemble theirs i will add that she was slightly proud and exacting and as constant in her affection towards a baseless opinion as towards an erring lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the anxiety about sister priscilla which had grown rather active by the time the coral necklace was clasped was happily ended by the entrance of that cheerfullooking lady herself with a face made blowsy by cold and damp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the first questions and greetings she turned to nancy and surveyed her from head to footthen wheeled her round to ascertain that the back view was equally faultless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think o these gowns aunt osgood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said priscilla while nancy helped her to unrobe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im obliged to have the same as nancy you know for all im five years older and it makes me look yallow for she never will have anything without i have mine just like it because she wants us to look like sisters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i tell her folks ull think its my weakness makes me fancy as i shall look pretty in what she looks pretty in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i am uglytheres no denying that i feature my fathers family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> priscilla here turned to the miss gunns rattling on in too much preoccupation with the delight of talking to notice that her candour was not appreciated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pretty uns do for flycatchersthey keep the men off us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive no opinion o the men miss gunni dont know what you have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as for fretting and stewing about what theyll think of you from morning till night and making your life uneasy about what theyre doing when theyre out o your sightas i tell nancy its a folly no woman need be guilty of if shes got a good father and a good home let her leave it to them as have got no fortin and cant help themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> haveyourownway is the best husband and the only one id ever promise to obey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know it isnt pleasant when youve been used to living in a big way and managing hogsheads and all that to go and put your nose in by somebody elses fireside or to sit down by yourself to a scrag or a knuckle but thank god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my fathers a sober man and likely to live and if youve got a man by the chimneycorner it doesnt matter if hes childishthe business neednt be broke up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the delicate process of getting her narrow gown over her head without injury to her smooth curls obliged miss priscilla to pause in this rapid survey of life and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> osgood seized the opportunity well niece youll follow us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the miss gunns will like to go down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sister said nancy when they were alone youve offended the miss gunns im sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why you asked them if they minded about being uglyyoure so very blunt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it popped out its a mercy i said no more for im a bad un to live with folks when they dont like the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as for being ugly look at me child in this silvercoloured silk i told you how it ud bei look as yallow as a daffadil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anybody ud say you wanted to make a mawkin of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brandy possessed this man like an evil spirit and made him as surly and savage as a wild beast and as miserable as a lost soul but there was supposed to be in him such wonderful skill such native gifts of healing beyond any which medical science could impart that society caught hold of him and would not let him sink out of its reach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so swaying to and fro upon his horse and grumbling thick accents at the bedside he visited all the sickchambers for miles about among the mountain towns and sometimes raised a dying man as it were by miracle or quite as often no doubt sent his patient to a grave that was dug many a year too soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor had an everlasting pipe in his mouth and as somebody said in allusion to his habit of swearing it was always alight with hellfire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these three worthies pressed forward and greeted ethan brand each after his own fashion earnestly inviting him to partake of the contents of a certain black bottle in which as they averred he would find something far better worth seeking than the unpardonable sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no mind which has wrought itself by intense and solitary meditation into a high state of enthusiasm can endure the kind of contact with low and vulgar modes of thought and feeling to which ethan brand was now subjected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made him doubtand strange to say it was a painful doubtwhether he had indeed found the unpardonable sin and found it within himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole question on which he had exhausted life and more than life looked like a delusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leave me he said bitterly ye brute beasts that have made yourselves so shrivelling up your souls with fiery liquors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> years and years ago i groped into your hearts and found nothing there for my purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why you uncivil scoundrel cried the fierce doctor is that the way you respond to the kindness of your best friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have no more found the unpardonable sin than yonder boy joe has <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are but a crazy fellowi told you so twenty years agoneither better nor worse than a crazy fellow and the fit companion of old humphrey here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pointed to an old man shabbily dressed with long white hair thin visage and unsteady eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some years past this aged person had been wandering about among the hills inquiring of all travellers whom he met for his daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl it seemed had gone off with a company of circusperformers and occasionally tidings of her came to the village and fine stories were told of her glittering appearance as she rode on horseback in the ring or performed marvellous feats on the tightrope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whitehaired father now approached ethan brand and gazed unsteadily into his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they tell me you have been all over the earth said he wringing his hands with earnestness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have seen my daughter for she makes a grand figure in the world and everybody goes to see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did she send any word to her old father or say when she was coming back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ethan brands eye quailed beneath the old mans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that daughter from whom he so earnestly desired a word of greeting was the esther of our tale the very girl whom with such cold and remorseless purpose ethan brand had made the subject of a psychological experiment and wasted absorbed and perhaps annihilated her soul in the process <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he murmured turning away from the hoary wanderer it is no delusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miranda had not had perhaps quite as many opportunities in which to lose her temper but it is only just to say that she had not fully availed herself of all that had offered themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had been one outburst of righteous wrath occasioned by rebeccas overhospitable habits which were later shown in a still more dramatic and unexpected fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a certain friday afternoon she asked her aunt miranda if she might take half her bread and milk upstairs to a friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what friend have you got up there for pitys sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the simpson baby come to stay over sunday that is if youre willing mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall i bring her down and show her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes dressed in an old dress of emma janes and she looks sweet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can bring her down but you cant show her to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can smuggle her out the way you smuggled her in and take her back to her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where on earth do you get your notions borrowing a baby for sunday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre so used to a house without a baby you dont know how dull it is sighed rebecca resignedly as she moved towards the door but at the farm there was always a nice fresh one to play with and cuddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were too many but thats not half as bad as none at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shell be dreadfully disappointed and so will mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps i can go up there and take care of the baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i brought her home so t i could do my saturday work just the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got enough to do right here without any borrowed babies to make more steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now no answering back just give the child some supper and carry it home where it belongs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont want me to go down the front way hadnt i better just come through this room and let you look at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has yellow hair and big blue eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss miranda smiled acidly as she said she couldnt take after her father for hed take any thing there was before she got there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aunt jane was in the linen closet upstairs sorting out the clean sheets and pillow cases for saturday and rebecca sought comfort from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i brought the simpson baby home aunt jane thinking it would help us over a dull sunday but aunt miranda wont let her stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emma jane has the promise of her next sunday and alice robinson the next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> simpson wanted i should have her first because ive had so much experience in babies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come in and look at her sitting up in my bed aunt jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes the fat gurgly kind not thin and fussy like some babies and i thought i was going to have her to undress and dress twice each day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could have a printed book with everything set down in it that i could do and then i wouldnt get disappointed so often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no book could be printed that would fit you rebecca answered aunt jane for nobody could imagine beforehand the things youd want to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you going to carry that heavy child home in your arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no im going to drag her in the little soapwagon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take your thumb out of your mouth and come to ride with becky in your gocart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stretched out her strong young arms to the crowing baby sat down in a chair with the child turned her upside down unceremoniously took from her waistband and scornfully flung away a crooked pin walked with her still in a highly reversed position to the bureau selected a large safety pin and proceeded to attach her brief red flannel petticoat to a sort of shirt that she wore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether flat on her stomach or head down heels in the air the simpson baby knew she was in the hands of an expert and continued gurgling placidly while aunt jane regarded the pantomime with a kind of dazed awe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless my soul rebecca she ejaculated it beats all how handy you are with babies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to be ive brought up three and a half of em rebecca responded cheerfully pulling up the infant simpsons stockings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think youd be fonder of dolls than you are said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do like them but theres never any change in a doll its always the same everlasting old doll and you have to make believe its cross or sick or it loves you or cant bear you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss jane stretched out a thin hand with a slender worn band of gold on the finger and the baby curled her dimpled fingers round it and held it fast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wear a ring on your engagement finger dont you aunt jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a soldier and he died of a gunshot wound in a hospital down south <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes young and brave and handsome rebecca he was mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane looked back across the halfforgotten years and the vision of toms gladness flashed upon her his haggard smile the tears in his tired eyes his outstretched arms his weak voice saying oh jenny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had never breathed a word of it before to a human creature for there was no one who would have understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now in a shamefaced way to hide her brimming eyes she put her head down on the young shoulder beside her saying it was hard rebecca <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the simpson baby had cuddled down sleepily in rebeccas lap leaning her head back and sucking her thumb contentedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rebecca put her cheek down until it touched her aunts gray hair and softly patted her as she said im sorry aunt jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls eyes were soft and tender and the heart within her stretched a little and grew grew in sweetness and intuition and depth of feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had looked into another heart felt it beat and heard it sigh and that is how all hearts grow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> episodes like these enlivened the quiet course of everyday existence made more quiet by the departure of dick carter living perkins and huldah meserve for wareham and the small attendance at the winter school from which the younger children of the place stayed away during the cold weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> life however could never be thoroughly dull or lacking in adventure to a child of rebeccas temperament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her nature was full of adaptability fluidity receptivity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made friends everywhere she went and snatched up acquaintances in every corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the nightbirds of the streets and the noisy fiacre drivers outside and to the crowd of guests who stood on the high marble steps waiting for their turn to depart he might have been relating an amusing anecdote of the ball just over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im in great trouble old man was what he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id ask you to my rooms but they watch me all the time and i dont want them to suspect you are in this until they must <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go on in the carriage but get out as you pass clay smiled apparently in great amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he crossed over to where king stood surveying the powdered beauties of olancho and their gowns of a past fashion with an intensity of admiration which would have been suspicious to those who knew his tastes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we get into the carriage said clay in a low voice we will both call to stuart that we stuart helped miss langham into her carriage and as it moved away king shouted to him in english to remember that he was breakfasting with him on the morrow and clay called out in spanish until tomorrow at breakfast dont forget <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as their carriage jolted through the dark and narrow street empty now of all noise or movement one of stuarts troopers dashed by it at a gallop with a lighted lantern swinging at his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raised it as he passed each street crossing and held it high above his head so that its light fell upon the walls of the houses at the four corners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clatter of his horses hoofs had not ceased before another trooper galloped toward them riding more slowly and throwing the light of his lantern over the trunks of the trees that lined the pavements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the carriage passed him he brought his horse to its side with a jerk of the bridle and swung his lantern in the faces of its occupants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> free men clay answered again and pointed at the star on his coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the soldier muttered an apology and striking his heels into his horses side dashed noisily away his lantern tossing from side to side high in the air as he drew rein to scan each tree and passed from one lamppost to the next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> langham did he take us for it is the custom said clay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are out rather late you if i remember rightly clay said king they gave a ball at i believe they did said clay smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke to the driver to stop the carriage and stepped down into the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have to leave you here he said drive on quickly the plaza bolivar stood in what had once been the centre of the fashionable life of olancho but the town had moved farther up the hill and it was now far in the suburbs its walks neglected and its turf overrun with weeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the houses about it had fallen into disuse and the few that were still occupied at the time clay entered it showed no sign of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clay picked his way over the grassgrown paths to the statue of bolivar the hero of the sister republic of venezuela which still stood on its pedestal in a tangle of underbrush and hanging vines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the iron railing that had once surrounded it was broken down and the branches of the trees near were black with sleeping buzzards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two great palms reared themselves in the moonlight at either side and beat their leaves together in the night wind whispering and murmuring together like two living conspirators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this ought to be safe enough clay murmured to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seated himself on the steps of the pedestal and lighting a cigar remained smoking and peering into the shadows about him until a shadow blacker than the darkness rose at his feet and a voice said sternly put out that light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw it clay rose and crushed his cigar under his foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now then old man he demanded briskly whats up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its nearly daylight stuart seated himself heavily on the stone steps like a man tired in mind and body and unfolded a printed piece of paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its blank side was damp and sticky with paste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is too dark for you to see this he began in a strained voice so i will translate it to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is an attack on madame alvarez and myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they put them up during the ball when they knew my men would be at the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have had them scouring the streets for the last two hours tearing them down but they are all over the place in the cafes and clubs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they clay took another cigar from his pocket and rolled it between his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it says alvarez has given the richest birthright of his country to aliensthat means the mines and langhamand has put an alien in command of the army that is meant for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive no more to do with the army than you havei only wish i had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then it says that the boundary aggressions of ecuador and venezuela have not been resented in consequence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it asks what can be expected of a president who is as blind to the dishonor of his country as he is to the dishonor clay muttered under his breath well go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is quite have you got any of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you fix it on mendoza did it of course stuart answered but we cannot prove it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if we could we are not strong enough to take him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has the city full of his men now and the troops are pouring they are coming in for the annual review <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cant show the what am i going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is what i want you to tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive brought trouble and insult on people who have been kinder to me than my own blood have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who took me in when i was naked and clothed me when i hadnt a friend or a sixpence to my name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you rememberi came here from that row in colombia with my wound and i was down with the fever when they found me and alvarez gave me the appointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i go away i leave them surrounded by enemies and not enemies who fight fair but damned thieves and scoundrels who stab at women and who fight in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt have had it happen old man for my right arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theythey have been so kind to me and i have been so happy hereand now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy bowed his face in his hands and sat breathing brokenly while clay turned his unlit cigar between his teeth and peered at him curiously through the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looks a great deal like it she said half putting aside her despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i talk to her but i want to come home to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had taken off his collar and tie and rose barethroated to go to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he stooped to kiss his mother she threw her arms round his neck hid her face on his shoulder and cried i cant bear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shed leave me no room not a bit of room and immediately he hated miriam bitterly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ive neveryou know paulive never had a husbandnot really he stroked his mothers hair and his mouth was on her throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she exults so in taking you from meshes not like ordinary girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont love her mother he murmured bowing his head and hiding his eyes on her shoulder in misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother kissed him a long fervent kiss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said in a voice trembling with passionate love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there said his mother now go to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she was speaking she heard her husband coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly she looked at him almost as if in fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you want her take her my boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother looked so strange paul kissed her trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hat was over one corner of his eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morels emotion turned into sudden hate of the drunkard who had come in thus upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate it is sober she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went into the passage hung up his hat and coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they heard him go down three steps to the pantry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he returned with a piece of porkpie in his fist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you can give me no more than twentyfive shillings im sure im not going to buy you porkpie to stuff after youve swilled a bellyful of beer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at the piece of meat and crust and suddenly in a vicious spurt of temper flung it into the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly shouted morel jumping up and clenching his fist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said paul viciously putting his head on one side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would at that moment dearly have loved to have a smack at something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morel was half crouching fists up ready to spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man stood smiling with his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hissed the father swiping round with a great stroke just past his sons face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dared not even though so close really touch the young man but swerved an inch away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said paul his eyes upon the side of his fathers mouth where in another instant his fist would have hit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he heard a faint moan from behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother was deadly pale and dark at the mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morel was dancing up to deliver another blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her open eyes watched him although she could not move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laid her down on the sofa and ran upstairs for a little whisky which at last she could sip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he kneeled in front of her he did not cry but the tears ran down his face quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morel on the opposite side of the room sat with his elbows on his knees glaring across <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elderly man began to unlace his boots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his last fight was fought in that home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he rose fetched in a large piece of coal and raked the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he cleared the room put everything straight laid the things for breakfast and brought his mothers candle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rose and he turned out the gas then followed her closely upstairs carrying her candle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pressed his face upon the pillow in a fury of misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet somewhere in his soul he was at peace because he still loved his mother best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the efforts of his father to conciliate him next day were a great humiliation to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul was dissatisfied with himself and with everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deepest of his love belonged to his mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he felt he had hurt her or wounded his love for her he could not bear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it was spring and there was battle between him and miriam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this year he had a good deal against her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old feeling that she was to be a sacrifice to this love which she had had when she prayed was mingled in all her emotions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not at the bottom believe she ever would have him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not believe in herself primarily doubted whether she could ever be what he would demand of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly she never saw herself living happily through a lifetime with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in sacrifice she was proud in renunciation she was strong for she did not trust herself to support everyday life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was prepared for the big things and the deep things like tragedy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the sufficiency of the small daylife she could not trust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the sunday afternoon she stood at her bedroom window looking across at the oaktrees of the wood in whose branches a twilight was tangled below the bright sky of the afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greygreen rosettes of honeysuckle leaves hung before the window some already she fancied showing bud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was spring which she loved and dreaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hearing the clack of the gate she stood in suspense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul came into the yard with his bicycle which glittered as he walked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> usually he rang his bell and laughed towards the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> today he walked with shut lips and cold cruel bearing that had something of a slouch and a sneer in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew him well by now and could tell from that keenlooking aloof young body of his what was happening inside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a cold correctness in the way he put his bicycle in its place that made her heart sink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was wearing a new net blouse that she thought became her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had a high collar with a tiny ruff reminding her of mary queen of scots and making her she thought look wonderfully a woman and dignified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at twenty she was fullbreasted and luxuriously formed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her face was still like a soft rich mask unchangeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he being in a hard ironical mood was entertaining the family to a description of a service given in the primitive methodist chapel conducted by one of the wellknown preachers of the sect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat at the head of the table his mobile face with the eyes that could be so beautiful shining with tenderness or dancing with laughter now taking on one expression and then another in imitation of various people he was mocking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mockery always hurt her it was too near the reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt that when his eyes were like this hard with mocking hate he would spare neither himself nor anybody else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leivers was wiping her eyes with laughter and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leivers just awake from his sunday nap was rubbing his head in amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the three brothers sat with ruffled sleepy appearance in their shirtsleeves giving a guffaw from time to time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole family loved a takeoff more than anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later she saw him remark her new blouse saw that the artist approved but it won from him not a spark of warmth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was nervous could hardly reach the teacups from the shelves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the men went out to milk she ventured to address him personally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you come and look at the daffodils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went out into the back garden under the budding damsontrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hills and the sky were clean and cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed cruel to her that his eyes and brows which she loved could look so hurting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she detected an underneath feeling of weariness about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be rough on the roadthe wood moans so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can see by the clouds its a southwest wind that helps me here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i dont cycle so i dont understand she murmured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there need to cycle to know that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> round the wild tussocky lawn at the back of the house was a thorn hedge under which daffodils were craning forward from among their sheaves of greygreen blades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cheeks of the flowers were greenish with cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still some had burst and their gold ruffled and glowed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miriam went on her knees before one cluster took a wildlooking daffodil between her hands turned up its face of gold to her and bowed down caressing it with her mouth and cheeks and brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood aside with his hands in his pockets watching her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one after another she turned up to him the faces of the yellow bursten flowers appealingly fondling them lavishly all the while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she bowed again to her flowers at his censure of her praise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he watched her crouching sipping the flowers with fervid kisses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i love to touch them she replied hurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you never like things without clutching them as if you wanted to pull the heart out of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont you have a bit more restraint or reserve or something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked up at him full of pain then continued slowly to stroke her lips against a ruffled flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their scent as she smelled it was so much kinder than he it almost made her cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wheedle the soul out of things he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would never wheedleat any rate id go straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his body seemed one weapon firm and hard against her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre always begging things to love you he said as if you were a beggar for love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the flowers you have to fawn on them rhythmically miriam was swaying and stroking the flower with her mouth inhaling the scent which ever after made her shudder as it came to her nostrils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont want to loveyour eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you absorb absorb as if you must fill yourself up with love because youve got a shortage somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was stunned by his cruelty and did not hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not the faintest notion of what he was saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as if his fretted tortured soul run hot by thwarted passion jetted off these sayings like sparks from electricity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she only sat crouched beneath his cruelty and his hatred of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after tea he stayed with edgar and the brothers taking no notice of miriam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she extremely unhappy on this lookedfor holiday waited for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at last he yielded and came to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was determined to track this mood of his to its origin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she counted it not much more than a mood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall we go through the wood a little way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked him knowing he never refused a direct request <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the middle path they passed a trap a narrow horseshoe hedge of small firboughs baited with the guts of a rabbit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it worse than a weasel with its teeth in a rabbits throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was taking the bitterness of life badly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will go back to the house he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went past the lilactree whose bronze leafbuds were coming unfastened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just a fragment remained of the haystack a monument squared and brown like a pillar of stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a little bed of hay from the last cutting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us sit here a minute said miriam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat down against his will resting his back against the hard wall of hay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they faced the amphitheatre of round hills that glowed with sunset tiny white farms standing out the meadows golden the woods dark and yet luminous treetops folded over treetops distinct in the distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the evening had cleared and the east was tender with a magenta flush under which the land lay still and rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would rather have had it ugly just then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that moment a big bullterrier came rushing up openmouthed pranced his two paws on the youths shoulders licking his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pushed the dog aside but it came leaping back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get out said the lad or ill dot thee one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the dog was not to be pushed away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so paul had a little battle with the creature pitching poor bill away from him who however only floundered tumultuously back again wild with joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two fought together the man laughing grudgingly the dog grinning all over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted so badly to love to be tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rough way he bowled the dog over was really loving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bill got up panting with happiness his brown eyes rolling in his white face and lumbered back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bill ive had enough o thee he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the dog only stood with two heavy paws that quivered with love upon his thigh and flickered a red tongue at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in a minute the dog trotted off happily to vary the fun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remained staring miserably across at the hills whose still beauty he begrudged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted to go and cycle with edgar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet he had not the courage to leave miriam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not sad why should i be he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wondered why he always claimed to be normal when he was disagreeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he picked up a stick and began to stab the earth with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thrust thrust thrust at the ground with the pointed stick digging up little clods of earth as if he were in a fever of irritation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be easily believed that the princes disinclination to marry again contented sophie very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the fact that he had no direct heir was one in which she saw possibilities advantageous to herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the course of nature he was almost bound to predecease her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wealth was enormous and out of it sophie wanted as much by bequest as she could get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was much too shrewd however to imagine that even if she did contrive to be made his sole heir the influential families who had an eye upon the great possessions of the prince and who through relationship had some right to expect inheritance would allow such a will to go uncontested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she therefore looked about among the princes connexions for some one who would accept coheirship with herself and whose family would be strong enough in position to carry through probate on such terms but at the same time would be grateful enough to her and venal enough to further her aim of being reinstated at court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her choice in this matter shows at once her political cunning which would include knowledge of affairs and her ability as a judge of character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it should be remembered that in spite of his title of duc de bourbon sophies elderly protector was only distantly of that family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was descended in direct line from the princes de conde whose connexion with the royal house of france dated back to the sixteenth century <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other line of royal ducs in the country was that of orleans offshoot of the royal house through philippe son of louis xiii and born in sophies protector louishenrijoseph prince de conde having married louisemarie daughter of the greatgrandson of this philippe was thus the brotherinlaw of that louisphilippe duc dorleans who in the revolution was known as egalite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a man whom for his political opinion and for his failure to stand by the king louis xvi the prince de conde utterly detested in memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as much moreover as he had hated the father did the prince de conde detest egalites son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was out of this mans family that sophie selected though ultimately her coheir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before she arrived at this point however sophie had been at pains to do some not very savoury manoeuvring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by a dancer at the opera called mimi the prince de conde had an illegitimate daughter whom he had caused to be educated and whom he had married to the comte de rully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the comtesse de rully and her husband had a suite at chantilly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was an arrangement which sophie as reigning queen of chantilly did not like at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the rully woman remained at chantilly sophie could not think that her sway over the prince was quite as absolute as she wished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took her six years of badgering her protector from to to bring about the eviction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but meantime for sophies machinations must be taken as concurrent with events as they transpire the baronne de feucheres had approached the son of philippeegalite suggesting that the lastborn of his six children the duc daumale should have the prince de conde for godfather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she could persuade her protector to this the duc dorleans in return was to use his influence for her reinstatement at court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and persuade the old man to this sophie did albeit after a great deal of badgering on her part and a great deal of grumbling on the part of the prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the influence exerted at court by the duc dorleans does not seem to have been very effective <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king who had dismissed her the court louis xviii died in his brother the comte dartois ascended the throne as charles x and continued by politically foolish recourses comparable in history to those of the english stuarts to alienate the people by attempting to regain that anachronistic absolute power which the revolution had destroyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lasted a mere six years as king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but up to the last month or so of those six years he steadfastly refused to have anything to do with the baronne de feucheresnot that sophie ever gave up manoeuvring and wheedling for a return to court favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about sophie had a secret proposition made to the king that she should try to persuade the prince de conde to adopt as his heir one of the brothers of the duchesse de berry widow of the kings second sonor would his majesty mind if a son of the duc after that sophie pinned her faith in the power possessed by the duc dorleans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not ready to pursue the course whereby her return to court might have been securednamely to abandon her equivocal position in the prince de condes household and thus her power over the prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wanted first to make sure of her share of the fortune he would leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew her power over the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already she had persuaded him to buy and make over to her the estates of saintleu and boissy as well as to make her legacies to the amount of a million francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> much as she wanted to be received again at court she wanted more just as much as she could grab from the princes estate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make her inheritance secure she needed the help of the duc dorleans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had the mind of a french bourgeois and all the bourgeois itch for money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that the prince de conde hated him hated his politics hated his very name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but during the seven years it took sophie to bring the prince to the point of signing the will she had in mind the son of philippeegalite fawned like a huckster on his elderly and in more senses than one distant relative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scheme was to have the prince adopt the little duc daumale already his godchild as his heir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ways by which sophie went about the job of persuading her old lover do not read pleasantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hated the very idea of making a willit made him think of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sophie made his life a hell but he had become dependent upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she illused him subjecting him to physical violence but yet he was afraid she might as she often threatened leave him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her way of persuading him reached the point it is on record of putting a knife to his throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not once but several times his servants found him scratched and bruised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the old man could not summon up the strength of mind to be quit of this succubine virago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last on the th of august sophies persuasions succeeded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prince consented to sign the will and did so the following morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in its terms the duc daumale became residuary legatee and francs free of deathduty were bequeathed to the princes faithful companion mme la baronne de feucheres together with the chateaux and estates of saintleutaverny boissy enghien montmorency and mortefontaine and the pavilion in the palaisbourbon besides all the princes furniture carriages horses and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover the estate and chateau of ecouen was also given her on condition that she allowed the latter to be used as an orphanage for the descendants of soldiers who had served with the armies of conde and la vendee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cost of running this establishment however was to be borne by the duc daumale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might be thought that sophie having got her way would have turned to kindness in her treatment of her old lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all her mind was now concentrated on working through the duc dorleans for being received again at court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the th of february she appeared in the presence of the king the dauphin and dauphine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the business of preparing for this great day chantilly and the prince de conde were greatly neglected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beggar on horseback had to be about paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but events were shaping in france at that time which were to be important to the royal family to sophie and her supporters of the house of orleans and fatal in consequence to the old man at chantilly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house crowded with effects the bustling housewife counting her possessions the serious indoctrinated island pastor the long fight for life in the lagoon here are traits of a new world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i read in a pamphlet i will not give the authors name that the marquesan especially resembles the paumotuan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should take the two races though so near in neighbourhood to be extremes of polynesian diversity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquesan is certainly the most beautiful of human races and one of the tallest the paumotuan averaging a good inch shorter and not even handsome the marquesan openhanded inert insensible to religion childishly selfindulgent the paumotuan greedy hardy enterprising a religious disputant and with a trace of the ascetic character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet a few years ago and the people of the archipelago were crafty savages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their isles might be called sirens isles not merely from the attraction they exerted on the passing mariner but from the perils that awaited him on shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even to this day in certain outlying islands danger lingers and the civilized paumotuan dreads to land and hesitates to accost his backward brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but except in these today the peril is a memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when our generation were yet in the cradle and playroom it was still a living fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between and hao for instance was a place of the most dangerous approach where ships were seized and crews kidnapped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as late as the schooner sarah ann sailed from papeete and was seen no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had women on board and children the captains wife a nursemaid a baby and the two young sons of a captain steven on their way to the mainland for schooling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all were supposed to have perished in a squall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a year later the captain of the julia coasting along the island variously called bligh lagoon and tematangi saw armed natives follow the course of his schooner clad in manycoloured stuffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suspicion was at once aroused the mother of the lost children was profuse of money and one expedition having found the place deserted and returned content with firing a few shots she raised and herself accompanied another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none appeared to greet or to oppose them they roamed a while among abandoned huts and empty thickets then formed two parties and set forth to beat from end to end the pandanus jungle of the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one man remained alone by the landingplace teina a chief of anaa leader of the armed natives who made the strength of the expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that his comrades were departed this way and that on their laborious exploration the silence fell profound and this silence was the ruin of the islanders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sound of stones rattling caught the ear of teina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked thinking to perceive a crab and saw instead the brown hand of a human being issue from a fissure in the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a shout recalled the search parties and announced their doom to the buried caitiffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the cave below sixteen were found crouching among human bones and singular and horrid curiosities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one was a head of golden hair supposed to be a relic of the captains wife another was half of the body of a european child sundried and stuck upon a stick doubtless with some design of wizardry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saves grudges buries money fears not work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a dollar each two natives passed the hours of daylight cleaning our ships copper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was strange to see them so indefatigable and so much at ease in the water working at times with their pipes lighted the smoker at times submerged and only the glowing bowl above the surface it was stranger still to think they were next congeners to the incapable marquesan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the paumotuan not only saves grudges and works he steals besides or to be more precise he swindles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will never deny a debt he only flees his creditor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is always keen for an advance so soon as he has fingered it he disappears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knows your ship so soon as it nears one island he is off to another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may think you know his name he has already changed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pursuit in that infinity of isles were fruitless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result can be given in a nutshell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has been actually proposed in a government report to secure debts by taking a photograph of the debtor and the other day in papeete credits on the paumotus to the amount of sixteen thousand pounds were sold for less than forty quatre cent mille francs pour moins de mille francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even so the purchase was thought hazardous and only the man who made it and who had special opportunities could have dared to give so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the paumotuan is sincerely attached to those of his own blood and household <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a touching affection sometimes unites wife and husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their children while they are alive completely rule them after they are dead their bones or their mummies are often jealously preserved and carried from atoll to atoll in the wanderings of the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was told there were many houses in fakarava with the mummy of a child locked in a seachest after i heard it i would glance a little jealously at those by my own bed in that cupboard also it was possible there was a tiny skeleton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the race seems in a fair way to survive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from fifteen islands whose rolls i had occasion to consult i found a proportion of births to deaths for dropping three out of the fifteen there remained for the other twelve the comfortable ratio of births to deaths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long habits of hardship and activity doubtless explain the contrast with marquesan figures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the paumotuan displays besides a certain concern for health and the rudiments of a sanitary discipline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> public talk with these free spoken people plays the part of the contagious diseases act in comers to fresh islands anxiously inquire if all be well and syphilis when contracted is successfully treated with indigenous herbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like their neighbours of tahiti from whom they have perhaps imbibed the error they regard leprosy with comparative indifference elephantiasis with disproportionate fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but unlike indeed to the tahitian their alarm puts on the guise of selfdefence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any one stricken with this painful and ugly malady is confined to the ends of villages denied the use of paths and highways and condemned to transport himself between his house and cocopatch by water only his very footprint being held infectious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> feefee being a creature of marshes and the sequel of malarial fever is not original in atolls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the single isle of makatea where the lagoon is now a marsh the disease has made a home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wilmot be right from much of the comfort of society and it is believed they take a secret vengeance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the defections of the sick are considered highly poisonous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early in the morning it is narrated aged and malicious persons creep into the sleeping village and stealthily make water at the doors of the houses of young men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus they propagate disease thus they breathe on and obliterate comeliness and health the objects of their envy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether horrid fact or more abominable legend it equally depicts that something bitter and energetic which distinguishes paumotuan man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the archipelago is divided between two main religions catholic and mormon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they front each other proudly with a false air of permanence yet are but shapes their membership in a perpetual flux <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mormon attends mass with devotion the catholic sits attentive at a mormon sermon and tomorrow each may have transferred allegiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one man had been a pillar of the church of rome for fifteen years his wife dying he decided that must be a poor religion that could not save a man his wife and turned mormon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to one informant catholicism was the more fashionable in health but on the approach of sickness it was judged prudent to secede <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a mormon there were five chances out of six you might recover as a catholic your hopes were small and this opinion is perhaps founded on the comfortable rite of unction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all know what catholics are whether in the paumotus or at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the paumotuan mormon seemed a phenomenon apart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he marries but the one wife uses the protestant bible observes protestant forms of worship forbids the use of liquor and tobacco practises adult baptism by immersion and after every public sin rechristens the backslider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i advised with mahinui whom i found well informed in the history of the american mormons and he declared against the least connection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pour moi said he with a fine charity les mormons ici un petit catholiques <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some months later i had an opportunity to consult an orthodox fellowcountryman an old dissenting highlander long settled in tahiti but still breathing of the heather of tiree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for by all that i can hear of their doctrine i have nothing to say against it and their life it is above reproach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for all that mormons they are but of the earlier sowing the socalled josephites the followers of joseph smith the opponents of brigham young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fresh points at once arise what are the israelites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a long while back the sect had been divided into mormons proper and so called israelites i never could hear why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few years since there came a visiting missionary of the name of williams who made an excellent collection and retired leaving fresh disruption imminent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something irregular as i was told in his way of opening the service had raised partisans and enemies the church was once more rent asunder and a new sect the kanitu issued from the division <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since then kanitus and israelites like the cameronians and the united presbyterians have made common cause and the ecclesiastical history of the paumotus is for the moment uneventful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there will be more doing before long and these isles bid fair to be the scotland of the south <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nature of the innovations of the rev <end> <end> 
<start> <start> williams none would tell me and of the meaning of the name kanitu none had a guess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not tahitian it was not marquesan it formed no part of that ancient speech of the paumotus now passing swiftly into obsolescence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said it was the latin for a little dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have found it since as the name of a god in new guinea it must be a bolder man than i who should hint at a connection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here then is a singular thing a brandnew sect arising by popular acclamation and a nonsense word invented for its name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think i said that the heavy sea which you told me came aboard just then might have killed the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen the sheer weight of a sea kill a man very neatly by simply breaking his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he uttered impressively fixing his smeary blue eyes on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no man killed by the sea ever looked like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as i gazed at him certainly not prepared for anything original on his part he advanced his head close to mine and thrust his tongue out at me so suddenly that i couldnt help starting back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after scoring over my calmness in this graphic way he nodded wisely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had seen the sight he assured me i would never forget it as long as i lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the weather was too bad to give the corpse a proper sea burial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so next day at dawn they took it up on the poop covering its face with a bit of bunting he read a short prayer and then just as it was in its oilskins and long boots they launched it amongst those mountainous seas that seemed ready every moment to swallow up the ship herself and the terrified lives on board of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that reefed foresail saved you i threw in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was by a special mercy i firmly believe that it stood some of those hurricane squalls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the setting of that sail which i began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gods own hand in it he interrupted me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mind telling you that i hardly dared give the order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he showed the solid principles upon which the enterprise was founded and the advantage that must attend its success and the glory it must shed upon the spanish crown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isabella being warm and generous of nature and sanguine of disposition was moved by the representations of juan perez and requested that columbus might be again sent to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bethinking herself of his poverty and his humble plight she ordered that money should be forwarded to him sufficient to bear his traveling expenses and to furnish him with decent raiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the worthy friar lost no time in communicating the result of his mission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he transmitted the money and a letter by the hand of an inhabitant of palos to the physician garcia fernandez who delivered them to columbus the latter immediately changed his threadbare garb for one more suited to the sphere of a court and purchasing a mule set out again reanimated by hopes for the camp before granada <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time after some delay his mission was attended with success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the generous spirit of isabella was enkindled and it seemed as if the subject for the first time broke upon her mind in all its real grandeur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she declared her resolution to undertake the enterprise but paused for a moment remembering that king ferdinand looked coldly on the affair and that the royal treasury was absolutely drained by the war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with an enthusiasm worthy of herself and of the cause she exclaimed i undertake the enterprise for my own crown of castile and will pledge my jewels to raise the necessary funds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the proudest moment in the life of isabella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it stamped her renown forever as the patroness of the discovery of the new world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when columbus left the canaries to pass with his three small ships into the unknown seas the eruptions of teneriffe illuminated the heavens and were reflected in the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this cast terror into the minds of his seamen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they thought that it was the flaming sword of the angel who expelled the first man from eden and who now was trying to drive back in anger those presumptuous ones who were seeking entrance to the forbidden and unknown seas and lands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the admiral passed from ship to ship explaining to his men in a simple way the action of volcanoes so that the sailors were no longer afraid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as the peak of teneriffe sank below the horizon a great sadness fell upon the men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was their last beacon the farthest seamark of the old world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were seized with a nameless terror and loneliness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the admiral called them around him in his own ship and told them many stories of the things they might hope to find in the wonderful new world to which they were goingof the lands the islands the seas the kingdoms the riches the vegetation the sunshine the mines of gold the sands covered with pearls the mountains shining with precious stones the plains loaded with spices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these stories tinged with the brilliant colors of their leaders rich imagination filled the discouraged sailors with hope and good spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as they passed over the trackless ocean and saw day by day the great billows rolling between them and the mysterious horizon the sailors were again filled with dread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they lacked the courage to sail onward into the unknown distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the compass began to vacillate and no longer pointed toward the north this confused both columbus and his pilots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men fell into a panic but the resolute and patient admiral encouraged them once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so buoyed up by his faith and hope they continued to sail onwards over the pathless waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day a heron and a tropical bird flew about the masts of the ships and these seemed to the wondering sailors as two witnesses come to confirm the reasoning of columbus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the weather was mild and serene the sky clear the waves transparent the dolphins played across the bows the airs were warm and the perfumes which the waves brought from afar seemed to exhale from their foam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brilliancy of the stars and the deep beauty of the night breathed a feeling of calm security that comforted and sustained the sailors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sea also began to bring its messages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some were rockplants that had been swept off the cliffs by the waves some were freshwater plants and others recently torn from their roots were still full of sap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them carried a live craba little sailor afloat on a tuft of grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these plants and living things could not have passed many days in the water without fading and dying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all encouraged the sailors to believe that they were nearing land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at eve and morning the distant waning clouds like those that gather round the mountaintops took the form of cliffs and hills skirting the horizon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cry of land was on the tip of every tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but columbus by his reckoning knew that they must still be far from any land but fearing to discourage his men he kept his thoughts to himself for he found no trustworthy friend among his companions whose heart was firm enough to bear his secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the long passage columbus conversed with his own thoughts and with the stars and with god whom he felt was his protector <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he occupied his days in making notes of what he observed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nights he passed on deck with his pilots studying the stars and watching the seas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he withdrew into himself and his thoughtful gravity impressed his companions sometimes with respect and sometimes with mistrust and awe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each morning the bows of the vessels plunged through the fantastic horizon which the evening mist had made the sailors mistake for a shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they kept rolling on through the boundless and bottomless abyss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gradually terror and discontent once more took possession of the crews <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they began to imagine that the steadfast east wind that drove them westward prevailed eternally in this region and that when the time came to sail homeward the same wind would prevent their return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for surely their provisions and water could not hold out long enough for them to beat their way eastward over those wide waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the sailors began to murmur against the admiral and his seeming fruitless obstinacy and they blamed themselves for obeying him when it might mean the sacrifice of the lives of one hundred and twenty sailors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but each time the murmurs threatened to break out into mutiny providence seemed to send more encouraging signs of land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and these for the time being changed the complaints to hopes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at evening little birds of the most delicate species that build their nests in the shrubs of the garden and orchard hovered warbling about the masts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their delicate wings and joyous notes bore no signs of weariness or fright as of birds swept far away to sea by a storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the green weeds on the surface of the ocean looked like waving corn before the ears are ripe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vegetation beneath the water delighted the eyes of the sailors tired of the endless expanse of blue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the seaweed soon became so thick that they were afraid of entangling their rudders and keels and of remaining prisoners forever in the forests of the ocean as ships of the northern seas are shut in by ice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus each joy soon turned to fearso terrible to man is the unknown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind ceased the calms of the tropics alarmed the sailors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an immense whale was seen sleeping on the waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they fancied there were monsters in the deep which would devour their ships <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the roll of the waves drove them upon currents which they could not stem for want of wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they imagined they were approaching the cataracts of the ocean and that they were being hurried toward the abysses into which the deluge had poured its world of waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fierce and angry faces crowded round the mast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they talked of compelling the pilots to put about and of throwing the admiral into the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> columbus to whom their looks and threats revealed these plans defied them by his bold bearing or disconcerted them by his coolness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again nature came to his assistance by giving him fresh breezes from the east and a calm sea under his bows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the close of the day came the first cry of land ho <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the crews repeating this cry of safety life and triumph fell on their knees on the decksand struck up the hymn glory be to god in heaven and upon earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it was over all climbed as high as they could up the masts yards and rigging to see with their own eyes the new land that had been sighted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the sunrise destroyed this new hope all too quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the imaginary land disappeared with the morning mist and once more the ships seemed to be sailing over a neverending wilderness of waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the sailors found as before that their hopes were but a passing cloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing wearies the heart so much as false hopes and bitter disappointments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loud reproaches against the admiral were heard from every quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men decided to turn the heads of the vessels toward europe and to beat back against the winds that had favored the admiral whom they intended to chain to the mast of his own vessel and to give up to the vengeance of spain should they ever reach the port of their own country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the admiral restrained them by the calmness of his countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called upon heaven to decide between himself and the sailors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he offered his life as a pledge if they would but trust and wait for three days more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he swore that if in the course of the third day land was not visible on the horizon he would yield to their wishes and steer for europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mutinous men reluctantly consented and allowed him three days of grace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sunrise on the second day rushes recently torn up were seen floating near the vessels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a plank hewn by an axe a carved stick a bough of hawthorn in blossom and lastly a birds nest built on a branch which the wind had broken and full of eggs on which the parentbird was sitting were seen swimming past on the waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sailors brought on board these living witnesses of their approach to land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had often enough indeed pictured myself advanced to be a marshal a duke of the empire a grand cross of the legion of honour and some other kickshaws of the kind with a perfect rout of flunkeys correctly dressed in my own colours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is one thing to imagine and another to see it would be one thing to have these liveries in a house of my own in paris it was quite another to find them flaunting in the heart of hostile england and i fear i should have made a fool of myself if the man had not been on the other side of the street and i at a onepane window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something illusory in this transplantation of the wealth and honours of a family a thing by its nature so deeply rooted in the soil something ghostly in this sense of homecoming so far from home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from dunstable i rolled away into a crescendo of similar impressions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are certainly few things to be compared with these castles or rather country seats of the english nobility and gentry nor anything at all to equal the servility of the population that dwells in their neighbourhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though i was but driving in a hired chaise word of my destination seemed to have gone abroad and the women curtseyed and the men louted to me by the wayside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i came near i began to appreciate the roots of this widespread respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the look of my uncles park wall even from the outside had something of a princely character and when i came in view of the house itself a sort of madness of vicarious vainglory struck me dumb and kept me staring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was about the size of the tuileries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it faced due north and the last rays of the sun that was setting like a redhot shot amidst a tumultuous gathering of snow clouds were reflected on the endless rows of windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a portico of doric columns adorned the front and would have done honour to a temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the servant who received me at the door was civil to a fault i had almost said to offence and the hall to which he admitted me through a pair of glass doors was warmed and already partly lighted by a liberal chimney heaped with the roots of beeches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yves said i in answer to the mans question whereupon he bowed before me lower still and stepping upon one side introduced me to the truly awful presence of the majordomo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen many dignitaries in my time but none who quite equalled this eminent being who was good enough to answer to the unassuming name of dawson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from him i learned that my uncle was extremely low a doctor in close attendance mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> romaine expected at any moment and that my cousin the vicomte de st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yves had been sent for the same morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he would scarcely go as far as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a decline a fading away sir but he was certainly took bad the day before had sent for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> romaine and the majordomo had taken it on himself a little later to send word to the viscount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me my lord said he as if this was a time when all the fambly should i approved him with my lips but not in my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dawson was plainly in the interests of my cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when can i expect to see my greatuncle the count <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the evening i was told in the meantime he would show me to my room which had been long prepared for me and i should be expected to dine in about an hour with the doctor if my lordship had no objections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time i said i have had an accident i have unhappily lost my baggage and am here in what i stand in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know if the doctor be a formalist but it is quite impossible i he begged me to be under no anxiety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have been long expecting such i found to be the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great room had been prepared for me through the mullioned windows the last flicker of the winter sunset interchanged with the reverberation of a royal fire the bed was open a suit of evening clothes was airing before the blaze and from the far corner a boy came forward with deprecatory smiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dream in which i had been moving seemed to have reached its pitch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might have quitted this house and room only the night before it was my own place that i had come to and for the first time in my life i understood the force of the words home and welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this will be all as you would want sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this ere boy rowley we place entirely at your disposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> es not exactly a trained vallet but mossho powl the viscounts gentleman ave give him the benefick of a few lessons and it is oped that he may give sitisfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hanythink that you may require if you will be so good as to mention the same to rowley i so saying the eminent and already detested mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dawson took his departure and i was left alone with rowley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man who may be said to have wakened to consciousness in the prison of the abbaye among those ever graceful and ever tragic figures of the brave and fair awaiting the hour of the guillotine and denuded of every comfort i had never known the luxuries or the amenities of my rank in life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be attended on by servants i had only been accustomed to in inns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my toilet had long been military to a moment at the note of a bugle too often at a ditchside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it need not be wondered at if i looked on my new valet with a certain diffidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i remembered that if he was my first experience of a valet i was his first trial as a master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cheered by which consideration i demanded my bath in a style of good assurance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a bathroom contiguous in an incredibly short space of time the hot water was ready and soon after arrayed in a shawl dressinggown and in a luxury of contentment and comfort i was reclined in an easychair before the mirror while rowley with a mixture of pride and anxiety which i could well understand laid out his razors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked not quite resigned to go under fire with such an inexperienced commander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all right i assure your i beg your pardon mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rowley but for the sake of shortness would you mind not belording me in private <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will do very well if you call me mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the way of my country as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youre just as much a viscount as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only you see as i am of the younger line i bear my christian name along with the title <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alain is the viscount i am the viscount anne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but about the shaving sir you need be under no alarm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that doesnt seem to me very like a french no sir indeed my lord said he with a burst of confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added with a confidential smile in the mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was about sixteen well set up with a pleasant merry freckled face and a pair of dancing eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an air at once deprecatory and insinuating about the rascal that i thought i recognised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came to me from my own boyhood memories of certain passionate admirations long passed away and the objects of them long ago discredited or dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remembered how anxious i had been to serve those fleeting heroes how readily i told myself i would have died for them how much greater and handsomer than life they had appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and looking in the mirror it seemed to me that i read the face of rowley like an echo or a ghost by the light of my own youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have always contended somewhat against the opinion of my friends that i am first of all an economist and the last thing that i would care to throw away is that very valuable piece of property a boys heroworship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may be sure sir i should never ave had this berth if i adnt ave been up to dick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we been expecting of you this month back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every day the fires has been kep up the bed made and all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as it was known you were coming sir i got the appointment and ive been up and down since then like a jackinthebox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wheel couldnt sound in the avenue but what i was at the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive had a many disappointments but tonight as soon as you stepped out of the shay i knew it was my it was you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why when i go down to supper ill be the ero of the servants well said i i hope you may be able to give a fair account of me sober steady industrious goodtempered and with a first he laughed an embarrassed laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your hair curls beautiful he said by way of changing the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the viscounts the boy for curls though and the richness of it is mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> powl tells me his dont curl no more than that much twine by nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gettin old the fact is said i that i know very little about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our family has been much divided and i have been a soldier from a a soldier mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had a long and intimate talk from which grew the abiding interest i feel in boys to day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally i was sometimes inconvenienced by slight misunderstandings between local committees and myself as to the subjects of my lectures and the most extreme instance of this occurred in a town where i arrived to find myself widely advertised as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> transfixed i gaped before the bill boards and by reading their additional lettering discovered the gratifying fact that at least i was not expected to whistle now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead it appeared as usual i had arrived in town only an hour or two before the time fixed for my lecture there was the briefest interval in which to clear up these pain ful misunderstandings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i repeatedly tried to reach the chairman who was to preside at the entertain ment but failed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last i went to the hall at the hour appointed and found the local committee there graciously waiting to receive me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without wasting precious minutes in preliminaries i asked why they had advertised me as the woman who had why didnt you whistle before her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover i was never called the american nightingale and i have never lectured on the missing link <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not on the the members of the committee seemed dazed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they withdrew to a corner and consulted in whis pers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with clearing brow the spokesman re turned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we mixed you up with a shaw lady that whistles and weve been discussing the missing link in our debating society so our citizens want to hear your but i dont know anything about the missing now come they begged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve sold all our tickets for that lecture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as i maintained a depressed silence one of them had a bright idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speak on any subject you please but bring in something about the missing link every few minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will satis very well i agreed reluctantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get the audience to sing america or the starspangled banner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will give me a few minutes to think and i will see led by a very nervous chairman the big audience began to sing and under the inspiration of the music the solution of our problem flashed into my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woman is the miss ing link in our government <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill give them a suf when the song ended i began my part of the en tertainment with a portion of my lecture on the fate of republics tracing their growth and decay and pointing out that what our republic needed to give it a stable government was the missing link of woman suffrage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got along admirably for every five minutes i mentioned the missing link and the audience sat content and apparently interested while the members of the committee burst into bloom on the platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my most dramatic experience occurred in a city in michigan where i was making a temperance campaign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an important lum ber and shipping center and it harbored much intemperance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the editor of the leading news paper was with the temperanceworkers in our fight there and he had warned me that the liquor people threatened to burn the building over my head if i attempted to lecture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were used to similar threats so i proceeded with my preparations and held the meeting in the town skatingrink a huge bare wooden structure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lectures were rare in that city and rumors of some special excitement on this occasion had been circulated every seat in the rink was filled and several hundred persons stood in the aisles and at the back of the building <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just opposite the speak ers platform was a small gallery and above that in the ceiling was a trapdoor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before i had been speaking ten minutes i saw a man drop through this trapdoor to the balcony and climb from there to the main floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he reached the floor he shouted fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next instant every person in the rink was up and a panic had started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was very sure there was no fire but i knew that many might be killed in the rush which was beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i sprang on a chair and shouted to the people with the full strength of there is no fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cooler persons in the crowd at once began to help in this calming process <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looked as if we had the situation in hand for the people hesitated and most of them grew quiet but just then a few words were hissed up to me that made my heart stop beating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a member of our local committee was standing beside my chair speaking there is a fire miss shaw he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gods the shock was so unexpected that my knees al most gave way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people were still standing wavering looking uncertainly toward us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i raised my voice again and if it sounded unnatural my hearers probably thought it was because i was speak ing so loudly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we are already standing i cried and are all nervous a little exercise will do us good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man who had whispered the warning jumped into the aisle and struck up jesus lover of my soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he led the march down to the door while the big audience swung into line and followed him joining in the song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remained on the chair beating time and talking to the people as they went but when the last of them had left the building i almost collapsed for the flames had begun to eat through the wooden walls and the clang of the fire engines was heard outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i was sure every one was safe however i experienced the most intense anger i had yet known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my indignation against the men who had risked hundreds of lives by setting fire to a crowded building made me see red it was clear that they must be taught a lesson then and there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i was outside the rink i called a meeting and the congre gational minister who was in the crowd lent us his church and led the way to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the audience followed us and we had a wonderful meeting dur ing which we were able at last to make clear to the people of that town the character of the liquor interests we were fighting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that episode did the temperance cause more good than a hundred ordinary meetings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men who had been indifferent before became our friends and supporters and at the fol lowing election we carried the town for prohibition by a big majority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there have been other occasions when our op ponents have not fought us fairly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once in an ohio town a group of politicians hearing that i was to lecture on temperance in the courthouse on a certain night took possession of the building early in the evening on the pretense of holding a meeting and held it against us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when escorted by a com mittee of leading women i reached the building and tried to enter we found that the men had locked us out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our audience was gathering and filling the street and we finally sent a courteous message to the men assuming that they had forgotten us and re minding them of our position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the messenger re ported that the men would leave about eight but that the room was black with smoke and filthy with tobaccojuice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we waited patiently until eight oclock holding little outside meetings in groups as our audience waited with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cullingworth wanted to have another one at the business place as much i think for his patients as his horses and in his audacious way he determined that he would build it himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so at it we went he i the coachman mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dug foundations got bricks in by the cartload made our own mortar and i think that we shall end by making a very fair job of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not quite as flatchested as we could wish and i think that if i were a horse inside it i should be careful about brushing against the walls but still it will keep the wind and rain out when it is finished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cullingworth talks of our building a new house for ourselves but as we have three large ones already there does not seem to be any pressing need <end> <end> 
<start> <start> talking about horses we had no end of a fuss here the other day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cullingworth got it into his head that he wanted a firstclass riding horse and as neither of the carriage ones would satisfy him he commissioned a horse dealer to get him one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man told us of a charger which one of the officers in the garrison was trying to get rid of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not conceal the fact that the reason why he wished to sell it was because he considered it to be dangerous but he added that captain lucas had given l for it and was prepared to sell it at seventy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this excited cullingworth and he ordered the creature to be saddled and brought round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a beautiful animal coal black with a magnificent neck and shoulders but with a nasty backward tilt to its ears and an unpleasant way of looking at you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the horse dealer said that our yard was too small to try the creature in but cullingworth clambered up upon its back and formally took possession of it by lamming it between the ears with the bone handle of his whip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then ensued one of the most lively ten minutes that i can remember <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beast justified his reputation but cullingworth although he was no horseman stuck to him like a limpet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> backwards forwards sideways on his fore feet on his hind feet with his back curved with his back sunk bucking and kicking there was nothing the creature did not try <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cullingworth was sitting alternately on his mane and on the root of his tailnever by any chance in the saddle he had lost both stirrups and his knees were drawn up and his heels dug into the creatures ribs while his hands clawed at mane saddle or ears whichever he saw in front of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kept his whip however and whenever the brute eased down cullingworth lammed him once more with the bone handle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his idea i suppose was to break its spirit but he had taken a larger contract than he could carry through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the animal bunched his four feet together ducked down his head arched his back like a yawning cat and gave three convulsive springs into the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the first cullingworths knees were above the saddle flaps at the second his ankles were retaining a convulsive grip at the third he flew forward like a stone out of a sling narrowly missed the coping of the wall broke with his head the iron bar which held some wire netting and toppled back with a thud into the yard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up he bounded with the blood streaming down his face and running into our halffinished stables he seized a hatchet and with a bellow of rage rushed at the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i caught him by the coat and put on a fourteenstone drag while the horse dealer who was as white as a cheese ran off with his horse into the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cullingworth broke away from my grip and cursing incoherently his face slobbered with blood and his hatchet waving over his head he rushed out of the yard the most diabolical looking ruffian you can imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however luckily for the dealer he had got a good start and cullingworth was persuaded to come back and wash his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we bound up his cut and found him little the worse except in his temper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for me he would most certainly have paid seventy pounds for his insane outburst of rage against the animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i daresay you think it strange that i should write so much about this fellow and so little about anybody else but the fact is that i know nobody else and that my whole circle is bounded by my patients cullingworth and his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my living with them brings the same taboo from my brother doctors upon my head although i have never done anything unprofessional myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who should i see in the street the other day but the mcfarlanes whom you will remember at linlithgow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was foolish enough to propose to maimie mcfarlane once and she was sensible enough to refuse me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i should have done had she accepted me i cant imagine for that was three years ago and i have more ties and less prospect of marriage now than then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well theres no use yearning for what you cant have and theres no other man living to whom i would speak about the matter at all but life is a deadly lonely thing when a man has no one on his side but himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why is it that i am sitting here in the moonlight writing to you except that i am craving for sympathy and fellowship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i get it from you tooas much as one friend ever got from anotherand yet there are some sides to my nature with which neither wife nor friend nor any one else can share <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you cut your own path you must expect to find yourself alone upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its nearly dawn and i as wakeful as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is chilly and i have draped a blanket round me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive heard that this is the favourite hour of the suicide and i see that ive been tailing off in the direction of melancholy myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me wind up on a lighter chord by quoting cullingworths latest article <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must tell you that he is still inflamed by the idea of his own paper and his brain is in full eruption sending out a perpetual stream of libellous paragraphs doggerel poems social skits parodies and articles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he brings them all to me and my table is already piled with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is his latest brought up to my room after he had undressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the outcome of some remarks i had made about the difficulty which our faroff descendants may have in determining what the meaning is of some of the commonest objects of our civilisation and as a corollary how careful we should be before we become dogmatic about the old romans or egyptians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the third annual meeting of the new guinea archaeological society a paper was read upon recent researches on the supposed site of london together with some observations upon hollow cylinders in use among the ancient londoners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several examples of these metallic cylinders or tubings were on exhibition in the hall and were passed round for inspection among the audience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the learned lecturer prefaced his remarks by observing that on account of the enormous interval of time which separated them from the days when london was a flourishing city it behoved them to be very guarded in any conclusions to which they might come as to the habits of the inhabitants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> recent research appeared to have satisfactorily established the fact that the date of the final fall of london was somewhat later than that of the erection of the egyptian pyramids <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a large building had recently been unearthed near the driedup bed of the river thames and there could be no question from existing records that this was the seat of the lawmaking council among the ancient britonsor anglicans as they were sometimes called <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lecturer proceeded to point out that the bed of the thames had been tunnelled under by a monarch named brunel who is supposed by some authorities to have succeeded alfred the great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the open spaces of london he went on to remark must have been far from safe as the bones of lions tigers and other extinct forms of carnivora had been discovered in the regents park <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having briefly referred to the mysterious structures known as pillarboxes which are scattered thickly over the city and which are either religious in their origin or else may be taken as marking the tombs of anglican chiefs the lecturer passed on to the cylindrical piping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this had been explained by the patagonian school as being a universal system of lightningconductors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he the lecturer could not assent to this theory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a series of observations extending over several months he had discovered the important fact that these lines of tubing if followed out invariably led to large hollow metallic reservoirs which were connected with furnaces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one who knew how addicted the ancient britons were to the use of tobacco could doubt what this meant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently large quantities of the herb were burned in the central chamber and the aromatic and narcotic vapour was carried through the tubes to the house of every citizen so that he might inhale it at will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never seen one like it on a violin that can scarcely be for i do not remember of signor diotti telling me there was anything unusual about his and i am equally sure the string can be of no importance or angelo would have told me of it mildred quickly rejoined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i recall a strange story of paganini continued the old man apparently not noticing her interruption he became infatuated with a lady of high rank who was insensible of the admiration he had for her beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he composed a love scene for two strings the e and g the first was to personate the lady the second himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it commenced with a species of dialogue intending to represent her indifference and his passion now sportive now sad laughter on her part and tears from him ending in an apotheosis of loving reconciliation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it affected the lady to that degree that ever after she and no doubt they were happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the old man with assumed sentiment even when his profession called him far away for she had made him promise her he never would play upon the two strings whose music had won her heart so those strings were the old man puffed away in silence for a moment then with logical directness continued perhaps the string thats mute upon diottis violin is mute nonsense said the girl half impatiently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the string is black and glossy as the tresses that fall in tangled skeins on the shoulders of the dreamy beauties of tuscany <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be an idle fancy but if that string is not a woven strand from some womans crowning glory then i you are jesting uncle she replied but her heart was heavy already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ask him to play on that string ill wager hell refuse said the old man contemptuously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will not refuse when i ask him but i will not tonight answered the unhappy girl with forced determina tion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then taking the old mans hands she said goodnight i am going to my room please make my excuses to signor diotti and father and wearily she ascended the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little house was scrubbed and cleaned until it shone again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louisette had looked her dainty little dress over and over to be sure that there was not a flaw to be found wherein sylves could compare her unfavourably to the stylish chicago girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train rumbled in on the platform and two pair of eyes opened wide for the first glimpse of sylves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the porter all officiousness and brass buttons bustled up to maam mouton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there appeared joseph lascaud then some men bearing something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louisette put her hands up to her eyes to hide the sight but maam mouton was rigid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was too cold for him joseph was saying to almost deaf ears and he took the consumption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought he could get well when he come home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he talk all the way down about the bayou and about you and louisette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just three hours ago he had a bad hemorrhage and he died from weakness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said he wanted to get home and give louisette her diamond ring when the bayou overflowed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might have had another name we never knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baptiste long ago in the dim past and it sufficed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one had ever been known who had the temerity to ask him for another cognomen for though he was a mildmannered little man he had an uncomfortable way of shutting up oysterwise and looking disagreeable when approached concerning his personal history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was small most creole men are small when they are old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be that age withers them sooner and more effectually than those of unlatinised extraction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baptiste was furthermore very much wrinkled and lame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the son of man he had nowhere to lay his head save when some kindly family made room for him in a garret or a barn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he subsisted by doing odd jobs whitewashing cleaning yards doing errands and the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little old man was a frequenter of the levee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never a day passed that his quaint little figure was not seen moving up and down about the ships <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chiefly did he haunt the texas and pacific warehouses and the landingplace of the morganline steamships <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this seemed like madness for these spots are almost the busiest on the levee and the rough seamen and longshoremen have least time to be bothered with small weak folks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still there was method in the madness of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morgan steamships as every one knows ply between new orleans and central and south american ports doing the major part of the fruit trade and many were the baskets of forgotten fruit that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have more faith he said i ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison and the other was entirely harmless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to have known that before ever i saw the box at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this seems strange to you continued holmes because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outre and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had the effect of making it less so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gregson who had listened to this address with considerable impatience could contain himself no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sherlock holmes he said we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man and that you have your own methods of working <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we want something more than mere theory and preaching now though <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a case of taking the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have made my case out and it seems i was wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lestrade went after his man stangerson and it appears that he was wrong too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have thrown out hints here and hints there and seem to know more than we do but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you name the man who did it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot help feeling that gregson is right sir remarked lestrade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have both tried and we have both failed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have remarked more than once since i have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely you will not withhold it any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any delay in arresting the assassin i observed might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus pressed by us all holmes showed signs of irresolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down as was his habit when lost in thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there will be no more murders he said at last stopping abruptly and facing us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can put that consideration out of the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have asked me if i know the name of the assassin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mere knowing of his name is a small thing however compared with the power of laying our hands upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements but it is a thing which needs delicate handling for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with who is supported as i have had occasion to prove by another who is as clever as himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him but if he had the slightest suspicion he would change his name and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without meaning to hurt either of your feelings i am bound to say that i consider these men to be more than a match for the official force and that is why i have not asked your assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i fail i shall of course incur all the blame due to this omission but that i am prepared for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at present i am ready to promise that the instant that i can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations i shall do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gregson and lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair while the others beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither of them had time to speak however before there was a tap at the door and the spokesman of the street arabs young wiggins introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the seats were at the end of a row one above the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charity had taken off her hat to have an uninterrupted view and whenever she leaned back to follow the curve of some dishevelled rocket she could feel harneys knees against her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a longer interval of darkness followed and then the whole night broke into flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from every point of the horizon gold and silver arches sprang up and crossed each other skyorchards broke into blossom shed their flaming petals and hung their branches with golden fruit and all the while the air was filled with a soft supernatural hum as though great birds were building their nests in those invisible treetops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then there came a lull and a wave of moonlight swept the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a flash it revealed hundreds of boats steeldark against lustrous ripples then it withdrew as if with a furling of vast translucent wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as if all the latent beauty of things had been unveiled to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could not imagine that the world held anything more wonderful but near her she heard someone say you wait till you see the set piece and instantly her hopes took a fresh flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last just as it was beginning to seem as though the whole arch of the sky were one great lid pressed against her dazzled eyeballs and striking out of them continuous jets of jewelled light the velvet darkness settled down again and a murmur of expectation ran through the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same voice said excitedly and charity grasping the hat on her knee crushed it tight in the effort to restrain her rapture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment the night seemed to grow more impenetrably black then a great picture stood out against it like a constellation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was surmounted by a golden scroll bearing the inscription washington crossing the delaware and across a flood of motionless golden ripples the national hero passed erect solemn and gigantic standing with folded arms in the stern of a slowly moving golden boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a long ohhh burst from the spectators the stand creaked and shook with their blissful trepidations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ohhh charity gasped she had forgotten where she was had at last forgotten even harneys nearness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to have been caught up into the stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the obscurity she felt her head clasped by two hands her face was drawn backward and harneys lips were pressed on hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with sudden vehemence he wound his arms about her holding her head against his breast while she gave him back his kisses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an unknown harney had revealed himself a harney who dominated her and yet over whom she felt herself possessed of a new mysterious power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the crowd was beginning to move and he had to release her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he scrambled over the side of the stand and holding up his arm caught her as she sprang to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he passed his arm about her waist steadying her against the descending rush of people and she clung to him speechless exultant as if all the crowding and confusion about them were a mere vain stirring of the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come he repeated we must try to make the trolley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew her along and she followed still in her dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they walked as if they were one so isolated in ecstasy that the people jostling them on every side seemed impalpable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when they reached the terminus the illuminated trolley was already clanging on its way its platforms black with passengers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cars waiting behind it were as thickly packed and the throng about the terminus was so dense that it seemed hopeless to struggle for a place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last trip up the lake a megaphone bellowed from the wharf and the lights of the little steamboat came dancing out of the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no use waiting here shall we run up the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they pushed their way back to the edge of the water just as the gangplank lowered from the white side of the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the electric light at the end of the wharf flashed full on the descending passengers and among them charity caught sight of julia hawes her white feather askew and the face under it flushed with coarse laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she stepped from the gangplank she stopped short her darkringed eyes darting malice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she called out and then looking back over her shoulder didnt i tell you it was a family party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres grandpas little daughter come to take him home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a snigger ran through the group and then towering above them and steadying himself by the handrail in a desperate effort at erectness mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the young men of the party he wore a secret society emblem in the buttonhole of his black frockcoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his head was covered by a new panama hat and his narrow black tie half undone dangled down on his rumpled shirtfront <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face a livid brown with red blotches of anger and lips sunken in like an old mans was a lamentable ruin in the searching glare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was just behind julia hawes and had one hand on her arm but as he left the gangplank he freed himself and moved a step or two away from his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seen charity at once and his glance passed slowly from her to harney whose arm was still about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood staring at them and trying to master the senile quiver of his lips then he drew himself up with the tremulous majesty of drunkenness and stretched out his arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a scream of tipsy laughter from the party and charity involuntarily put her hands to her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every act of hiring or working every act of buying or selling or delivering or causing anything to be bought or sold is specifically made a separate offence mark the effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a party a man and his wife and children enter a tea garden and the informer stations himself in the next box from whence he can see and hear everything that passes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> away runs the waiter to the bar and gets the ale from the landlord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out comes the informers notebook penalty on the father for hiring on the waiter for delivering and on the landlord for selling on the lords day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the waiter delivers the ale and darts off little suspecting the penalties in store for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just get this little boy a biscuit will you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that draws the blood from your head she would say to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me stories while mending the linen with her long crooked nimble fingers behind her magnifying spectacles for age had impaired her sight her eyes appeared enormous to me strangely profound double <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as far as i can remember from the things which she told me and by which my childish heart was moved she had the large heart of a poor woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me what had happened in the village how a cow had escaped from the cowhouse and had been found the next morning in front of prosper malets mill looking at the sails turning or about a hens egg which had been found in the church belfry without anyone being able to understand what creature had been there to lay it or the queer story of jean pilas dog who had gone ten leagues to bring back his masters breeches which a tramp had stolen while they were hanging up to dry out of doors after he had been caught in the rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me these simple adventures in such a manner that in my mind they assumed the proportions of nevertobeforgotten dramas of grand and mysterious poems and the ingenious stories invented by the poets which my mother told me in the evening had none of the flavor none of the fullness or of the vigor of the peasant womans narratives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well one thursday when i had spent all the morning in listening to mother clochette i wanted to go upstairs to her again during the day after picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on opening the door of the linenroom i saw the old seamstress lying on the floor by the side of her chair her face turned down and her arms stretched out but still holding her needle in one hand and one of my shirts in the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of her legs in a blue stocking the longer one no doubt was extended under her chair and her spectacles glistened by the wall where they had rolled away from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all came running and in a few minutes i was told that mother clochette was dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot describe the profound poignant terrible emotion which stirred my childish heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went slowly down into the drawingroom and hid myself in a dark corner in the depths of a great old armchair where i knelt and wept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remained there for a long time no doubt for night came on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly some one came in with a lampwithout seeing me howeverand i heard my father and mother talking with the medical man whose voice i recognized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been sent for immediately and he was explaining the cause of the accident of which i understood nothing however <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he sat down and had a glass of liqueur and a biscuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went on talking and what he then said will remain engraved on my mind until i die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think that i can give the exact words which he used <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she broke her leg the day of my arrival here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not even had time to wash my hands after getting off the diligence before i was sent for in all haste for it was a bad case very bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was seventeen and a pretty girl very pretty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never told her story before in fact no one but myself and one other person who is no longer living in this part of the country ever knew it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that she is dead i may be less discreet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a young assistant teacher had just come to live in the village he was goodlooking and had the bearing of a soldier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the girls ran after him but he was disdainful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides that he was very much afraid of his superior the schoolmaster old grabu who occasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old grabu already employed pretty hortense who has just died here and who was afterward nicknamed clochette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the assistant master singled out the pretty young girl who was no doubt flattered at being chosen by this disdainful conqueror at any rate she fell in love with him and he succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the hayloft behind the school at night after she had done her days sewing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she pretended to go home but instead of going downstairs when she left the grabus she went upstairs and hid among the hay to wait for her lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he soon joined her and he was beginning to say pretty things to her when the door of the hayloft opened and the schoolmaster appeared and asked what are you doing up there sigisbert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> feeling sure that he would be caught the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and replied stupidly i came up here to rest a little among the bundles of the loft was very large and absolutely dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sigisbert pushed the frightened girl to the further end and said go there and hide yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall lose my situation so get away and hide when the schoolmaster heard the whispering he continued why i will soon find out the old man replied and doublelocking the door he went down to get a light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the young man who was a coward such as one sometimes meets lost his head and he repeated having grown furious all of a sudden hide yourself so that he may not find you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will deprive me of my bread for my whole life you will ruin my they could hear the key turning in the lock again and hortense ran to the window which looked out on to the street opened it quickly and then in a low and determined voice said you will come and pick me up when he is gone and she jumped out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old grabu found nobody and went down again in great surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a quarter of an hour later monsieur sigisbert came to me and related his adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl had remained at the foot of the wall unable to get up as she had fallen from the second story and i went with him to fetch her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was raining in torrents and i brought the unfortunate girl home with me for the right leg was broken in three places and the bones had come out through the flesh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not complain and merely said with admirable i sent for assistance and for the workgirls friends and told them a madeup story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and lamed her outside my door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they believed me and the gendarmes for a whole month tried in vain to find the author of this accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i say that this woman was a heroine and had the fiber of those who accomplish the grandest deeds in history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was her only love affair and she died a virgin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a martyr a noble soul a sublimely devoted woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i did not absolutely admire her i should not have told you this story which i would never tell anyone during her life you understand why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor ceased mamma cried and papa said some words which i did not catch then they left the room and i remained on my knees in the armchair and sobbed while i heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps and something knocking against the side of the staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going to write down at last what has happened to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing is so bizarre so inexplicable so incomprehensible so silly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were not perfectly sure of what i have seen sure that there was not in my reasoning any defect any error in my declarations any lacuna in the inflexible sequence of my observations i should believe myself to be the dupe of a simple hallucination the sport of a singular vision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesterday i was in a private asylum but i went there voluntarily out of prudence and fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only one single human being knows my history and that is the doctor of the said asylum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yea i feel as though weighed down by an intolerable nightmare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have always been a recluse a dreamer a kind of isolated philosopher easygoing content with but little harboring illfeeling against no man and without even a grudge against heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have constantly lived alone consequently a kind of torture takes hold of me when i find myself in the presence of others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not averse to going out into the world to conversation to dining with friends but when they are near me for any length of time even the most intimate of them they bore me fatigue me enervate me and i experience an overwhelming torturing desire to see them get up and go to take themselves away and to leave me by myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall not give you my answer now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forget that you have asked me to be your wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us go on as we have beenthen i can consider you from an entirely different angle for a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be that i shall discover that my feeling for you is more than friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i certainly have not thought for a moment that i loved you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this arrangement was perfectly satisfactory to monsieur thuran <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he deeply regretted that he had been hasty but he had loved her for so long a time and so devotedly that he thought that every one must know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the first time i saw you hazel he said i have loved you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am willing to wait for i am certain that so great and pure a love as mine will be rewarded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that i care to know is that you do not love another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never been in love in my life she replied and he was quite satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the way home that night he purchased a steam yacht and built a milliondollar villa on the black sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day hazel strong enjoyed one of the happiest surprises of her lifeshe ran face to face upon jane porter as she was coming out of a jewelers shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where in the world did you drop from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here i have been wasting whole reams of perfectly good imagination picturing you in baltimorethe very idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she threw her arms about her friend once more and kissed her a dozen times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time mutual explanations had been made hazel knew that lord tenningtons yacht had put in at cape town for at least a weeks stay and at the end of that time was to continue on her voyagethis time up the west coastand so back to england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where concluded jane i am to be married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not yet replied jane and then quite irrelevantly i wish england were a million miles from here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> visits were exchanged between the yacht and hazels relatives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dinners were arranged and trips into the surrounding country to entertain the visitors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur thuran was a welcome guest at every function <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave a dinner himself to the men of the party and managed to ingratiate himself in the good will of lord tennington by many little acts of hospitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur thuran had heard dropped a hint of something which might result from this unexpected visit of lord tenningtons yacht and he wanted to be counted in on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once when he was alone with the englishman he took occasion to make it quite plain that his engagement to miss strong was to be announced immediately upon their return to america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not a word of it my dear tenningtonnot a word of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly i quite understand my dear fellow tennington had replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you are to be congratulatedripping girl dont you knowreally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strong hazel and monsieur thuran were lord tenningtons guests aboard his yacht <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strong had been telling them how much she had enjoyed her visit at cape town and that she regretted that a letter just received from her attorneys in baltimore had necessitated her cutting her visit shorter than they had intended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first of the week i think she replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i too have found that i must return at once and now i shall have the honor of accompanying and serving you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is nice of you monsieur thuran replied mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure that we shall be glad to place ourselves under your protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the bottom of her heart was the wish that they might escape him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes tennington of course ventured clayton it must be a bully idea if you had it but what the deuce is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goin to steam to china via the south pole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i say now clayton returned tennington you neednt be so rough on a fellow just because you didnt happen to suggest this trip yourselfyouve acted a regular bounder ever since we sailed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sir he continued its a bully idea and youll all say so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strong and miss strong and thuran too if hell come as far as england with us on the yacht <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it certainly is a corking ideai never should have suspected you of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and well sail the first of the week or any other time that suits your convenience mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strong concluded the bighearted englishman as though the thing were all arranged except the sailing date <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mercy lord tennington you havent even given us an opportunity to thank you much less decide whether we shall be able to accept your generous invitation said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well make as good time as any passenger boat and youll be fully as comfortable and anyway we all want you and wont take no for an answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it was settled that they should sail the following monday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two days out the girls were sitting in hazels cabin looking at some prints she had had finished in cape town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they represented all the pictures she had taken since she had left america and the girls were both engrossed in them jane asking many questions and hazel keeping up a perfect torrent of comment and explanation of the various scenes and people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here she said suddenly heres a man you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor fellow i have so often intended asking you about him but i never have been able to think of it when we were together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was holding the little print so that jane did not see the face of the man it portrayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that he met you in america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not recollect the name replied jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor fellow was lost overboard on our trip down the coast she said as she handed the print to jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lost overwhy hazel hazeldont tell me that he is deaddrowned at sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont you say that you are joking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and before the astonished miss strong could catch her jane porter had slipped to the floor in a swoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after hazel had restored her chum to consciousness she sat looking at her for a long time before either spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not know jane said hazel in a constrained voice that you knew mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caldwell so intimately that his death could prove such a shock to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do not mean to tell me that you do not know who this man was hazel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why yes jane i know perfectly well who he washis name was john caldwell he was from london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh hazel i wish i could believe it moaned the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could believe it but those features are burned so deep into my memory and my heart that i should recognize them anywhere in the world from among a thousand others who might appear identical to any one but me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know that that is a picture of tarzan of the apes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh hazel are you sure that he is dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid not dear answered hazel sadly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could think that you are mistaken but now a hundred and one little pieces of corroborative evidence occur to me that meant nothing to me while i thought that he was john caldwell of london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that he had been born in africa and educated in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes that would be true murmured jane porter dully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first officer who searched his luggage found nothing to identify john caldwell of london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> practically all his belongings had been made or purchased in paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything that bore an initial was marked either with a t alone or with j <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we thought that he was traveling incognito under his first two namesthe j <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan of the apes took the name jean c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan said jane in the same lifeless monotone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he died all alone in this terrible ocean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is unbelievable that that brave heart should have ceased to beatthat those mighty muscles are quiet and cold forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was all he could do in the cruel jungle for the man who had given his life in the service of his little son and his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tarzan took up again the pursuit of rokoff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that he was positive that the woman ahead of him was indeed jane and that she had again fallen into the hands of the russian it seemed that with all the incredible speed of his fleet and agile muscles he moved at but a snails pace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with difficulty that he kept the trail for there were many paths through the jungle at this pointcrossing and crisscrossing forking and branching in all directions and over them all had passed natives innumerable coming and going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spoor of the white men was obliterated by that of the native carriers who had followed them and over all was the spoor of other natives and of wild beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was most perplexing yet tarzan kept on assiduously checking his sense of sight against his sense of smell that he might more surely keep to the right trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but with all his care night found him at a point where he was positive that he was on the wrong trail entirely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that the pack would follow his spoor and so he had been careful to make it as distinct as possible brushing often against the vines and creepers that walled the jungle path and in other ways leaving his scentspoor plainly discernible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as darkness settled a heavy rain set in and there was nothing for the baffled apeman to do but wait in the partial shelter of a huge tree until morning but the coming of dawn brought no cessation of the torrential downpour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a week the sun was obscured by heavy clouds while violent rain and wind storms obliterated the last remnants of the spoor tarzan constantly though vainly sought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during all this time he saw no signs of natives nor of his own pack the members of which he feared had lost his trail during the terrific storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the country was strange to him he had been unable to judge his course accurately since he had had neither sun by day nor moon nor stars by night to guide him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the sun at last broke through the clouds in the fore noon of the seventh day it looked down upon an almost frantic apeman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time in his life tarzan of the apes had been lost in the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that the experience should have befallen him at such a time seemed cruel beyond expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somewhere in this savage land his wife and son lay in the clutches of the archfiend rokoff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what hideous trials might they not have undergone during those seven awful days that nature had thwarted him in his endeavours to locate them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan knew the russian in whose power they were so well that he could not doubt but that the man filled with rage that jane had once escaped him and knowing that tarzan might be close upon his trail would wreak without further loss of time whatever vengeance his polluted mind might be able to conceive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now that the sun shone once more the apeman was still at a loss as to what direction to take <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that rokoff had left the river in pursuit of anderssen but whether he would continue inland or return to the ugambi was a question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the apeman had seen that the river at the point he had left it was growing narrow and swift so that he judged that it could not be navigable even for canoes to any great distance farther toward its source <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however if rokoff had not returned to the river in what direction had he proceeded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the direction of anderssens flight with jane and the child tarzan was convinced that the man had purposed attempting the tremendous feat of crossing the continent to zanzibar but whether rokoff would dare so dangerous a journey or not was a question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fear might drive him to the attempt now that he knew the manner of horrible pack that was upon his trail and that tarzan of the apes was following him to wreak upon him the vengeance that he deserved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the apeman determined to continue toward the northeast in the general direction of german east africa until he came upon natives from whom he might gain information as to rokoffs whereabouts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second day following the cessation of the rain tarzan came upon a native village the inhabitants of which fled into the bush the instant their eyes fell upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan not to be thwarted in any such manner as this pursued them and after a brief chase caught up with a young warrior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fellow was so badly frightened that he was unable to defend himself dropping his weapons and falling upon the ground wideeyed and screaming as he gazed on his captor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with considerable difficulty that the apeman quieted the fellows fears sufficiently to obtain a coherent statement from him as to the cause of his uncalledfor terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from him tarzan learned by dint of much coaxing that a party of whites had passed through the village several days before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these men had told them of a terrible white devil that pursued them warning the natives against it and the frightful pack of demons that accompanied it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the black had recognized tarzan as the white devil from the descriptions given by the whites and their black servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind him he had expected to see a horde of demons disguised as apes and panthers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this tarzan saw the cunning hand of rokoff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the russian was attempting to make travel as difficult as possible for him by turning the natives against him in superstitious fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the native further told tarzan that the white man who had led the recent expedition had promised them a fabulous reward if they would kill the white devil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this they had fully intended doing should the opportunity present itself but the moment they had seen tarzan their blood had turned to water as the porters of the white men had told them would be the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finding the apeman made no attempt to harm him the native at last recovered his grasp upon his courage and at tarzans suggestion accompanied the white devil back to the village calling as he went for his fellows to return also as the white devil has promised to do you no harm if you come back right away and answer his questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one by one the blacks straggled into the village but that their fears were not entirely allayed was evident from the amount of white that showed about the eyes of the majority of them as they cast constant and apprehensive sidelong glances at the apeman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from her speech she was evidently an arab girl but he had never before seen one thus clothed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> korak and i live in the jungle alone since aht went to be king of the apes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had always thus pronounced akuts name for so it had sounded to her when first she came with korak and the ape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> korak could have been kind but he would not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mm was the strangers only oral comment upon this startling announcement but what he thought might have been partially interpreted through the pitying light that entered his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he approached the girl and started to lay his hand upon her forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she drew back with a savage little growl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only wish to discover if you have feverif you are entirely well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are we will set forth in search of korak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meriem looked straight into the keen gray eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must have found there an unquestionable assurance of the honorableness of their owner for she permitted him to lay his palm upon her forehead and feel her pulse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since i was a little girl many many years ago and korak came and took me from my father who was beating me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since then i have lived in the trees with korak and aht <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meriem pointed with a sweep of her hand that took in generously half the continent of africa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could you find your way back to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know she replied but he will find his way to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i have a plan said the stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i live but a few marches from here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall take you home where my wife will look after you and care for you until we can find korak or korak finds us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he could find you here he can find you at my village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meriem thought that it was so but she did not like the idea of not starting immediately back to meet korak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the other hand the man had no intention of permitting this poor insane child to wander further amidst the dangers of the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from whence she had come or what she had undergone he could not guess but that her korak and their life among the apes was but a figment of a disordered mind he could not doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew the jungle well and he knew that men have lived alone and naked among the savage beasts for years but a frail and slender girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malbihns boys were striking camp in preparation for a hasty departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malbihn stood at a distance angry and glowering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stranger approached one of his own men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> find out where they got this girl he commanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the negro thus addressed questioned one of malbihns followers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they bought her from old kovudoo he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is all that this fellow will tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pretends that he knows nothing more and i guess that he does not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these two white men were very bad men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did many things that their boys knew not the meanings of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be well bwana to kill the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish that i might but a new law is come into this part of the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not as it was in the old days muviri replied the master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stranger remained until malbihn and his safari had disappeared into the jungle toward the north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meriem trustful now stood at his side geeka clutched in one slim brown hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they talked together the man wondering at the faltering arabic of the girl but attributing it finally to her defective mentality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could he have known that years had elapsed since she had used it until she was taken by the swedes he would not have wondered that she had half forgotten it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was yet another reason why the language of the sheik had thus readily eluded her but of that reason she herself could not have guessed the truth any better than could the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to persuade her to return with him to his village as he called it or douar in arabic but she was insistent upon searching immediately for korak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a last resort he determined to take her with him by force rather than sacrifice her life to the insane hallucination which haunted her but being a wise man he determined to humor her first and then attempt to lead her as he would have her go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so when they took up their march it was in the direction of the south though his own ranch lay almost due east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees he turned the direction of their way more and more eastward and greatly was he pleased to note that the girl failed to discover that any change was being made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first she had had but her intuition to guide her belief that this big tarmangani meant her no harm but as the days passed and she saw that his kindness and consideration never faltered she came to compare him with korak and to be very fond of him but never did her loyalty to her apeman flag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the fifth day they came suddenly upon a great plain and from the edge of the forest the girl saw in the distance fenced fields and many buildings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sight she drew back in astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could not find korak replied the man and as our way led near my douar i have brought you here to wait and rest with my wife until my men can find your ape or he finds you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will be safer with us and you will be happier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in thy douar they will beat me as did the sheik my father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not think to look for me in the douar of a white man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one will beat you child replied the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wife will be very good to you and at last korak will come for i shall send men to search for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not bring him for he would kill them as all men have tried to kill him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do not know the way to your own country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the leopards or the lions would get you the first night and after all you would not find your korak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is better that you stay with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did i not save you from the bad man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you not owe me something for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then remain with us for a few weeks at least until we can determine what is best for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are only a little girlit would be wicked to permit you to go alone into the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jungle she said is my father and my mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has been kinder to me than have men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor am i afraid of the leopard or the lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be that a leopard or a lion shall kill me or it may be a tiny bug no bigger than the end of my littlest finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the lion leaps upon me or the little bug stings me i shall be afraidoh then i shall be terribly afraid i know but life would be very miserable indeed were i to spend it in terror of the thing that has not yet happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it be the lion my terror shall be short of life but if it be the little bug i may suffer for days before i die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so i fear the lion least of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can hear him or see him or smell him in time to escape but any moment i may place a hand or foot on the little bug and never know that he is there until i feel his deadly sting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should rather die than leave it forever but your douar is close beside the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will do as you wish and remain here for a while to wait the coming of my korak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the man and he led the way down toward the flowercovered bungalow behind which lay the barns and out houses of a wellordered african farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they came nearer a dozen dogs ran barking toward them gaunt wolf hounds a huge great dane a nimblefooted collie and a number of yapping quarrelsome fox terriers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first their appearance was savage and unfriendly in the extreme but once they recognized the foremost black warriors and the white man behind them their attitude underwent a remarkable change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the collie and the fox terriers became frantic with delirious joy and while the wolf hounds and the great dane were not a whit less delighted at the return of their master their greetings were of a more dignified nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each in turn sniffed at meriem who displayed not the slightest fear of any of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the moment that he had first laid eyes upon jane clayton he had nursed within his breast a secret passion for the beautiful american wife of the english lord and when achmet zeks discovery of the jewels had necessitated flight the belgian had dreamed in his planning of a future in which he might convince lady greystoke that her husband was dead and by playing upon her gratitude win her for himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that part of the village farthest from the gates werper discovered that two or three long poles taken from a nearby pile which had been collected for the construction of huts had been leaned against the top of the palisade forming a precarious though not impossible avenue of escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rightly he inferred that thus had lady greystoke found the means to scale the wall nor did he lose even a moment in following her lead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once in the jungle he struck out directly eastward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few miles south of him jane clayton lay panting among the branches of a tree in which she had taken refuge from a prowling and hungry lioness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her escape from the village had been much easier than she had anticipated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the knife which she had used to cut her way through the brush wall of the hut to freedom she had found sticking in the wall of her prison doubtless left there by accident when a former tenant had vacated the premises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to cross the rear of the village keeping always in the densest shadows had required but a few moments and the fortunate circumstance of the discovery of the hut poles lying so near the palisade had solved for her the problem of the passage of the high wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an hour she had followed the old game trail toward the south until there fell upon her trained hearing the stealthy padding of a stalking beast behind her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nearest tree gave her instant sanctuary for she was too wise in the ways of the jungle to chance her safety for a moment after discovering that she was being hunted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> werper with better success traveled slowly onward until dawn when to his chagrin he discovered a mounted arab upon his trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was one of achmet zeks minions many of whom were scattered in all directions through the forest searching for the fugitive belgian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane claytons escape had not yet been discovered when achmet zek and his searchers set forth to overhaul werper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only man who had seen the belgian after his departure from his tent was the black sentry before the doorway of lady greystokes prison hut and he had been silenced by the discovery of the dead body of the man who had relieved him the sentry that mugambi had dispatched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bribe taker naturally inferred that werper had slain his fellow and dared not admit that he had permitted him to enter the hut fearing as he did the anger of achmet zek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so as chance directed that he should be the one to discover the body of the sentry when the first alarm had been given following achmet zeks discovery that werper had outwitted him the crafty black had dragged the dead body to the interior of a nearby tent and himself resumed his station before the doorway of the hut in which he still believed the woman to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the discovery of the arab close behind him the belgian hid in the foliage of a leafy bush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the trail ran straight for a considerable distance and down the shady forest aisle beneath the overarching branches of the trees rode the whiterobed figure of the pursuer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> werper crouched closer to the ground behind the leaves of his hiding place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no wind to stir the foliage in the depths of the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the mind of the belgian only the presence of a sinister and malevolent force could account for the phenomenon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mans eyes bored steadily into the screen of leaves upon the opposite side of the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gradually a form took shape beyond thema tawny form grim and terrible with yellowgreen eyes glaring fearsomely across the narrow trail straight into his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> werper could have screamed in fright but up the trail was coming the messenger of another death equally sure and no less terrible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across the trail from werper the lion crouched for the spring when suddenly his attention was attracted toward the horseman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the belgian saw the massive head turn in the direction of the raider and his heart all but ceased its beating as he awaited the result of this interruption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would the nervous animal he rode take fright at the odor of the carnivore and bolting leave werper still to the mercies of the king of beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he seemed unmindful of the near presence of the great cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on he came his neck arched champing at the bit between his teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the belgian turned his eyes again toward the lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beasts whole attention now seemed riveted upon the horseman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were abreast the lion now and still the brute did not spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could he be but waiting for them to pass before returning his attention to the original prey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same instant the lion sprang from his place of concealment full upon the mounted man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the horse with a shrill neigh of terror shrank sideways almost upon the belgian the lion dragged the helpless arab from his saddle and the horse leaped back into the trail and fled away toward the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the frightened beast had pressed in upon him werper had not been slow to note the quickly emptied saddle and the opportunity it presented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarcely had the lion dragged the arab down from one side than the belgian seizing the pommel of the saddle and the horses mane leaped upon the horses back from the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a half hour later a naked giant swinging easily through the lower branches of the trees paused and with raised head and dilating nostrils sniffed the morning air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the smell of blood fell strong upon his senses and mingled with it was the scent of numa the lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the giant cocked his head upon one side and listened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from a short distance up the trail came the unmistakable noises of the greedy feeding of a lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crunching of bones the gulping of great pieces the contented growling all attested the nearness of the king at table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan approached the spot still keeping to the branches of the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made no effort to conceal his approach and presently he had evidence that numa had heard him from the ominous rumbling warning that broke from a thicket beside the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> halting upon a low branch just above the lion tarzan looked down upon the grisly scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could this unrecognizable thing be the man he had been trailing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go to collect the ten fat goats the new sleeping mat and the two pieces of copper wire that your mother will pay for the medicine i shall make to bring you back to her he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there and he pointed toward the passage which they had followed to the chamber i will leave the hyenas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you try to escape they will eat you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cast aside the stick and called to the beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came snarling and slinking their tails between their legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bukawai led them to the passage and drove them into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he dragged a rude lattice into place before the opening after he himself had left the chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this will keep them from you he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i do not get the ten fat goats and the other things they shall at least have a few bones after i am through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he left the boy to think over the meaning of his when he was gone tibo threw himself upon the earth floor and broke into childish sobs of terror and loneliness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that his mother had no ten fat goats to give and that when bukawai returned little tibo would be killed and eaten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long he lay there he did not know but presently he was aroused by the growling of the hyenas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had returned through the passage and were glaring at him from beyond the lattice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could see their yellow eyes blazing through the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they reared up and clawed at the barrier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tibo shivered and withdrew to the opposite side of the chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the lattice sag and sway to the attacks of the beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> momentarily he expected that it would fall inward wearily the horrorridden hours dragged their slow way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> night came and for a time tibo slept but it seemed that the hungry beasts never slept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> always they stood just beyond the lattice growling their hideous growls or laughing their hideous laughs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the narrow rift in the rocky roof above him tibo could see a few stars and once the moon crossed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tibo was very hungry and thirsty for he had not eaten since the morning before and only once upon the long march had he been permitted to drink but even hunger and thirst it was after daylight that the child discovered a second opening in the walls of the subterranean chamber almost opposite that at which the hyenas still stood glaring hungrily at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only a narrow slit in the rocky wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might lead in but a few feet or it might lead to freedom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he extended his arm into the blackness but he dared not venture farther <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bukawai never would have left open a way of escape tibo reasoned so this passage must lead either nowhere to the boys fear of the actual dangers which menaced himbukawai and the two hyenashis superstition added countless others quite too horrible even to name for in the lives of the blacks through the shadows of the jungle day and the black horrors of the jungle night flit strange fantastic shapes peopling the already hideously peopled forests with menacing figures as though the lion and the leopard the snake and the hyena and the countless poisonous insects were not quite sufficient to strike terror to the hearts of the poor simple creatures whose lot is cast in earths most fearsome spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it was that little tibo cringed not only from real menaces but from imaginary ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was afraid even to venture upon a road that might lead to escape lest bukawai had set to watch it some frightful demon but the real menaces suddenly drove the imaginary ones from the boys mind for with the coming of daylight the halffamished hyenas renewed their efforts to break down the frail barrier which kept them from their prey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rearing upon their hind feet they clawed and struck at the lattice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with wide eyes tibo saw it sag and rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not for long he knew could it withstand the assaults of these two powerful and determined brutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already one corner had been forced past the rocky protuberance of the entrance way which had held it in place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tibo trembled as with ague backing against the farther wall he stood flattened out as far from the beasts as he could get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw a savage snarling head forced past it and grinning jaws snapping and gaping toward him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in another instant the pitiful fabric would fall inward and the two would be upon him rending his flesh from his bones gnawing the bones themselves fighting for bukawai came upon momaya outside the palisade of mbonga the chief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sight of him the woman drew back in revulsion then she flew at him tooth and nail but bukawai where is my baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what should i know of him other than that i rescued him from the white god of the jungle and have not yet received my pay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i come for the goats and the sleeping mat and the piece o
