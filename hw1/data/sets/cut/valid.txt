<start> <start> another moment brought the professor within the sphere of the friendly grip and he too was drawn upward to safety just as the baffled numa with a roar leaped to recover his vanishing quarry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment the two men clung panting to the great branch while tarzan squatted with his back to the stem of the tree watching them with mingled curiosity and amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the professor who first broke the silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander that you should have evinced such a paucity of manly courage in the presence of one of the lower orders and by your crass timidity have caused me to exert myself to such an unaccustomed degree in order that i might resume my discourse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander when you interrupted me the moors professor archimedes q <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander in icy tones the time has arrived when patience becomes a crime and mayhem appears garbed in the mantle of virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have insinuated that you ran only to overtake me not to escape the clutches of the lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goaded by longsuffering patience the worm will turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forget nothing as yet professor archimedes q <end> <end> 
<start> <start> porter but believe me sir i am tottering on the verge of forgetfulness as to your exalted position in the world of science and your gray hairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the professor sat in silence for a few minutes and the darkness hid the grim smile that wreathed his wrinkled countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here skinny philander he said in belligerent tones if you are lookin for a scrap peel off your coat and come on down on the ground and ill punch your head just as i did sixty years ago in the alley back of porky evans barn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when youre human ark i love you but somehow it seems as though you had forgotten how to be human for the last twenty years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the professor reached out a thin trembling old hand through the darkness until it found his old friends shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elfrida had scattered handfuls of seeds over the snow in the garden that the wild birds might have a comfortable breakfast next morning and had stuffed bundles of dried grasses in the fireplaces so that the reindeer of santa claus could refresh themselves after their long gallops across country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was really only done for fun but it pleased carol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert went off with some boys to see if they could catch any fish in the deeper part of the brook about half a mile from the picnic grove and nan with one or two girls about her own age took a little walk with flossie and freddie to gather some late wild flowers that grew on the side of one of the hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they found a number of the blossoms and were making pretty bouquets of them when freddie who had gone on a little ahead of the rest came running back so fast that he nearly rolled to the bottom of the hill so fat and chubby was he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked nan catching her brother just in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got a book about snakes and hell know what to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put it in a cool dark place and im going to put lots of water on it every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moss must be very cool and damp to grow mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember how disappointed i used to be when i was a little girl and tried to make it grow around my geraniums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would always dry up and turn brown in a few days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh called freddie from his garden under the cherry tree come quick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan and flossie hurried to where their little brother had dug a hole in the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while flossie ran to tell bert nan watched the tiny mice so that they would not get away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a nest of field mice harry told them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well put them in a cage and have them in our circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theyre my mice cried freddie and i wont let anybody have them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were only going to help you take care of them in a little box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh theres the mother catch her harry called bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother mouse was not so easy to catch however and the boys had quite a chase after her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last she ran into a tin box the boys had sunk in the ground when playing golf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got a queer kind of a trap harry said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can put them in this until we build a larger one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can make one out of a box with a wire door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mice were the smallest cutest things not larger than freddies thumb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall make the best of your lessons believe me and in this way we shall never be separated will you remain for ever in prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said and after having granted you your life will not his highness also grant you your liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and will you not then recover your fortune and be a rich man and then when you are driving in your own coach riding your own horse will you still look at poor rosa the daughter of a jailer scarcely better cornelius tried to contradict her and certainly he would have done so with all his heart and with all the sincerity she however smilingly interrupted him saying how is to speak to cornelius of his tulip was an expedient resorted very well indeed he said the coat is growing black the sprouting has commenced the veins of the bulb are swelling in eight days hence and perhaps sooner we may distinguish the first buds of the leaves protruding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a low arched portal outside the church in a dark nook behind a column and had such great iron hinges and such but what was his astonishment when coming bareheaded to the church and putting his hand into this dark nook with a certain misgiving that it might be unexpectedly seized and a shivering propensity to draw it back again he found that the door which he thought on the first surprise of going back or of getting a light or a companion but his courage aided him immediately and what have i to fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides the ringers may be there and have forgotten to shut the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he went in feeling his way as he went like a blind man for it was the dust from the street had blown into the recess and lying there heaped up made it so soft and velvetlike to the foot that there was something startling even in that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jessamy if he copies after me h stay here one moment and i will call him.jona than!mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we shall have to begin how stupid they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to fight us who are simply trying to bring about peaceably and sensibly whats yesthe rain is bound to come said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we say heres an umbrella and theres the way to shelter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they laugh at our umbrella and with the first drops plashing on their the workingmens league always first in the field with its ticket had been unusually early that year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although it was only the first week in august and the election would not be until the third of october the league had nominated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a ticket made up entirely of skilled workers who had lived all their lives in remsen city and who had acquired an independence victor dorn was careful not to expose to the falling fire of the opposition any of his men who could be ruined by the loss of a job or could be compelled to leave town in search of work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the league always went early into campaign because it pursued a much slower and less expensive method of electioneering than either of the old partiesor than any of the upper class reform parties that sprang up from time to time and died away as they accomplished or failed of their purposesecuring recognition for certain personal ambitions not agreeable to the old established bosses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides the league was like the bosses and their henchmen in politics every day in every year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the league theory was that politics was as much a part of a citizens daily routine as his other work or his meals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the night of the leagues great ratification meeting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day the first campaign number containing the biographical sketch of tony rivers kellys righthand man would go upon the press and on the following day it would reach the public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> market square in remsen city was on the edge of the power quarter was surrounded by cheap hotels boarding houses and saloons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few years before the most notable citizens market basket on arm could have been seen three mornings in the week making the rounds of the stalls and stands both those in the open and those within the market house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but customs had rapidly changed in remsen city and with the exception of a few old fogies only the poorer classes went to market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the masters of houses were becoming gentlemen and the housewives were elevating into ladiesand it goes without saying that no gentleman and no lady would descend to a menial task even in private much less in public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> market square had even become too common for any but the inferior meetings of the two leading political parties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the workingmens league held to the old tradition that a political meeting of the first rank could be properly held nowhere but in the natural assembling place of the peopletheir market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so their first great rally of the campaign was billed for market square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at eight oclock headed by a large and vigorous drum corps the victor dorn cohorts at their full strength marched into the centre of the square where one of the stands had been transformed with flags bunting and torches into a speakers platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a crowd of many thousands accompanied and followed the procession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> workingmens league meetings were popular even among those who believed their interests lay elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at league meetings one heard the plain truth sometimes extremely startling plain truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the league had no favors to ask of anybody had nothing to conceal was strongly opposed to any and all political concealments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus its speakers enjoyed a freedom not usual in political speakingand dorn and his fellowleaders were careful that no router no exaggerator or well intentioned wild man of any kind should open his mouth under a league banner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was what made the league so dangerousand so steadily prosperous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chairman thomas colman the cooper was opening the meeting in a speech which was an instance of how well a man of no platform talent can acquit himself when he believes something and believes it is his duty to convey it to his fellowmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be real superiorityand our life now is so vain so empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked curious as always when a new idea was presented to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this was certainly newapparently philanthropy without expense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not put your great combine on such a basis that it would bring an honest just return to you and the others and would pay the highest possible wages and would give the people the benefit of what your genius for manufacturing and for finance has made possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we who are so comfortable and never have to think of the necessaries of life forget how much a few cents here and there mean to most people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the things you control mean all the difference between warmth and cold between life and death john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she talked he settled back into his chair and his face hardened into its unyielding expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not philanthropy without expense but philanthropy at the expense both of his fortune and of his position as a master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to use his brain and his life for those ungrateful people who derided his benefactions as either contributions to the conscience fund or as indirect attempts at public bribery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not conceal his impatiencethough he did not venture to put it into words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if weif you and i john she hurried on leaning toward him in her earnestness had something like that to live for it might come to be very different with usandim thinking of gardiner most of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one no one can lead this kind of life without being dragged down without becoming selfish and sordid and cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont understand he said curtly without looking at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she winced and was silent sat watching his bold strong profile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she said in a changed strange strained voice what i asked to see you for wasjohn wont you put the pricesat least where they were at the beginning of this dreadful winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve been listening to the lies about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reading she said her eyes flashing at the insult in the accusation that she had let people attack him to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well reading then he went on wondering what he had said that angered her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he made an elaborate explanationabout the necessity of meeting fixed charges which he himself had fixed about fair share of prosperity everything more expensive the country better able to pay every one doing as we are and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she listened closely she had not come ignorant of the subject and she penetrated his sophistries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he saw her expression saw he had failed to convince her into his eyes came the look she understood wellthe look that told her she would only infuriate him and bruise herself by flinging herself against the iron of his resolve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont get married every day and in addition to these dainties there were the veal and hampie and things as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peerybingle called them which were chiefly nuts and oranges and cakes and such small deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the repast was set forth on the board flanked by calebs contribution which was a great wooden bowl of smoking potatoes he was prohibited by solemn compact from producing any other viands tackleton led his intended motherinlaw to the post of honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the better gracing of this place at the high festival the majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caleb sat next his daughter dot and her old schoolfellow were side by side the good carrier took care of the bottom of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss slowboy was isolated for the time being from every article of furniture but the chair she sat on that she might have nothing else to knock the babys head against <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as tilly stared about her at the dolls and toys they stared at her and at the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was going to bet me a sixforty he has at nashboro that his horse could beat mine on the greasy cove track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the landlord apologetically nollichucky is he a man of honor or isnt he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord sir i only seen him once but id stake my oath on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith a thoroughbred hoss says he sech nostrils and sech a gray eye with the devil in it fer goyellow they rud into town he lowered his voice for the room was filling snapped their fingers at tipton and his warrant and rud out agin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my god but that was like nollichucky jack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson who had been divided between astonishment and impatience and anger burst out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the devil do you mean by interfering with my business sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because it is my business too i answered quite as by jehovah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried jackson come outside sir the landlord backed away and the men in the tavern began to press around us expectantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont let him git near no fences stranger said another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson turned on this man with such truculence that he edged away to the rear of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson starting for the door before i could reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed perforce not without misgivings the crowd pushing eagerly after <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before we reached the dusty street jackson began pulling off his coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a trice the shouting onlookers had made a ring and we stood facing each other he in his shirtsleeves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well fight fair said he his lips wetting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very good said i if you are still accustomed to this hasty manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not asked my name my i know not whether it was what i said that made him stare or how i said it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said i i am in a hurry to find mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noise of the crowd was hushed and they drew nearer to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson said i you are a lawyer and a gentleman and so am i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not care to be beaten to a pulp but i am not afraid of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will step back into the tavern i will explain to you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the eternal said he you are a cool man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me my coat he shouted to the bystanders and they helped him on with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said he as they made to follow him keep back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the heavens he cried when he had gained the room i believe you are not afraid of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw it in your then i laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson said i doubtless you do not remember a homeless boy named david whom you took to your i do he exclaimed as i live i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why we slept and you stumped your toe getting into bed and swore said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that he laughed so heartily that the landlord came running across the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we fought together at the old fields school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah i answered i come to that quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after i left your uncles house is he a charlestown temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i spent some time gambling and horse racing with the gentry there and i know many of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a wild lad i repeat his exact words and i ran up a bill in charlestown that would have filled a folio volume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith all i had left me was the clothes on my back and a good horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made up my mind one night that if i could pay my debts and get out of charlestown i would go into the back country and study law and sober down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> braiden in the ordinary who staked me two hundred dollars at rattleandsnap against my horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i left charlestown with honor i studied law at salisbury in north carolina you seem to have the talent said i smiling at the remembrance of the hump gibson incident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is my history in a nutshell said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he added since you are mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temples cousin and friend and an old acquaintance of mine to boot i will where is that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill stake a cowbell that sevier will stop at the widow browns he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mind you you are to tell mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple that he is to come ill warrant him to come said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon we left the inn together more amicably than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson had a thoroughbred horse near by that was a pleasure to see and my admiration of his mount seemed to set me as firmly in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacksons esteem again as that gentleman himself sat in the saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as good as his word rode out with me some distance on the road and reminded me at the last that nick was to race him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sat at the open window trying to fancy the air was fresher there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and dark beyond in the roadway a gas lamp burnt bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farther were the three lights of the railway signal against the lowering sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man and woman spoke to one another in low tones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not he she said peevishly as though that too irritated her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of these men of iron have he said sententiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned her discontented face towards the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew in volume the house quivered one heard the metallic rattle of the tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the train passed there was a glare of light above the cutting and a driving tumult of smoke one two three four five six seven eight black oblongseight truckspassed across the dim grey of the embankment and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the tunnel which with the last seemed to swallow down train smoke and sound in one abrupt gulp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this country was all fresh and beautiful once he said and nowit is gehenna <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down that waynothing but potbanks and chimneys belching fire and dust into the face of heaven but what does it matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an end comes an end to all this cruelty tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke the last word in a whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seized him with desperate fingers cried i am content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you afraid of the scandalbecause everything for the wedding has gone so far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried sheperhaps too vigorously a woman would have thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what else is there for me to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you certainly havent shown any consideration for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you told me yourself that you were false to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she forgot her fear in a gush of rage rising from sudden realization of what she was doingof how leniently and weakly and without pride she was dealing with this man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt you admit pardon me said he and his manner might well have calmed the wildest tempest of anger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i leave that to people of the sort who explain and excuse and apologize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply told you i was paying the expenses of a family named hallowell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could understand how the opposition witnesses dreaded facing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me you were admitting i mean you were confirming what that man accused you of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might say of what do you accuse me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she remained silent he went on i am trying to be reasonable josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the look in her eyesthe fear the timiditywas a startling revelation of characterof the cowardice with which love undermines the strongest nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know ive been foolish and incoherent fred she pleaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you remember how i always was afraid of that girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to be admiring you for your generosityyour charity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its neither the one nor the other said he with exasperating deliberateness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are driving me crazy with your evasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he buttoned his coat in tranquil preparation to depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my fault not asking you straight out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you are too cross with me thendont tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughed nervously hiding her submission beneath a seeming of mocking exaggeration of humility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man who admired her as a figure a man who liked her a man who had no feeling for her beyond the general human feeling of wishing well pretty nearly everybodyin brief any man but one who had loved her and had gotten over it would have deeply pitied and sympathized with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred norman said his look and i am backing mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hallowell in a company for which he is doing chemical research work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are hatching eggs out of the shell so to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also we are aging and rejuvenating arthropods and the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the girls in a low slow whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and suddenly tearing away from their clinging arms she burst into a hysterical fit of tears bowing herself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly o yes yes yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having once given way she could not stop her weeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ought to have had one of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i ought to make him even now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would be better for him thani dont know what im saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went up to her and clasped her round but still her sobs tore her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get some water said marian shes upset by us poor thing poor thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gently led her back to the side of her bed where they kissed her warmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more ladylike and a better scholar than we especially since he had taught ee so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i am she said and i am ashamed at so breaking down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were all in bed and the light was out you will think of us when you be his wife tess and of how we told ee that we loved him and how we tried not to hate you and did not hate you and could not hate you because you were his choice and we never hoped to be chose by him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not aware that at these words salt stinging tears trickled down upon tesss pillow anew and how she resolved with a bursting heart to tell all her history to angel clare despite her mothers commandto let him for whom she lived and breathed despise her if he would and her mother regard her as a fool rather then preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him and which somehow seemed a wrong to these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this penitential mood kept her from naming the weddingday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beginning of november found its date still in abeyance though he asked her at the most tempting times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tesss desire seemed to be for a perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the meads were changing now but it was still warm enough in early afternoons before milking to idle there awhile and the state of dairywork at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun a glistening ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary like the track of moonlight on the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gnats knowing nothing of their brief glorification wandered across the shimmer of this pathway irradiated as if they bore fire within them then passed out of its line and were quite extinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the presence of these things he would remind her that the date was still the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or he would ask her at night when he accompanied her on some mission invented by mrs crick to give him the opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was mostly a journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale to inquire how the advanced cows were getting on in the strawbarton to which they were relegated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it was a time of the year that brought great changes to the world of kine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> batches of the animals were sent away daily to this lyingin hospital where they lived on straw till their calves were born after which event and as soon as the calf could walk mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was of course little milking to be done but as soon as the calf had been taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great gravelcliff immediately over the levels where they stood still and listened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water was now high in the streams squirting through the weirs and tinkling under culverts the smallest gullies were all full there was no taking short cuts anywhere and footpassengers were compelled to follow the permanent ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the whole extent of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation it forced upon their fancy that a great city lay below them and that the murmur was the vociferation of its populace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems like tens of thousands of them said tess holding publicmeetings in their marketplaces arguing preaching quarrelling sobbing groaning praying and cursing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did crick speak to you today dear about his not wanting much assistance during the winter months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six of seven went to the strawbarton yesterday and three the day before making nearly twenty in the straw already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ahis it that the farmer dont want my help for the calving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o i am not wanted here any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i have tried so hard to crick didnt exactly say that he would no longer require you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like going into a tigers den with a piece of raw meat in your hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as likely as not to rend you for your pains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact he was always threatening to do that very thing and the urgency of the case combined with the impossibility of handling it with safety made sterne in his watches below toss and mutter openeyed in his bunk for hours as though he had been burning with fever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> occurrences like the crossing of the bar just now were extremely alarming to his prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not want to be left behind by some swift catastrophe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy be ing on the bridge the old man had to brace himself up and make a show he supposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was getting very bad with him very bad indeed now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even massy had been emboldened to find fault this time sterne listen ing at the foot of the ladder had heard the others whimpering and artless denunciations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> luckily the beast was very stupid and could not see the why of all this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however small blame to him it took a clever man to hit upon the cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless it was high time to do something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old mans game could not be kept up for many days more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may yet lose my life at this foolinglet alone my chance sterne mumbled angrily to himself after the stooping back of the chief engineer had disappeared round the corner of the skylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes no doubthe thought but to blurt out his knowledge would not ad vance his prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary it would blast them utterly as likely as not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a vague consciousness of not being much liked by his fellows in this part of the world inex plicably enough for he had done nothing to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people were always down on a clever chap who made no bones about his determination to get on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to do your duty and count on the gratitude of that brute massy would be sheer folly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a brute without a spark of anything human about him without so much as simple curiosity even or else surely he would have responded in some way to all these hints he had been given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after half a minutes pause during which he delicately moistens the ball of his dealing thumb exclaims le jeu est fait rien ne va plus and proceeds to interpret the decrees of fate according to the approved fashion of trente et quarante <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a similar scene is taking place at the roulette tablea goodly crop of florins with here and there a speck of gold shining amongst the silver harvest is being sown over the field of the cloth of green soon to be reaped by the croupiers sickle and the pith ball is being dropped into the revolving basin that is partitioned off into so many tiny black and red niches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the next twelve hours the processes in question are carried on swiftly and steadily without variation or loss of time relays of croupiers are laid on who unobtrusively slip into the places of their fellows when the hours arrive for relieving guard the game is never stopped for more than a couple of minutes at a time viz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the cards run out and have to be reshuffled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this brief interruption is commonly considered to portend a break in the particular vein which the game may have happened to assume during the dealsay a run upon black or red an alternation of coups in threes or fours upon either colour two reds and a black or vice versa all equally frequent eccentricities of the cards and the heavier players often change their seats or leave the table altogether for an hour or so at such a conjuncture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> curiously enough excepting at the very commencement of the days play the habitues of the trente et quarante tables appear to entertain a strong antipathy to the first deal or two after the cards have been remade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been told by one or two masters of the craft that they have a fancy to see how matters are likely to go before they strike in as if it were possible to deduce the future of the game from its past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it is possible appears to be an article of faith with the old stagers and indeed every now and then odd coincidences occur which tend to confirm them in their creed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i witnessed an occurrence which was either attributable as i believe to sheer chance or as its hero earnestly assured me to instinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fair and frail magyar was punting on numbers with immense pluck and uniform ill fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind her stood a viennese gentleman of my acquaintance who enjoys a certain renown amongst his friends for the faculty of prophecy which however he seldom exercises for his own benefit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observing that she hesitated about staking her double florin he advised her to set it on the number round went the wheel and in twenty seconds the ball tumbled into compartment sure enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the next turn she asked his advice and was told to try number no sooner said than done and came up in due course whereby mdlle l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> won odd gulden in two coups the amount risked by her being exactly four florins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a wise girl she walked off with her booty and played no more that day at roulette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few minutes later i saw an englishman go through the performance of losing four thousand francs by experimentalizing on single numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twenty times running did he set ten louisdors on a number varying the number at each stake and not one of his selection proved successful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the thirty and forty i saw an eminent diplomatist win sixty thousand francs with scarcely an intermission of failure he played all over the table pushing his rouleaux backwards and forwards from black to red without any appearance of system that i could detect and the cards seemed to follow his inspiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gentleman who had lost considerable sums of money at various times announced his full determination never to come to a place of the sort again with money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his visits therefore were no longer wanted and so orders were given to the porters not to admit him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about two oclock on a subsequent night which happened to be saturday he sought admittance and was refused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a warm altercation ensued in the passage between him and the porters which brought down some of the proprietors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of thema powerful mana bankrupt butcherstruck him a tremendous blow which broke the bridge of his nose covered his face with blood and knocked him down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on getting up he was knocked down again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he arose once more and instantly received another blow which would have laid him upon his back but one of the porters by this time had got behind him and as he was falling struck him at the back of his head which sent him upon his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the watch had now arrived into whose hands the keeper of the hell and the porter were given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the watchhouse they were ordered to find bail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gentleman was then about quitting when he was suddenly called back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain little lawyer who alternately prosecutes and defends keepers of gaming houses was sent for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he whispered to the ex butcher to charge the gentleman with stealing his handkerchief and hat which it was alleged had been lost in the affray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though nothing was found upon the gentleman who desired to be searched this preposterous and groundless charge was taken and the hellites admitted to bail but the gentleman who had been so cruelly beaten being charged with a felony on purpose to cause his detention and the power held by magistrates to take bail in doubtful cases not extending to nightconstables he was locked up below with two wretches who had stolen lead and five disorderlieshis face a mass of blood and bruisesand there detained till monday morning in a most pitiable condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the magistrate before whom the party appeared on that day understanding that the affair took place at a gaming house dismissed both complaints leaving the parties to their remedy at gaffing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gaffing is or was one of the ten thousand modes of swindling practised in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> formerly it was a game in very great vogue among the macers who congregated nightly at the flash houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these is described as followsthis gaffer laughed a great deal and whistled moores melodies and extracted music from a deal table with his elbow and wrist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he hid a halfpenny and a flat cried head for l a tail was sure to turn up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of his modes of commanding the turnup was this he had a halfpenny with two heads and a halfpenny with two tails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he gaffed he contrived to have both halfpence under his hand and long practice enabled him to catch up in the wrinkles or muscles of it the halfpenny which it was his interest to conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if tail was called a head appeared and the tail halfpenny ran down his wrist with astonishing fidelity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this ingenious fellow often won or sovereigns a night by gaffing but the landlord and other men who were privy to the robbery and pitched the baby card that is encouraged the loser by sham betting always came in for the regulars that is their share of the plunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gaffer contrived to bilk all the turnpikes in the kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this mournful song was no sooner ended than supper was served and the company proved themselves good trenchermen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius caught sight of the seditious friar making short work of the convents victuals and marvelled to see him in a place to which he had given so evil a name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin was unfeignedly glad to see the lad and listened intently to his tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he nodded his head as hilarius related how the friar he companied with preached in each village that men should repent ere the scourge of god fell upon them but there is naught of it as yet said the lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay nay it is like a thief in the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day it is not and then the next men sicken and fall like blasted wheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard a bruit of london that it was but a heap of graves nay one grave rather for they flung the bodies into a great trench there was no time to do otherwise black death is swift with his stroke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then hilarius told of piping hugh and the friars deathwords to the guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the harvester would not have her there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seated her at the dining table beside the window overlooking the lake lighted a pair of his homemade candles in his finest sticks and placed before her bread butter cold meat milk and fruit and together they ate their first meal in their home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had known said the harvester granny moreland is a famous cook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is a southern woman and she can fry chicken and make some especial dishes to surpass any one i ever knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would have been id much rather have this and be by ourselves said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you can bank on it i would agreed the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance if any one were here i might feel restrained about telling you that you are exactly the beautiful flushed dream girl i have adored for months and your dress most becoming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are oh why did you say that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ive got to feel like a sneak or tell youand i didnt dont you ever tell me or any one else anything you dont want to said the harvester roundly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was fool enough to think you wouldnt notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know they were doing it but when it all washed off i looked so ghastly i almost frightened myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hunted through the boxes they put up for but dont all the daintiest women powder these days and consider it indispensable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clerk said so and ive noticed it mentioned in the papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bought yes just powder but man i put on a lot of cold cream first to stick the powder good and thick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well since youve told it is your conscience perfectly at ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are lovely and if you dont use enough powder to cover the paleness until your colour returns ill hold you and put it on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you feel better when you you are no such thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there hasnt a woman in ten thousand got any such rope of hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been seeing the papers on the hair question too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they think your hair is false when it is natural they wont be any more fooled when they think your colour is real and it isnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very soon it will be and no one need ever know the difference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you go on and fix up your level best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to see yourself appearing well will make you harvesterman said the girl gazing at him with wet luminous eyes for the sake of other women i could wish that all men had an oath to keep and had here is the place we adjourn to the moon cried the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know of anything that can cure a sudden accession of swell head like gazing at the heavens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one finds his place among the atoms naturally and instantaneously with the eyes on the night sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe there is one among my orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but upstairs with mothers clothing there are several shawls and shoulder capes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all of them were washed and carefully packed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wouldnt she like me to wear her things better than to have them lying in moth the harvester looked at her and shook his head marvelling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell how pleased she would be he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could use them to help furnish the house and it wouldnt the harvester liked that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the washed things are in those boxes upstairs also some fine skins ive saved on the chance of wanting them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her dishes are in the bottom of the china closet there she was mighty proud of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the furniture and carpets were so old and abused i burned them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill he took the candle and climbed the stairs soon returning with a little white wool shawl and a big pink coverlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got this for her christmas one time he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shed he folded it around the girls shoulders and picked up the coverlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre never going to take that to the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took it in her hands to find a corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very thought was an insult to the white people of the south <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for tryons liberality of which he had spoken so nobly and so sincerely had been confined unconsciously and as a matter of course within the boundaries of his own race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the southern mind in discussing abstract questions relative to humanity makes always consciously or unconsciously the mental reservation that the conclusions reached do not apply to the negro unless they can be made to harmonize with the customs of the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but reasoning thus was not without effect upon a mind by nature reasonable above the average <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryons race impulse and social prejudice had carried him too far and the swing of the mental pendulum brought his thoughts rapidly back in the opposite direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tossing uneasily on the bed where he had thrown himself down without undressing the air of the room oppressed him and he threw open the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cool night air calmed his throbbing pulses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moonlight streaming through the window flooded the room with a soft light in which he seemed to see rena standing before him as she had appeared that afternoon gazing at him with eyes that implored charity and forgiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he burst into tears bitter tears that strained his heartstrings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was his first love and he had lost her forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was worse than dead to him for if he had seen her lying in her shroud before him he could at least have cherished her memory now even this consolation was denied him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town clockwhich so long as it was wound up regularly recked nothing of love or hate joy or sorrowsolemnly tolled out the hour of midnight and sounded the knell of his lost love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lost she was as though she had never been as she had indeed had no right to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolutely determined to banish her image from his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see her again he could not it would be painful to them both it could be productive of no good to either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had felt the power and charm of love and no ordinary shook could have loosened its hold but this catastrophe which had so rudely swept away the groundwork of his passion had stirred into new life all the slumbering pride of race and ancestry which characterized his caste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much of this sensitive superiority was essential and how much accidental how much of it was due to the eversuggested comparison with a servile race how much of it was ignorance and selfconceit to what extent the boasted purity of his race would have been contaminated by the fair woman whose image filled his memoryof these things he never thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not influenced by sordid considerations he would have denied that his course was controlled by any narrow prudence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont think i am as good as they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant even agree with you without saying something that has a disagreeable sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman sat down and looked at her for some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when you say it i believe it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a poor reason said madame de cintre smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have a high spirit a high standard but with you its all natural and unaffected you dont seem to have stuck your head into a vise as if you were sitting for the photograph of propriety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think of me as a fellow who has had no idea in life but to make money and drive sharp bargains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a fair description of me but it is not the whole story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man ought to care for something else though i dont know exactly what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cared for moneymaking but i never cared particularly for the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing else to do and it was impossible to be idle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been very easy to others and to myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have done most of the things that people asked mei dont mean rascals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as regards your mother and your brother newman added there is only one point upon which i feel that i might quarrel with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont ask them to sing my praises to you but i ask them to let you alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i thought they talked ill of me to you i should come down upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have let me alone as you say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that case cried newman i declare they are only too good for this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre appeared to find something startling in his exclamation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would perhaps have replied but at this moment the door was thrown open and urbain de bellegarde stepped across the threshold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he appeared surprised at finding newman but his surprise was but a momentary shadow across the surface of an unwonted joviality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman had never seen the marquis so exhilarated his pale unlighted countenance had a sort of thin transfiguration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held open the door for some one else to enter and presently appeared old madame de bellegarde leaning on the arm of a gentleman whom newman had not seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had already risen and madame de cintre rose as she always did before her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis who had greeted newman almost genially stood apart slowly rubbing his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave a majestic little nod at newman and then she released the strange gentleman that he might make his bow to her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my daughter she said i have brought you an unknown relative lord deepmere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord deepmere is our cousin but he has done only today what he ought to have done long ago come to make our acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre smiled and offered lord deepmere her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very extraordinary said this noble laggard but this is the first time that i have ever been in paris for more than three or four weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how long have you been here now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh for the last two months said lord deepmere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these two remarks might have constituted an impertinence but a glance at lord deepmeres face would have satisfied you as it apparently satisfied madame de cintre that they constituted only a naivete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his companions were seated newman who was out of the conversation occupied himself with observing the newcomer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observation however as regards lord deepmeres person had no great range <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a small meagre man of some three and thirty years of age with a bald head a short nose and no front teeth in the upper jaw he had round candid blue eyes and several pimples on his chin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was evidently very shy and he laughed a great deal catching his breath with an odd startling sound as the most convenient imitation of repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his physiognomy denoted great simplicity a certain amount of brutality and probable failure in the past to profit by rare educational advantages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remarked that paris was awfully jolly but that for real thoroughpaced entertainment it was nothing to dublin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had madame de cintre ever been to dublin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they must all come over there some day and he would show them some irish sport <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he always went to ireland for the fishing and he came to paris for the new offenbach things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they always brought them out in dublin but he couldnt wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been nine times to hear la pomme de paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre leaning back with her arms folded looked at lord deepmere with a more visibly puzzled face than she usually showed to society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde on the other hand wore a fixed smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis said that among light operas his favorite was the gazza ladra <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquise then began a series of inquiries about the duke and the cardinal the old countess and lady barbara after listening to which and to lord deepmeres somewhat irreverent responses for a quarter of an hour newman rose to take his leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis went with him three steps into the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed he is only too discreet he seems on his guard against me as if he thought me rather light company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other day he told his sister gertrude repeated it to methat i was always laughing at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i laugh it is simply from the impulse to try and inspire him with confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cliffords situation is no laughing matter said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very peculiar as i suppose you have guessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah you mean his love affair with his cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have decided not to speak of it unless we are asked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has been requested by the harvard authorities to absent himself for six months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand will help him at least we hope so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand certainly will not teach him any of those secrets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was too fond of something of which he should not have been fond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear uncle is there any doubt about its being a pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cest de son age as they say in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have said rather it was a vice of later life of disappointed old age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix glanced at his uncle with his lifted eyebrows and then of what are you speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the situation in which clifford was found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rather suspected that from something i observed the first day i came here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i quite agree with you that it is a low taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it s not a vice for a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hope for a good deal from mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by contrast with the brilliancy outside it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i entered it groping for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pair of eyes luminous by reflection against the daylight without was watching me out of the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i remembered that strange terror of the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> overcoming my fear to some extent i advanced a step and spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will admit that my voice was harsh and illcontrolled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put out my hand and touched something soft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once the eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned with my heart in my mouth and saw a queer little apelike figure its head held down in a peculiar manner running across the sunlit space behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it blundered against a block of granite staggered aside and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the flowing hair was all gone nothing remained but the red nose and the sparkling eyes which looked more malicious than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and no wonder thought gluck after being treated in that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sauntered disconsolately to the window and sat himself down to catch the fresh evening air and escape the hot breath of the furnace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this window commanded a direct view of the range of mountains which as i told you before overhung the treasure valley and more especially of the peak from which fell the golden river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> k to ask no questions in his dealings with the trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they bring the body and we pay the price he used to say dwelling on the alliteration quid pro quo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and again and somewhat profanely ask no questions he would tell his assistants for conscience sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no understanding that the subjects were provided by the crime of murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had that idea been broached to him in words he would have recoiled in horror but the lightness of his speech upon so grave a matter was in itself an offence against good manners and a temptation to the men with whom he dealt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes for instance had often remarked to himself upon the singular freshness of the bodies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been struck again and again by the hangdog abominable looks of the ruffians who came to him before the dawn and putting things together clearly in his private thoughts he perhaps attributed a meaning too immoral and too categorical to the unguarded counsels of his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he understood his duty in short to have three branches to take what was brought to pay the price and to avert the eye from any evidence of crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one november morning this policy of silence was put sharply to the test <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been awake all night with a racking toothache pacing his room like a caged beast or throwing himself in fury on his bed and had fallen at last into that profound uneasy slumber that so often follows on a night of pain when he was awakened by the third or fourth angry repetition of the concerted signal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a thin bright moonshine it was bitter cold windy and frosty the town had not yet awakened but an indefinable stir already preluded the noise and business of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ghouls had come later than usual and they seemed more than usually eager to be gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard their grumbling irish voices through a dream and as they stripped the sack from their sad merchandise he leaned dozing with his shoulder propped against the wall he had to shake himself to find the men their money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he did so his eyes lighted on the dead face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he started he took two steps nearer with the candle raised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a beautiful day therell be a great crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to look at the people to look at types the girl went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall sit under the trees we shall walk by the row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go once a year on business said st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or with a country cousin didnt you tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued over her shoulder to paul as their friend drew her toward a hansom to which he had signalled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man watched them get in he returned as he stood there the friendly wave of the hand with which ensconced in the vehicle beside her st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he even lingered to see the vehicle start away and lose itself in the confusion of bond street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he followed it with his eyes it put to him embarrassing things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great novelist had said emphatically at summersoft but his manner of conducting himself toward her appeared not quite in harmony with such a conviction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing must have been sixteen or eighteen feet in length and closely resembled pictures i had seen of restored plesiosaurs of the lower jurassic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it charged us as savagely as a mad bull and one would have thought it intended to destroy and devour the mighty uboat as i verily believe it did intend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were moving slowly up the river as the creature bore down upon us with distended jaws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the long neck was far outstretched and the four flippers with which it swam were working with powerful strokes carrying it forward at a rapid pace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it reached the crafts side the jaws closed upon one of the stanchions of the deck rail and tore it from its socket as though it had been a toothpick stuck in putty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this exhibition of titanic strength i think we all simultaneously stepped backward and bradley drew his revolver and fired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bullet struck the thing in the neck just above its body but instead of disabling it merely increased its rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its hissing rose to a shrill scream as it raised half its body out of water onto the sloping sides of the hull of the u and endeavored to scramble upon the deck to devour us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dozen shots rang out as we who were armed drew our pistols and fired at the thing but though struck several times it showed no signs of succumbing and only floundered farther aboard the submarine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have made an impression upon her young heart which gives me the most serious alarm to prevent that impression from growing stronger i am obliged to decline your acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for me you may be sure that i should rejoice at establishing my child so advantageously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conscious that my constitution impaired by grief and illness forbids me to expect a long continuance in this world i tremble at the thought of leaving her under the protection of a perfect he will marry his lady may look upon antonia with an eye of displeasure and deprive her of her only friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should the duke your uncle give his consent you need not doubt obtaining mine and my daughters but without his hope not for ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at all events what ever steps you may take what ever may be the dukes decision till you know it let me beg your forbearing to strengthen by your presence antonias prepossession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the sanction of your relations authorises your addressing her as your wife my doors fly open to you if that sanction is refused be satisfied to possess my esteem and gratitude but remember that lorenzo promised reluctantly to conform to this decree but he added that he hoped soon to obtain that consent which would give him a claim to the renewal of their acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then explained to her why the marquis had not called in person and made no scruple of confiding to her his sisters history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he concluded by saying that he hoped to set agnes at liberty the next day and that as soon as don raymonds fears were quieted upon this subject he would lose no time in assuring donna elvira of his friendship and protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tremble for your sister said she i have heard many traits of the domina of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clares character from a friend who was educated in the same convent with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reported her to be haughty inflexible superstitious and revengeful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have since heard that she is infatuated with the idea of rendering her convent the most regular in madrid and never forgave those whose imprudence threw upon it the slightest stain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though naturally violent and severe when her interests require it she well knows how to assume an appearance of benignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she leaves no means untried to persuade young women of rank to become members of her community she is implacable when once incensed and has too much intrepidity to shrink at taking the most rigorous measures for punishing the offender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless she will consider your sisters quitting the convent as a disgrace thrown upon it she will use every artifice to avoid obeying the mandate of his holiness and i shudder to think that donna agnes is in the lorenzo now rose to take leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elvira gave him her hand at parting which he kissed respectfully and telling her that he soon hoped for the permission to salute that of antonia he returned to his hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady was perfectly satisfied with the conversation which had past between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked forward with satisfaction to the prospect of his becoming her sonin law but prudence bad her conceal from her daughters knowledge the flattering hopes which herself now ventured to entertain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarcely was it day and already lorenzo was at the convent of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waited impatiently for the conclusion of the service and at length the prioress appeared at the parlour grate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady replied with a melancholy air that the dear childs situation grew hourly more dangerous that the physicians despaired of her life but that they had declared the only chance for her recovery to consist in keeping her quiet and not to permit those to approach her whose presence was likely to agitate her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a word of all this was believed by lorenzo any more than he credited the expressions of grief and affection for agnes with which this account was interlarded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to end the business he put the popes bull into the hands of the domina and insisted that ill or in health his sister should be delivered to him without delay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prioress received the paper with an air of humility but no sooner had her eye glanced over the contents than her resentment baffled all the efforts of hypocrisy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a deep crimson spread itself over her face and she darted upon lorenzo looks of rage and menace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this order is positive said she in a voice of anger which she in vain strove to disguise willingly would i obey it but lorenzo interrupted her by an exclamation of surprize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i repeat it segnor to obey this order is totally out of my power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from tenderness to a brothers feelings i would have communicated the sad event to you by degrees and have prepared you to hear it with fortitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my measures are broken through this order commands me to deliver up to you the sister agnes without delay i am therefore obliged to inform you without lorenzo started back with horror and turned pale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the cow country he wears stetson hats snake bands red handkerchiefs sixshooters chaps and huge spurs that do not match his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it is yachting he has a chronometer with a gong in the cabin of a fiveton sailboat possesses a nickleplated machine to register the heel of his craft sports a brassbound yachtingcap and all the regalia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i never could understand his insane desire to get sunburned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man will get sunburned fast enough he could not help it if he would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> algernon usually starts out from town without a hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he dares not take off his sweater for a week lest it carry away his entire face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen men with deep sores on their shoulders caused by nothing but excessive burning in the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it means quite simply that algernon realizes his inner deficiencies and wants to make up for them by the outward seeming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be kind to him for he has been raised a pet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot is lovablemysterious in how he does itand awfully unexpected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day we tied our horses to three bushes and walked on foot two hundred yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a river meandering through olivecolored forests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so distant that it was light green and as narrow as a piece of tape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there were rapids but so remote that we could not distinguish the motion of them only the color <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white resembled tiny dabs of cotton wool stuck on the tape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it turned and twisted following the turns and twists of the canon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow the level at the bottom resembled less forests and meadows than a heavy and sluggish fluid like molasses flowing between the canon walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cellmate told him that the papers had scored the department heavily for their failure to apprehend the murderer of the inoffensive old schneider and that public opinion had been so aroused that a general police shakeup had followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result was that the police were keen to fasten the guilt upon someonethey did not care whom so long as it was someone who was in their custody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may not o done it ventured the cellmate but theyll send you up for it if they cant hang you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre goin to try to get the death sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they haint got no love for you byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you caused em a lot o throuble in your day an they havent forgot it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed to have faded back into the old distrust and hatred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook himself and conjured in his mind the vision of a beautiful girl who had believed in him and trusted him who had inculcated within him a love for all that was finest and best in true manhood for the very things that he had most hated all the years of his life before she had come into his existence to alter it and him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then billy would believe againbelieve that in the end justice would triumph and that it would all come out right just the way he had pictured it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the coming of the last day of the trial billy found it more and more difficult to adhere to his regard for law order and justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prosecution had shown conclusively that billy was a hard customer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the police had brought witnesses who did not hesitate to perjure themselves in their testimony testimony which it seemed to billy the densest of jurymen could plainly see had been framed up and learned by rote until it was letterperfect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these witnesses could recall with startling accuracy every detail that had occurred between seventeen minutes after eight and twentyone minutes past nine on the night of september over a year before but where they had been and what they had done ten minutes earlier or ten minutes later or where they were at nine oclock in the evening last friday they couldnt for the lives of them remember <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even billy had to admit it and when the prosecuting attorney demanded the death penalty the prisoner had an uncanny sensation as of the tightening of a hempen rope about his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he waited for the jury to return its verdict billy sat in his cell trying to read a newspaper which a kindly guard had given him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his eyes persisted in boring through the white paper and the black type to scenes that were not in any paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw a turbulent river tumbling through a savage world and in the swirl of the water lay a little island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he saw a man there upon the island and a girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl was teaching the man to speak the language of the cultured and to view life as people of refinement view it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she taught him what honor meant among her class and that it was better to lose any other possession rather than lose honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy realized that it had been these lessons that had spurred him on to the mad scheme that was to end now with the verdict of guiltyhe had wished to vindicate his honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hard laugh broke from his lips but instantly he sobered and his face softened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been for her sake after all and what mattered it if they did send him to the gallows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not sacrificed his honorhe had done his best to assert it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could kill him but they couldnt make him guilty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a thousand juries pronouncing him so could not make it true that he had killed schneider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it would be hard after all his hopes after all the plans he had made to live square to show them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes still boring through the paper suddenly found themselves attracted by something in the text before thema name harding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marriage of barbara daughter of anthony harding the multimillionaire to william mallory will take place on the twentyfifth of june <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was more but billy did not read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true that he had urged her to marry mallory but now in his lonesomeness and friendlessness he felt almost as though she had been untrue to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come along byrne a bailiff interrupted his thoughts the jurys reached a verdict <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge was emerging from his chambers as billy was led into the courtroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but scarcely had they made half a dozen steps from the edge of the cliff when a bird came fluttering to meet them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the same pretty little bird with the purple wings and body the yellow legs the golden collar round its neck and the crownlike tuft upon its head whose behavior had so much surprised ulysses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it hovered about eurylochus and almost brushed his face with its wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so plaintively intelligent was the sound that it seemed as if the little creature were going to break its heart with some mighty secret that it had to tell and only this one poor note to tell it with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my pretty bird said eurylochusfor he was a wary person and let no token of harm escape his noticemy pretty bird who sent you hither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what is the message which you bring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it flew towards the edge of the cliff and looked around at them as if exceedingly anxious that they should return whence they came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eurylochus and a few of the others were inclined to turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not help suspecting that the purple bird must be aware of something mischievous that would befall them at the palace and the knowledge of which affected its airy spirit with a human sympathy and sorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the rest of the voyagers snuffing up the smoke from the palace kitchen ridiculed the idea of returning to the vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them more brutal than his fellows and the most notorious gormandizer in the crew said such a cruel and wicked thing that i wonder the mere thought did not turn him into a wild beast in shape as he already was in his nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this troublesome and impertinent little fowl said he would make a delicate titbit to begin dinner with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just one plump morsel melting away between the teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he comes within my reach ill catch him and give him to the palace cook to be roasted on a skewer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the words were hardly out of his mouth before the purple bird flew away crying peep peep peweep more dolorously than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant exactly agree that it was the right thing to do but he or some friend acting for him seems to have taken precautions that we are not to suffer or lose money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beecher goes on the theory that all is fair in love and war i suppose and he may call this a sort of scientific war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned wondered as he looked at his chum how much love there was in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clearly beecher was determined to get that idol of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it cant be helped and we must make the best of it said tom after a pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now boys lets have breakfast and then well make what goods we cant take with us as snug as possible until we can send the mule drivers after them went on professor bumper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont suppose im going to let a little thing like this stand between me and the discovery of kurzon and the idol of gold do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon i dont see how oh well find a way interrupted tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt the first time ive been pretty well stranded on an expedition of this kind and sometimes from the same causethe actions of a rival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now well turn the tables on the other fellows and see how they like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom and ned got the meal and then a consultation was held as to what was best to be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found myself without an object to hold my will together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried ewart and got no help from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i regard it all now in this retrospect it seems to me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned aims i discovered myself for the first time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before that i had seen only the world and things in it had sought them selfforgetful of all but my impulse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i found myself grouped with a system of appetites and satisfactions with much work to doand no desire it seemed left in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were moments when i thought of suicide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times my life appeared before me in bleak relentless light a series of ignorances crude blunderings degradation and cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had what the old theologians call a conviction of sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sought salvationnot perhaps in the formula a methodist preacher would recognise but salvation nevertheless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men find their salvation nowadays in many ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> names and forms dont i think matter very much the real need is something that we can hold and that holds one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have known a man find that determining factor in a dryplate factory and another in writing a history of the manor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so long as it holds one it does not matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many men and women nowadays take up some concrete aspect of socialism or social reform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but socialism for me has always been a little bit too human too set about with personalities and foolishness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think im blind to the fun the surprises the jolly little coarsenesses and insufficiency of life to the humour of it as people say and to adventure but that isnt the root of the matter with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stumble and flounder but i know that over all these merry immediate things there are other things that are great and serene very high beautiful thingsthe reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent got it but its there nevertheless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a spiritual guttersnipe in love with unimaginable goddesses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never seen the goddesses nor ever shallbut it takes all the fun out of the mudand at times i fear it takes all the kindliness too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im talking of things i cant expect the reader to understand because i dont half understand them myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is something links things for me a sunset or so a mood or so the high air something there was in marions form and colour something i find and lose in mantegnas pictures something in the lines of these boats i make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should see x my last and i cant explain myself i perceive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it all comes to this that i am a hard and morally limited cad with a mind beyond my merits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally i resist that as a complete solution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow i had a sense of inexorable need of distress and insufficiency that was unendurable and for a time this aeronautical engineering allayed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the end of this particular crisis of which i tell so badly i idealised science <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i decided that in power and knowledge lay the salvation of my life the secret that would fill my need that to these things i would give myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i emerged at last like a man who has been diving in darkness clutching at a new resolve for which he had groped desperately and long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came into the inner office suddenly one dayit must have been just before the time of marions suit for restitutionand sat down before my uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes been a stupid girl george he said i partly understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youre quit of her now practically and theres just as good fish in the sea oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall go amok if i dont get it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a different sort of beast from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel like a man floundering in a universe of soapsuds up and downs east and west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must get my foot on i laughed at the consternation in his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its an old ideai thought of years ago but it came back to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe the time has come for flying to be possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the folk of that country be lightly drunken and have but little appetite to meat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they have commonly the flux of the womb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia be many diverse folk and ethiope is clept cusis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that country be folk that have but one foot and they go so blyve that it is marvel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the foot is so large that it shadoweth all the body against the sun when they will lie and rest them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia when the children be young and little they be all yellow and when that they wax of age that yellowness turneth to be all black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia is the city of saba and the land of the which one of the three kings that presented our lord in bethlehem was king of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from ethiopia men go into ind by many diverse countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ind is divided in three principal parts that is the more that is a full hot country and ind the less that is a full attempre country that stretcheth to the land of media and the three part toward the septentrion is full cold so that for pure cold and continual frost the water becometh crystal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and upon those rocks of crystal grow the good diamonds that be of trouble colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be so hard that no man may polish them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men clepe them diamonds in that country and hamese in another country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other diamonds men find in arabia that be not so good and they be more brown and more tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and other diamonds also men find in the isle of cyprus that be yet more tender and them men may well polish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the land of macedonia men find diamonds also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the best and the most precious be in ind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men find many times hard diamonds in a mass that cometh out of gold when men pure it and refine it out of the mine when men break that mass in small pieces and sometime it happens that men find some as great as a peas and some less and they be as hard as those of ind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and albeit that men find good diamonds in ind yet nevertheless men find them more commonly upon the rocks in the sea and upon hills where the mine of gold is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they grow many together one little another great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there be some of the greatness of a bean and some as great as an hazel nut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be square and pointed of their own kind both above and beneath without working of mans hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be nourished with the dew of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they engender commonly and bring forth small children that multiply and grow all the year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have oftentimes assayed that if a man keep them with a little of the rock and wet them with maydew oftsithes they shall grow every year and the small will wax great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for right as the fine pearl congealeth and waxeth great of the dew of heaven right so doth the very diamond and right as the pearl of his own kind taketh roundness right so the diamond by virtue of god taketh squareness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does a train vanish into thin air in england in broad daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an engine a tender two carriages a van five human beingsand all lost on a straight line of railway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unless we get something positive within the next hour ill take inspector collins and go down myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then at last something positive did occur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took the shape of another telegram from kenyon junction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> regret to report that the dead body of john slater driver of the special train has just been found among the gorse bushes at a point two and a quarter miles from the junction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had fallen from his engine pitched down the embankment and rolled among the bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> injuries to his head from the fall appear to be cause of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ground has now been carefully examined and there is no trace of the missing train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the country was as has already been stated in the throes of a political crisis and the attention of the public was further distracted by the important and sensational developments in paris where a huge scandal threatened to destroy the government and to wreck the reputations of many of the leading men in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the papers were full of these events and the singular disappearance of the special train attracted less attention than would have been the case in more peaceful times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grotesque nature of the event helped to detract from its importance for the papers were disinclined to believe the facts as reported to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more than one of the london journals treated the matter as an ingenious hoax until the coroners inquest upon the unfortunate driver an inquest which elicited nothing of importance convinced them of the tragedy of the incident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bland accompanied by inspector collins the senior detective officer in the service of the company went down to kenyon junction the same evening and their research lasted throughout the following day but was attended with purely negative results <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only was no trace found of the missing train but no conjecture could be put forward which could possibly explain the facts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time inspector collinss official report which lies before me as i write served to show that the possibilities were more numerous than might have been expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the stretch of railway between these two points said he the country is dotted with ironworks and collieries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of these some are being worked and some have been abandoned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are no fewer than twelve which have smallgauge lines which run trolly cars down to the main line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man who was standing the anchorwatch ran down the gangway and hauled him out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was what he wanted to get aboard the ship and the next thing he expected was to be taken on deck and then below to warm up and dry out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the captain inhospitably kept him perched on the lowest gangway step shivering miserably and with his feet dangling in the water till we out of very pity rowed in from the darkness and took him off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jokes and gibes of the awakened crew sounded anything but sweet in our ears and even the two italians climbed up on the rail and laughed down at us long and maliciously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats all right charley said in a low voice which i only could hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im mighty glad its not us thats laughing first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well save our laugh to the end eh lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clapped a hand on my shoulder as he finished but it seemed to me that there was more determination than hope in his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have been possible for us to secure the aid of united states marshals and board the english ship backed by government authority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the instructions of the fish commission were to the effect that the patrolmen should avoid complications and this one did we call on the higher powers might well end in a pretty international tangle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused and as he made no answer went on still smiling i do read sometimes you know and im very fond of margaret aubyns books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was reading pomegranate seed when we first met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was then you told me all about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard had turned back into the room and stood staring at his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he repeated and with the words remembrance came to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had found miss trent one afternoon with the novel in her hand and moved by the lovers fatuous impulse to associate himself in some way with whatever fills the mind of the beloved had broken through his habitual silence about the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rewarded by the consciousness of figuring impressively in miss trents imagination he had gone on from one anecdote to another reviving dormant details of his old hillbridge life and pasturing his vanity on the eagerness with which she received his reminiscences of a being already clothed in the impersonality of greatness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the incident had left no trace in his mind but it sprang up now like an old enemy the more dangerous for having been forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> absolute rest for two months declared jennings mildred gave a resigned sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is much inveighing against hypocrisy a vice unsightly rather than desperately wicked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the excitement about it its dangerous even deadly near kinsman selfdeception escapes unassailed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seven cardinal sins but what of the eighth?the parent of all the others the one beside which the children seem almost white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the first few weeks mildred had been careful about spending money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> economy she did not understand how could she when she had never had a lesson in it or a valuable hint about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only way in which such people can keep order in their finances is by not spending any money at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this so long as she gave her whole mind to her work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after the first great cold so depressing so subtly undermining she began to go about to think of to need and to buy clothes to spend money in a dozen necessary ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all she was simply borrowing the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she would be making a career would be earning large sums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stanley meant for her to use the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how would her career be helped by her going about looking a dowd and a frump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had always been used to the comforts of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she deprived herself of them she would surely get into a frame of mind where her work would suffer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she must lead the normal life of a woman of her class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to work all the timewhy as jennings said that took away all the freshness made one stale and unfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little distractionalways of course with musical people people who talked and thought and did musicthat sort of distraction was quite as much a part of her education as the singing lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley certainly a sensible and serious woman if ever there was onemrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley believed so and it must be so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that illness and before she began to go about she had fallen into several fits of hideous blues had been in despair as to the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as she saw something of peoplealways the valuable musical sort of peopleher spirits improved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she got a few new dressesvery simple and inexpensive but stylish and charmingand the hats too were successful as soon as she was freshly arrayed she was singing better and was talking hopefully of the career again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes it was really necessary that she live as she had always been used to living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when stanley came back her account was drawn up to the last cent of the proportionate amount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact it might have been a few dollarsa hundred or so overdrawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the summer she would spend less and by fall she would be far ahead againand ready to no indeed cried she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been living within the hundred a weekor nearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why three or four nights of singing will i suppose i will make a lot of money said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hastily added i dont mean the career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can hardly wait to begin at the roles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i never earned well youll have plenty of it in two or three years said stanley confidently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you mustnt try to live like girls whove been brought up to hardship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt necessary and it would only unfit you for your i think thats true said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the legend goes that after the crucifixion his conscience troubled him and he fled from jerusalem and wandered about the earth weary of life and a prey to tortures of the mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eventually he hid himself away on the heights of mount pilatus and dwelt alone among the clouds and crags for years but rest and peace were still denied him presently we passed the place where a man of better odor was born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the childrens friend santa claus or st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some unaccountable reputations in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has ranked for ages as the peculiar friend of children yet it appears he was not much of a friend to his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had ten of them and when fifty years old he left them and sought out as dismal a refuge from the world as possible and became a hermit in order that he might reflect upon pious themes without being disturbed by the joyous and other judging by pilate and st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholas there exists no rule for the construction of hermits they seem made out of all kinds of material <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but pilate attended to the matter of expiating his sin while he was alive whereas st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholas will probably have to go on climbing down sooty chimneys christmas eve forever and conferring kindness on other peoples children to make up for deserting his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his bones are kept in a church in a village sachseln which we visited and are naturally held in great reverence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his portrait is common in the farmhouses of the region but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during his hermit life according to legend he partook of the bread and wine of the communion once a month a constant marvel with us as we sped along the bases of the steep mountains on this journey was not that avalanches occur but that they are not occurring all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one does not understand why rocks and landslides do not plunge down these declivities daily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a landslip occurred three quarters of a century ago on the route from arth to brunnen which was a formidable thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mass of conglomerate two miles long a thousand feet broad and a hundred feet thick broke away from a cliff three thousand feet high and hurled itself into the valley below we had such a beautiful day and such endless pictures of limpid lakes and green hills and valleys and majestic mountains and milky cataracts dancing down the steeps and gleaming in the sun that we could not help feeling sweet toward all the world so we tried to drink all the milk and eat all the grapes and apricots and berries and buy all the bouquets of wild flowers which the little peasant boys and girls offered for sale at short distancesand they were entirely too shortall along the road were groups of neat and comely children with their wares nicely and temptingly set forth in the grass under the shade trees and as soon as we approached they swarmed into the road holding out their baskets and milk bottles and ran beside the carriage barefoot and bareheaded and importuned us to buy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seldom desisted early but continued to run and insistbeside the wagon while they could and behind it until they lost breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they turned and chased a returning carriage back to their tradingpost again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after several hours of this without any intermission it becomes almost annoying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know what we should have done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however there were plenty of these loaded with dusty tourists and piled high with luggage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed from lucerne to interlaken we had the spectacle among other scenery of an unbroken procession of our talk was mostly anticipatory of what we should see on the downgrade of the brunig by and by after we should pass the summit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all our friends in lucerne had said that to look down upon meiringen and the rushing bluegray river aar and the broad level green valley and across at the mighty alpine precipices that rise straight up to the clouds out of that valley and up at the microscopic chalets perched upon the dizzy eaves of those precipices and winking dimly and fitfully through the drifting veil of vapor and still up and up at the superb oltschiback and the other beautiful cascades that leap from those rugged heights robed in powdery spray ruffled with foam and girdled with rainbowsto look upon these things they say was to look upon the last possibility of the sublime and the enchanting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore as i say we talked mainly of these coming wonders if we were conscious of any impatience it was to get there in favorable season if we felt any anxiety it was that the day might remain perfect and enable us to see those marvels at their best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we approached the kaiserstuhl a part of the harness gave way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in distress for a moment but only a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the foreandaft gear that was brokenthe thing that leads aft from the forward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the wagon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in america this would have been a heavy leathern strap but all over the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the size of your little fingerclothesline is what it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cabs use it private carriages freightcarts and wagons all sorts of vehicles have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in munich i afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fiftyfour halfbarrels of beer i had before noticed that the cabs in heidelberg used itnot new rope but rope that had been in use since abrahams time and i had felt nervous sometimes behind it when the cab was tearing down a hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after reloading we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush a ball whistled close past my ear and poor tom redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both the squire and i returned the shot but as we had nothing to aim at it is probable we only wasted powder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain and gray were already examining him and i saw with half an eye that all was over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried groaning and bleeding into the loghouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor old fellow he had not uttered one word of surprise complaint fear or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now when we had laid him down in the loghouse to die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had lain like a trojan behind his mattress in the gallery he had followed every order silently doggedly and well he was the oldest of our party by a score of years and now sullen old serviceable servant it was he that was to die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand crying like a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom my man said i youre going home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i had had a lick at them with the gun first he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom said the squire say you forgive me wont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would that be respectful like from me to you squire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a little while of silence he said he thought somebody might read a prayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and not long after without another word he passed away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime the captain whom i had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets had turned out a great many various storesthe british colours a bible a coil of stoutish rope pen ink the logbook and pounds of tobacco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chancing to meet alton granger on the street to whom never before had he mentioned the ten dollars loaned him in he reminded alton granger of the little affair and was promptly paid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also of all unbelievable men to be in funds he so found the town drunkard for whom he had bought many a drink in the old and palmy days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from him john tarwater borrowed a dollar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he took the afternoon train to san francisco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dozen days later carrying a halfempty canvas sack of blankets and old clothes he landed on the beach of dyea in the thick of the great klondike rush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten thousand tons of outfit lay heaped and scattered and twice ten thousand men struggled with it and clamoured about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freight by indianback over chilcoot to lake linderman had jumped from sixteen to thirty cents a pound which latter was a rate of six hundred dollars a ton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the subarctic winter gloomed near at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all knew it and all knew that of the twenty thousand of them very few would get across the passes leaving the rest to winter and wait for the late spring thaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such the beach old john tarwater stepped upon and straight across the beach and up the trail toward chilcoot he headed cackling his ancient chant a very grandfather argus himself with no outfit worry in the world for he did not possess any outfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night he slept on the flats five miles above dyea at the head of canoe navigation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the dyea river became a rushing mountain torrent plunging out of a dark canyon from the glaciers that fed it far above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had turned away to the window and stood staring out into the downpour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you hadnt thought of its being miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should i have thought of miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see now why i wanted so much to find out what you knew about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made no comment and she pursued now that you do know its she if theres anything he moved back into the room and went up to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was serious with a slight shade of annoyance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i told you ive never in my life heard any one say two words about miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anna made no answer and they continued to face each other without moving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the moment she had ceased to think about sophy viner and owen the only thought in her mind was that darrow was alone with her close to her and that for the first time their hands and lips had not met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hesitated as if waiting for him to urge her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to go at once to my mother inlawowens just been telling her she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that accounts for my having on my way up heard some one telephoning for miss painter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the allusion they laughed together vaguely and anna moved toward the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held it open for her and followed her out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left her at the door of madame de chantelles sitting room and plunged out alone into the rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind flung about the stripped treetops of the avenue and dashed the stinging streams into his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked to the gate and then turned into the highroad and strode along in the open buffeted by slanting gusts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the evenly ridged fields were a blurred waste of mud and the russet coverts which he and owen had shot through the day before shivered desolately against a driving sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow walked on and on indifferent to the direction he was taking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annas announcement had not come to him as a complete surprise that morning as he strolled back to the house with owen leath and miss viner he had had a momentary intuition of the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it had been no more than an intuition the merest faint cloudpuff of surmise and now it was an attested fact darkening over the whole sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in respect of his own attitude he saw at once that the discovery made no appreciable change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had been bound to silence before he was no less bound to it now the only difference lay in the fact that what he had just learned had rendered his bondage more intolerable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hitherto he had felt for sophy viners defenseless state a sympathy profoundly tinged with compunction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now he was halfconscious of an obscure indignation against her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> superior as he had fancied himself to readymade judgments he was aware of cherishing the common doubt as to the disinterestedness of the woman who tries to rise above her past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder she had been sick with fear on meeting him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in his power to do her more harm than he had dreamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was past any effort of the kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think he heard me even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his long wet hair plastered over the face concealed his features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond stretching out his arms like an infant imploring help he made no effort to save himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seized him firmly by the collar unfortunately with my right hand leaving only my left to stem the torrent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how to keep his face out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at every stroke i was losing strength we were being swept away for him to hopeless death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length i touched bottom got both hands under his head and held it above the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still breathed still puffed the hair from his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was still a hope if i could but maintain my footing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each instant i was losing ground each instant i was driven back foot by foot towards the gulf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water at first only up to my chest was now up to my shoulders now up to my neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my arms ached till they could bear no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell like lead till his back lay stretched upon the rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his arms were spread out so that his body formed a cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i paddled above it in the clear smooth water gazing at his familiar face till two or three large bubbles burst upon the surface then hardly knowing what i was doing floated mechanically from the trappers grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first the right or western bank being within sixty or seventy yards being also my proper goal i struck out for it with mere eagerness to land as soon as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well then i would take it quietly not try to cross direct but swim on gently keeping my head that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees i got within twenty yards of the bank was counting joyfully on the rest which a few more strokes would bring me when wsh came a current and swept me right into the middle of the stream again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must get out of this somehow or another better on the wrong side than not at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i let myself go and made for the shore we had started from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when well over to the left bank i was carried out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my flannel shirt stuck to and impeded me i would have it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got it over my head but hadnt unbuttoned the studs it stuck partly over my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got a drop of water into my windpipe was choking tugged till i got the shirt right again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tried floating on my back to cough and get my breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was setting in glorious red and gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i noticed this noticed the salmon rolling like porpoises around me and thought of william with his rod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strangest of all for i had not noticed her before little cream was still struggling for dear life not a hundred yards below me sometimes sinking sometimes reappearing but on her way to join her master as surely as i thought that i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in my distress the predominant thought was the loneliness of my fate the loneliness of my body after death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not a living thing to see me die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time i felt not fear but loss of hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could only beat the water with feeble and futile splashes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as we all then do i prayed prayed for strength prayed that i might be spared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could but just keep my nose or mouth above it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my legs sank and my feet touched bottom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant as if from an electric shock a flush of energy suffused my brain and limbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood upright in an almost tranquil pool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an eddy had lodged me on a sandbank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between it and the land was scarcely twenty yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through this gap the stream ran strong as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> queried flavia with that fervid enthusiasm with which she could on occasion utter things simply incomprehensible for their banalityat her feats of this sort miss broadwood was wont to sit breathless with admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madam while the intellect was undeniably present in the performances of those women it was only the stick of the rocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although this woman has eluded me i have studied her conditions and perturbances as astronomers conjecture the orbits of planets they have never seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she exists she is probably neither an artist nor a woman with a mission but an obscure personage with imperative intellectual needs who absorbs rather than produces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia still nodding nervously fixed a strained glance of interrogation upon m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you think she would be a woman whose first necessity would be to know whose instincts would be satisfied only with the best who could draw from others appreciative merely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the novelist lifted his dull eyes to his interlocutress with an untranslatable smile and a slight inclination of his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exactly so you are really remarkable madam he added in a tone of cold astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after dinner the guests took their coffee in the music room where schemetzkin sat down at the piano to drum ragtime and give his celebrated imitation of the boardingschool girls execution of chopin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flatly refused to play anything more serious and would practice only in the morning when he had the music room to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roux repaired to the smoking room to discuss the necessity of extending the tax on manufactured articles in franceone of those conversations which particularly exasperated flavia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after schemetzkin had grimaced and tortured the keyboard with malicious vulgarities for half an hour signor donati to put an end to his torture consented to sing and flavia and imogen went to fetch arthur to play his accompaniments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hamilton rose with an annoyed look and placed his cigarette on the mantel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why yes flavia ill accompany him provided he sings something with a melody italian arias or ballads and provided the recital is not interminable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you but i have some letters to write replied the novelist bowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as flavia had remarked to imogen arthur really played accompaniments remarkably well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to hear him recalled vividly the days of her childhood when he always used to spend his business vacations at her mothers home in maine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had possessed for her that almost hypnotic influence which young men sometimes exert upon little girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a sort of phantom love affair subjective and fanciful a precocity of instinct like that tender and maternal concern which some little girls feel for their dolls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet this childish infatuation is capable of all the depressions and exaltations of love itself it has its bitter jealousies cruel disappointments its exacting caprices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew the crockery was china said i and naturally enough supposed what was written upon it to be chinese as for there being such a language the english have a language the french have a language and why not the chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said i i know a little of two or three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes a little welsh and a little haik <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am glad to see you in my house said the old man shaking me by the hand how singular that one coming as you did should know armenian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not more singular said i than that one living in such a place as this should know chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man looked at me and sighed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg pardon said i for asking what is perhaps an impertinent question i have not imitated your own delicacy you have never asked me a question without first desiring permission and here i have been days and nights in your house an intruder on your hospitality and you have never so much as asked me who i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in forbearing to do that said the old man i merely obeyed the chinese precept ask no questions of a guest it is written on both sides of the teapot out of which you have had your tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have reason to think so said the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been occupied upon it fiveandthirty years and i am still very imperfectly acquainted with it at least i frequently find upon my crockery sentences the meaning of which to me is very dark though it is true these sentences are mostly verses which are of course more difficult to understand than mere prose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are your chinese studies said i confined to crockery literature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> entirely said the old man i read nothing else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard said i that the chinese have no letters but that for every word they have a separate character is it so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for every word they have a particular character said the old man though to prevent confusion they have arranged their words under two hundred and fourteen what we should call radicals but which they call keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we arrange all our words in a dictionary under twentyfour letters so do they arrange all their words or characters under two hundred and fourteen radical signs the simplest radicals being the first and the more complex the last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does the chinese resemble any of the european languages in words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am scarcely competent to inform you said the old man but i believe not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i pointing to one on the vase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a knife said the old man that character is one of the simplest radicals or keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a strange word for a knife is it not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were never at school at edinburgh i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that accounts for your not knowing the meaning of tawse said i had you received the rudiments of a classical education at the high school you would have known the meaning of tawse full well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a leathern thong with which refractory urchins are recalled to a sense of their duty by the dominie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot see what the two words have in common except a slight agreement in sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw a handsome young fellow and wanted him for her husband her father who could refuse her nothing consented and now behold the result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had lingered longer at the window than he had meant to do perhaps because he could see that the young woman was talking with some person in a back room the door of which stood open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chupin tried to find out who this person was but he did not succeed and he was about to go in when suddenly he saw madame paul rise from her seat and say a few words with an air of displeasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this time her eyes instead of turning to the open door were fixed on a part of the shop directly opposite her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there some one there as well then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he changed his post of observation and by standing on tiptoe he succeeded in distinguishing a puny little boy some three or four years old and clad in rags who was playing with the remnants of a toyhorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight of this child increased chupins indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rascal not only deserts his wife but he leaves his child to starve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we may as well make a note of that and when we settle up our accounts he shall pay dearly for his villainy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this threat he brusquely entered the shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he handed her the missive which florent had confided to his care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame paul took hold of it with some hesitation eying the messenger suspiciously meanwhile but on seeing the handwriting she uttered a cry of surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and turning toward the open door she called m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its from himits from my husband from paul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a baldheaded corpulent man who looked some fifty years of age now timidly emerged from the room behind the shop with a cap in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear child he said in an oily voice what was i telling you just now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything comes to those who know how to wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however she had already broken the seal and she was now reading the letter eagerly clapping her hands with delight as she finished its perusal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes frightenedhe begs me to wait a littlelookread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mouchon could not read without his spectacles and he lost at least two minutes in searching his pockets before he found them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when they were adjusted the light was so dim that it took him at least three minutes more to decipher the missive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chupin had spent this time in scrutinizingin appraising the man as it were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a middle class man thats evident from his linen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes marriedtheres a weddingring on his finger he has a daughter for the ends of his necktie are embroidered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lives in the neighborhood for well dressed as he is he wears a cap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what was he doing there in that back room in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answered madame paul as she took up the letter and read it again with her eyes sparkling with joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must strike the iron while its hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he promises me to promise and to keep ones promises are two different things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him but he stopped short calling her attention with a gesture to the messenger whose eyes were glittering with intense curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how wretched and poor and neglected they seem she said as the cab rattled along the mile end road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you suppose i dont know a slaves face when i see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont their masters see that theyre better fed and better no one answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wagesystem of modern england is a little difficult to explain in three words even if you understand itwhich the children didnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have a revolt of your slaves if youre not careful said the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no said cyril you see they have votesthat makes them safe not to revolt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do i dont know said the harassed cyril its just a vote i see said the queen a sort of plaything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i wish that all these slaves may have in their hands this moment their fill instantly all the people in the mile end road and in all the other streets where poor people live found their hands full of things to eat and drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the cab window could be seen persons carrying every kind of food and bottles and cans as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roast meat fowls red lobsters great yellowy crabs fried fish boiled pork beefsteak puddings baked onions mutton pies most of the young people had oranges and sweets and cake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made an enormous change in the look of the mile end roadbrightened it up so to speak and brightened up more than you can possibly imagine the faces of the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the best wish youve had yet said jane with cordial approval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint agoin to drive you no further he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wants my tea he said and they saw that on the box of the cab was a mound of cabbage with pork chops and apple sauce a duck and a spotted currant pudding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the scornful macduff we will have a show of thee as men show monsters and a painted board on which shall be written never said macbeth whose courage returned with despair i will not live to kiss the ground before young malcolms feet and to be baited with the curses of the rabble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though birnam wood be come to dunsinane and thou opposed to me who west never born of woman yet will i try the last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with these frantic words he threw himself upon macduff who after a severe struggle in the end overcame him and cutting off his head made a present of it to the young and lawful king malcolm who took upon him the government which by the machinations of the usurper he had so long been deprived of and ascended the throne of duncan the meek amid the acclamations of the nobles and the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram count of rousillon had newly come to his title and estate by the death of his father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of france loved the father of bertram and when he heard of his death he sent for his son to come immediately to his royal court in paris intending for the friendship he bore the late count to grace young bertram with his especial favour and protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram was living with his mother the widowed countess when lafeu an old lord of the french court came to conduct him to the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of france was an absolute monarch and the invitation to court was in the form of a royal mandate or positive command which no subject of what high dignity soever might disobey therefore though the countess in parting with this dear son seemed a second time to bury her husband whose loss she had so lately mourned yet she dared not to keep him a single day but gave instant orders for his departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lafeu who came to fetch him tried to comfort the countess for the loss of her late lord and her sons sudden absence and he said in a courtiers flattering manner that the king was so kind a prince she would find in his majesty a husband and that he would be a father to her son meaning only that the good king would befriend the fortunes of bertram <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lafeu told the countess that the king had fallen into a sad malady which was pronounced by his physicians to be incurable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady expressed great sorrow on hearing this account of the kings ill health and said she wished the father of helena a young gentlewoman who was present in attendance upon her were living for that she doubted not he could have cured his majesty of his disease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gave her a sort of innocent attention and the best smiles many of them had smiled for long there were few tears in clara but people smiled mistyeyed at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very occasionally amory stayed for little halfhours after the rest of the court had gone and they would have bread and jam and tea late in the afternoon or maplesugar lunches as she called them at night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amory was becoming trite from where he perched in the centre of the diningroom table one six oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was searching out napkins in the sideboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of those people who have no interest in anything but their children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked her the one thing that he knew might embarrass her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the remark that the first bore made to adam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she gave the answer that adam must have given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but eventually adam probably told the bore all the things he thought about at night when the locusts sang in the sandy grass and he must have remarked patronizingly how different he was from eve forgetting how different she was from him at any rate clara told amory much about herself that evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had had a harried life from sixteen on and her education had stopped sharply with her leisure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> browsing in her library amory found a tattered gray book out of which fell a yellow sheet that he impudently opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a poem that she had written at school about a gray convent wall on a gray day and a girl with her cloak blown by the wind sitting atop of it and thinking about the manycolored world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a rule such sentiment bored him but this was done with so much simplicity and atmosphere that it brought a picture of clara to his mind of clara on such a cool gray day with her keen blue eyes staring out trying to see her tragedies come marching over the gardens outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he would have loved to have come along and seen her on the wall and talked nonsense or romance to her perched above him in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to be frightfully jealous of everything about clara of her past of her babies of the men and women who flocked to drink deep of her cool kindness and rest their tired minds as at an absorbing play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about half the world do she admitted but i think thats a pretty good average dont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she turned to find something in browning that bore on the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was the only person he ever met who could look up passages and quotations to show him in the middle of the conversation and yet not be irritating to distraction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did it constantly with such a serious enthusiasm that he grew fond of watching her golden hair bent over a book brow wrinkled ever so little at hunting her sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through early march he took to going to philadelphia for weekends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost always there was some one else there and she seemed not anxious to see him alone for many occasions presented themselves when a word from her would have given him another delicious halfhour of adoration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he fell gradually in love and began to speculate wildly on marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though this design flowed through his brain even to his lips still he knew afterward that the desire had not been deeply rooted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once he dreamt that it had come true and woke up in a cold panic for in his dream she had been a silly flaxen clara with the gold gone out of her hair and platitudes falling insipidly from her changeling tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he doesnt often come and talk to us now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has to spend all his time thinking about his business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent done any harm this time children rather good than is he a friend of yours father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is an acquaintance said my father frowning a little we have done some business together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this letter he stopped and then said no you didnt do any harm today but i want you for the future not to do anything so serious as to try to buy a partnership without consulting me thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to interfere with your plays and pleasures but you will consult me of course we said we should be delighted but then alice who was father said i havent much time to be with you for my business takes most of my time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is an anxious business but i cant he looked so sad we all said we liked being alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then alice said we dont mean that exactly father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is rather lonely sometimes since mother died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we were all quiet a little while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father stayed with us till we went to bed and when he said good night he looked quite cheerful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we told him so and he said well the fact is that letter took a weight off my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant think what he meant but i am sure the g <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would be pleased if he could know he had taken a weight off somebodys mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is that sort of man i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not quite such good scent as we thought it would be but we had fifteen shillings and they were all good so is the g <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and until those fifteen shillings were spent we felt almost as jolly as though our fortunes had been properly restored <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do not notice your general fortune so much as long as you have money in your pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the name of the boy was missing from some of the lists and for two days it was reported that he had perished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> less than hours after the cunard line steamship carpathia came in as a rescue ship with survivors of the titanic disaster she sailed again for the mediterranean cruise which she originally started upon last week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bride the second marconi wireless operator of the titanic who had both of his legs crushed on a lifeboat was carried off on the shoulders of the ships officers to st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rostron of the carpathia addressed an official report giving his account of the carpathias rescue work to the general manager of the cunard line liverpool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the report read i beg to report that at a <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was informed of urgent message from titanic with her position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i immediately ordered ship turned around and put her in course for that position we being then miles s <end> <end> 
<start> <start> t from her had heads of all departments called and issued what i considered the necessary orders to be in preparation for any emergency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> saw flare half a point on port bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking this for granted to be ship shortly after we sighted our first iceberg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had previously had lookouts doubled knowing that titanic had struck ice and so took every care and precaution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we soon found ourselves in a field of bergs and had to alter course several times to clear bergs weather fine and clear light air on sea beautifully clear night though dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus doing distance in three hours and a half picking up the first boat at a <end> <end>

<start> <start> all survivors aboard and all boats accounted for viz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fifteen lifeboats one boat abandoned two berthon boats alongside saw one floating upwards among wreckage and according to second officer senior officer saved one berthon boat had not been launched it having got jammed making sixteen lifeboats and four berthon boats accounted for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time we had cleared first boat it was breaking day and i could see all within area of four miles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we also saw that we were surrounded by icebergs large and small huge field of drift ice with large and small bergs in it the ice field trending from n <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as far as we could see either way <end> <end>
