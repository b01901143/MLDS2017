<start> <start> swinging through the trees with great speed he reached the point only a moment after the ship had passed out of the harbor so that he obtained an excellent view of the wonders of this strange floating house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were some twenty men running hither and thither about the deck pulling and hauling on ropes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a light land breeze was blowing and the ship had been worked through the harbors mouth under scant sail but now that they had cleared the point every available shred of canvas was being spread that she might stand out to sea as handily as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan watched the graceful movements of the ship in rapt admiration and longed to be aboard her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently his keen eyes caught the faintest suspicion of smoke on the far northern horizon and he wondered over the cause of such a thing out on the great water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about the same time the lookout on the arrow must have discerned it for in a few minutes tarzan saw the sails being shifted and shortened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ship came about and presently he knew that she was beating back toward land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man at the bows was constantly heaving into the sea a rope to the end of which a small object was fastened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan wondered what the purpose of this action might be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the ship came up directly into the wind the anchor was lowered down came the sails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was great scurrying about on deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a boat was lowered and in it a great chest was placed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a dozen sailors bent to the oars and pulled rapidly toward the point where tarzan crouched in the branches of a tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the stern of the boat as it drew nearer tarzan saw the ratfaced man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was but a few minutes later that the boat touched the beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men jumped out and lifted the great chest to the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were on the north side of the point so that their presence was concealed from those at the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men argued angrily for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the ratfaced one with several companions ascended the low bluff on which stood the tree that concealed tarzan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they looked about for several minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is a good place said the ratfaced sailor indicating a spot beneath tarzans tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is as good as any replied one of his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they catch us with the treasure aboard it will all be confiscated anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we might as well bury it here on the chance that some of us will escape the gallows to come back and enjoy it later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ratfaced one now called to the men who had remained at the boat and they came slowly up the bank carrying picks and shovels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> retorted one of the men in a surly tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre no admiral you damned shrimp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im capn here though ill have you to understand you swab shrieked snipes with a volley of frightful oaths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steady boys cautioned one of the men who had not spoken before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it aint goin to get us nothing by fightin amongst ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right enough replied the sailor who had resented snipes autocratic tones but it aint agoin to get nobody nothin to put on airs in this bloomin company neither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you fellows dig here said snipes indicating a spot beneath the tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and while youre diggin peter kin be amakin of a map of the location sos we kin find it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you tom and bill take a couple more down and fetch up the chest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wot are you agoin to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked he of the previous altercation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt think your capn was agoin to dig with a shovel did you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men all looked up angrily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of them liked snipes and this disagreeable show of authority since he had murdered king the real head and ringleader of the mutineers had only added fuel to the flames of their hatred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to say that you dont intend to take a shovel and lend a hand with this work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your shoulders not hurt so allfired bad as that said tarrant the sailor who had before spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not by a damned sight replied snipes fingering the butt of his revolver nervously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then by god replied tarrant if you wont take a shovel youll take a pickax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the words he raised his pick above his head and with a mighty blow he buried the point in snipes brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment the men stood silently looking at the result of their fellows grim humor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> served the skunk jolly well right he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the others commenced to ply his pick to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the soil was soft and he threw aside the pick and grasped a shovel then the others joined him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no further comment on the killing but the men worked in a better frame of mind than they had since snipes had assumed command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they had a trench of ample size to bury the chest tarrant suggested that they enlarge it and inter snipes body on top of the chest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might elp fool any as appened to be diggin ereabouts he explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others saw the cunning of the suggestion and so the trench was lengthened to accommodate the corpse and in the center a deeper hole was excavated for the box which was first wrapped in sailcloth and then lowered to its place which brought its top about a foot below the bottom of the grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> earth was shovelled in and tramped down about the chest until the bottom of the grave showed level and uniform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two of the men rolled the ratfaced corpse unceremoniously into the grave after first stripping it of its weapons and various other articles which the several members of the party coveted for their own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they then filled the grave with earth and tramped upon it until it would hold no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the balance of the loose earth was thrown far and wide and a mass of dead undergrowth spread in as natural a manner as possible over the newmade grave to obliterate all signs of the ground having been disturbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their work done the sailors returned to the small boat and pulled off rapidly toward the arrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the breeze had increased considerably and as the smoke upon the horizon was now plainly discernible in considerable volume the mutineers lost no time in getting under full sail and bearing away toward the southwest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan an interested spectator of all that had taken place sat speculating on the strange actions of these peculiar creatures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than the beasts of the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how fortunate was he who lived in the peace and security of the great forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan wondered what the chest they had buried contained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they did not want it why did they not merely throw it into the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would have been much easier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah he thought but they do want it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have hidden it here because they intend returning for it later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan dropped to the ground and commenced to examine the earth about the excavation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was looking to see if these creatures had dropped anything which he might like to own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon he discovered a spade hidden by the underbrush which they had laid upon the grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seized it and attempted to use it as he had seen the sailors do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was awkward work and hurt his bare feet but he persevered until he had partially uncovered the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this he dragged from the grave and laid to one side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he continued digging until he had unearthed the chest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this also he dragged to the side of the corpse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he filled in the smaller hole below the grave replaced the body and the earth around and above it covered it over with underbrush and returned to the chest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four sailors had sweated beneath the burden of its weight tarzan of the apes picked it up as though it had been an empty packing case and with the spade slung to his back by a piece of rope carried it off into the densest part of the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not well negotiate the trees with his awkward burden but he kept to the trails and so made fairly good time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for several hours he traveled a little north of east until he came to an impenetrable wall of matted and tangled vegetation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he took to the lower branches and in another fifteen minutes he emerged into the amphitheater of the apes where they met in council or to celebrate the rites of the dumdum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the center of the clearing and not far from the drum or altar he commenced to dig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was harder work than turning up the freshly excavated earth at the grave but tarzan of the apes was persevering and so he kept at his labor until he was rewarded by seeing a hole sufficiently deep to receive the chest and effectually hide it from view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why had he gone to all this labor without knowing the value of the contents of the chest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan of the apes had a mans figure and a mans brain but he was an ape by training and environment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his brain told him that the chest contained something valuable or the men would not have hidden it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his training had taught him to imitate whatever was new and unusual and now the natural curiosity which is as common to men as to apes prompted him to open the chest and examine its contents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the heavy lock and massive iron bands baffled both his cunning and his immense strength so that he was compelled to bury the chest without having his curiosity satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time tarzan had hunted his way back to the vicinity of the cabin feeding as he went it was quite dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within the little building a light was burning for clayton had found an unopened tin of oil which had stood intact for twenty years a part of the supplies left with the claytons by black michael <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lamps also were still useable and thus the interior of the cabin appeared as bright as day to the astonished tarzan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had often wondered at the exact purpose of the lamps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his reading and the pictures had told him what they were but he had no idea of how they could be made to produce the wondrous sunlight that some of his pictures had portrayed them as diffusing upon all surrounding objects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he approached the window nearest the door he saw that the cabin had been divided into two rooms by a rough partition of boughs and sailcloth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the front room were the three men the two older deep in argument while the younger tilted back against the wall on an improvised stool was deeply engrossed in reading one of tarzans books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan was not particularly interested in the men however so he sought the other window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was writing at tarzans own table beneath the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon a pile of grasses at the far side of the room lay the negress asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an hour tarzan feasted his eyes upon her while she wrote <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he longed to speak to her but he dared not attempt it for he was convinced that like the young man she would not understand him and he feared too that he might frighten her away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length she arose leaving her manuscript upon the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went to the bed upon which had been spread several layers of soft grasses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she loosened the soft mass of golden hair which crowned her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a shimmering waterfall turned to burnished metal by a dying sun it fell about her oval face in waving lines below her waist it tumbled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she extinguished the lamp and all within the cabin was wrapped in cimmerian darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> creeping close beneath the window he waited listening for half an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he was rewarded by the sounds of the regular breathing within which denotes sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cautiously he intruded his hand between the meshes of the lattice until his whole arm was within the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carefully he felt upon the desk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he grasped the manuscript upon which jane porter had been writing and as cautiously withdrew his arm and hand holding the precious treasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan folded the sheets into a small parcel which he tucked into the quiver with his arrows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he melted away into the jungle as softly and as noiselessly as a shadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early the following morning tarzan awoke and his first thought of the new day as the last of yesterday was of the wonderful writing which lay hidden in his quiver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hurriedly he brought it forth hoping against hope that he could read what the beautiful white girl had written there the preceding evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the first glance he suffered a bitter disappointment never before had he so yearned for anything as now he did for the ability to interpret a message from that goldenhaired divinity who had come so suddenly and so unexpectedly into his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what did it matter if the message were not intended for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an expression of her thoughts and that was sufficient for tarzan of the apes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now to be baffled by strange uncouth characters the like of which he had never seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why they even tipped in the opposite direction from all that he had ever examined either in printed books or the difficult script of the few letters he had found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the little bugs of the black book were familiar friends though their arrangement meant nothing to him but these bugs were new and unheard of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for twenty minutes he pored over them when suddenly they commenced to take familiar though distorted shapes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah they were his old friends but badly crippled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he began to make out a word here and a word there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could read it and he would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in another half hour he was progressing rapidly and but for an exceptional word now and again he found it very plain sailing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> west coast of africa about x degrees south latitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seems foolish to write you a letter that you may never see but i simply must tell somebody of our awful experiences since we sailed from europe on the illfated arrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we never return to civilization as now seems only too likely this will at least prove a brief record of the events which led up to our final fate whatever it may be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as you know we were supposed to have set out upon a scientific expedition to the congo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> papa was presumed to entertain some wondrous theory of an unthinkably ancient civilization the remains of which lay buried somewhere in the congo valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after we were well under sail the truth came out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems that an old bookworm who has a book and curio shop in baltimore discovered between the leaves of a very old spanish manuscript a letter written in detailing the adventures of a crew of mutineers of a spanish galleon bound from spain to south america with a vast treasure of doubloons and pieces of eight i suppose for they certainly sound weird and piraty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the writer had been one of the crew and the letter was to his son who was at the very time the letter was written master of a spanish merchantman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many years had elapsed since the events the letter narrated had transpired and the old man had become a respected citizen of an obscure spanish town but the love of gold was still so strong upon him that he risked all to acquaint his son with the means of attaining fabulous wealth for them both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the writer told how when but a week out from spain the crew had mutinied and murdered every officer and man who opposed them but they defeated their own ends by this very act for there was none left competent to navigate a ship at sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were blown hither and thither for two months until sick and dying of scurvy starvation and thirst they had been wrecked on a small islet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the galleon was washed high upon the beach where she went to pieces but not before the survivors who numbered but ten souls had rescued one of the great chests of treasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this they buried well up on the island and for three years they lived there in constant hope of being rescued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one by one they sickened and died until only one man was left the writer of the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men had built a boat from the wreckage of the galleon but having no idea where the island was located they had not dared to put to sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when all were dead except himself however the awful loneliness so weighed upon the mind of the sole survivor that he could endure it no longer and choosing to risk death upon the open sea rather than madness on the lonely isle he set sail in his little boat after nearly a year of solitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately he sailed due north and within a week was in the track of the spanish merchantmen plying between the west indies and spain and was picked up by one of these vessels homeward bound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the story he told was merely one of shipwreck in which all but a few had perished the balance except himself dying after they reached the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not mention the mutiny or the chest of buried treasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the master of the merchantman assured him that from the position at which they had picked him up and the prevailing winds for the past week he could have been on no other island than one of the cape verde group which lie off the west coast of africa in about x or x north latitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his letter described the island minutely as well as the location of the treasure and was accompanied by the crudest funniest little old map you ever saw with trees and rocks all marked by scrawly xs to show the exact spot where the treasure had been buried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when papa explained the real nature of the expedition my heart sank for i know so well how visionary and impractical the poor dear has always been that i feared that he had again been duped especially when he told me he had paid a thousand dollars for the letter and map <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to add to my distress i learned that he had borrowed ten thousand dollars more from robert canler and had given his notes for the amount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> canler had asked for no security and you know dearie what that will mean for me if papa cannot meet them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how i detest that man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all tried to look on the bright side of things but mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> claytonhe joined us in london just for the adventureboth felt as skeptical as i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well to make a long story short we found the island and the treasurea great ironbound oak chest wrapped in many layers of oiled sailcloth and as strong and firm as when it had been buried nearly two hundred years ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was simply filled with gold coin and was so heavy that four men bent underneath its weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the horrid thing seems to bring nothing but murder and misfortune to those who have anything to do with it for three days after we sailed from the cape verde islands our own crew mutinied and killed every one of their officers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh it was the most terrifying experience one could imaginei cannot even write of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were going to kill us too but one of them the leader named king would not let them and so they sailed south along the coast to a lonely spot where they found a good harbor and here they landed and have left us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sailed away with the treasure today but mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clayton says they will meet with a fate similar to the mutineers of the ancient galleon because king the only man aboard who knew aught of navigation was murdered on the beach by one of the men the day we landed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you could know mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clayton he is the dearest fellow imaginable and unless i am mistaken he has fallen very much in love with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is the only son of lord greystoke and some day will inherit the title and estates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in addition he is wealthy in his own right but the fact that he is going to be an english lord makes me very sadyou know what my sentiments have always been relative to american girls who married titled foreigners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh if he were only a plain american gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it isnt his fault poor fellow and in everything except birth he would do credit to my country and that is the greatest compliment i know how to pay any man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have had the most weird experiences since we were landed here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander lost in the jungle and chased by a real lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clayton lost and attacked twice by wild beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> esmeralda and i cornered in an old cabin by a perfectly awful maneating lioness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh it was simply terrifical as esmeralda would say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the strangest part of it all is the wonderful creature who rescued us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not seen him but mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander have and they say that he is a perfectly godlike white man tanned to a dusky brown with the strength of a wild elephant the agility of a monkey and the bravery of a lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he speaks no english and vanishes as quickly and as mysteriously after he has performed some valorous deed as though he were a disembodied spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we have another weird neighbor who printed a beautiful sign in english and tacked it on the door of his cabin which we have preempted warning us to destroy none of his belongings and signing himself tarzan of the apes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have never seen him though we think he is about for one of the sailors who was going to shoot mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clayton in the back received a spear in his shoulder from some unseen hand in the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sailors left us but a meager supply of food so as we have only a single revolver with but three cartridges left in it we do not know how we can procure meat though mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander says that we can exist indefinitely on the wild fruit and nuts which abound in the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very tired now so i shall go to my funny bed of grasses which mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clayton gathered for me but will add to this from day to day as things happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan sat in a brown study for a long time after he finished reading the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was filled with so many new and wonderful things that his brain was in a whirl as he attempted to digest them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they did not know that he was tarzan of the apes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his tree he had constructed a rude shelter of leaves and boughs beneath which protected from the rain he had placed the few treasures brought from the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought that would be sufficient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later he would return the letter to the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the matter of food thought tarzan they had no need to worryhe would provide and he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning jane found her missing letter in the exact spot from which it had disappeared two nights before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was mystified but when she saw the printed words beneath her signature she felt a cold clammy chill run up her spine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she showed the letter or rather the last sheet with the signature to clayton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to think she said that uncanny thing was probably watching me all the time that i was writingoo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it makes me shudder just to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he must be friendly reassured clayton for he has returned your letter nor did he offer to harm you and unless i am mistaken he left a very substantial memento of his friendship outside the cabin door last night for i just found the carcass of a wild boar there as i came out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from then on scarcely a day passed that did not bring its offering of game or other food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes it was a young deer again a quantity of strange cooked foodcassava cakes pilfered from the village of mbongaor a boar or leopard and once a lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan derived the greatest pleasure of his life in hunting meat for these strangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him that no pleasure on earth could compare with laboring for the welfare and protection of the beautiful white girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some day he would venture into the camp in daylight and talk with these people through the medium of the little bugs which were familiar to them and to tarzan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he found it difficult to overcome the timidity of the wild thing of the forest and so day followed day without seeing a fulfillment of his good intentions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the party in the camp emboldened by familiarity wandered farther and yet farther into the jungle in search of nuts and fruit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarcely a day passed that did not find professor porter straying in his preoccupied indifference toward the jaws of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander never what one might call robust was worn to the shadow of a shadow through the ceaseless worry and mental distraction resultant from his herculean efforts to safeguard the professor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan had finally determined to visit the camp by daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clayton had wandered to the point at the harbors mouth to look for passing vessels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he kept a great mass of wood high piled ready to be ignited as a signal should a steamer or a sail top the far horizon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor porter was wandering along the beach south of the camp with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander at his elbow urging him to turn his steps back before the two became again the sport of some savage beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others gone jane and esmeralda had wandered into the jungle to gather fruit and in their search were led farther and farther from the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarzan waited in silence before the door of the little house until they should return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his thoughts were of the beautiful white girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were always of her now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered if she would fear him and the thought all but caused him to relinquish his plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was rapidly becoming impatient for her return that he might feast his eyes upon her and be near her perhaps touch her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the apeman knew no god but he was as near to worshipping his divinity as mortal man ever comes to worship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he waited he passed the time printing a message to her whether he intended giving it to her he himself could not have told but he took infinite pleasure in seeing his thoughts expressed in printin which he was not so uncivilized after i am tarzan of the apes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we live here together always in my house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will bring you the best of fruits the tenderest deer the finest meats that roam the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am the greatest of the jungle fighters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am the mightiest of the jungle fighters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are jane porter i saw it in your letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you see this you will know that it is for you and that tarzan of the apes loves you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he stood straight as a young indian by the door waiting after he had finished the message there came to his keen ears a familiar sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the passing of a great ape through the lower branches of the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an instant he listened intently and then from the jungle came the agonized scream of a woman and tarzan of the apes dropping his first love letter upon the ground shot like a panther into the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clayton also heard the scream and professor porter and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander and in a few minutes they came panting to the cabin calling out to each other a volley of excited questions as they approached <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a glance within confirmed their worst fears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane and esmeralda were not there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly clayton followed by the two old men plunged into the jungle calling the girls name aloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for half an hour they stumbled on until clayton by merest chance came upon the prostrate form of esmeralda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped beside her feeling for her pulse and then listening for her heartbeats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gods sake where is miss porter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw the jungle about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time professor porter and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god could not have been so cruel as to take my little girl away from me now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must arouse esmeralda first replied clayton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she can tell us what has happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried again shaking the black woman roughly by the shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o gaberelle i want to die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the poor woman but with eyes fast closed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me die dear lord dont let me see that awful face again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lord isnt here its mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> esmeralda did as she was bade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried esmeralda sitting up with wonderful celerity for one of her bulk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must have took her away and the negress commenced to sob and wail her lamentations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great big giant all covered with hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander and the three men scarcely breathed as he voiced the horrible thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it was the devil but i guess it must have been one of them gorilephants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh my poor baby my poor little honey and again esmeralda broke into uncontrollable sobbing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clayton immediately began to look about for tracks but he could find nothing save a confusion of trampled grasses in the close vicinity and his woodcraft was too meager for the translation of what he did see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the balance of the day they sought through the jungle but as night drew on they were forced to give up in despair and hopelessness for they did not even know in what direction the thing had borne jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was long after dark ere they reached the cabin and a sad and griefstricken party it was that sat silently within the little structure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor porter finally broke the silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tones were no longer those of the erudite pedant theorizing upon the abstract and the unknowable but those of the man of action determined but tinged also by a note of indescribable hopelessness and grief which wrung an answering pang from claytons heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall lie down now said the old man and try to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early tomorrow as soon as it is light i shall take what food i can carry and continue the search until i have found jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not return without her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his companions did not reply at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then one day cary my pet canary flew out of her cage and peter ruggles caught her and brought her back and i had him up here in my room to thank him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sarah maud is the oldestshe helps do the washing and peter is the next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and which is the pretty little redhaired girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was born in peoria thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and is the next boy oshkosh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no laughed carol the others are susan and clement and eily and cornelius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how did you ever learn all their names <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i have what i call a windowschool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is too cold now but in warm weather i am wheeled out on my little balcony and the ruggleses climb up and walk along our garden fence and sit down on the roof of our carriagehouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that brings them quite near and i read to them and tell them stories on thanksgiving day they came up for a few minutes it was quite warm at eleven oclock and we told each other what we had to be thankful for but they gave such queer answers that papa had to run away for fear of laughing and i couldnt understand them very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> susan was thankful for trunks of all things in the world cornelius for horse cars kitty for pork steak while clem who is very quiet brightened up when i came to him and said he was thankful for his lame puppy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might teach some of us a lesson mightnt it little girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now im going to give this whole christmas to the ruggleses and uncle jack i earned part of the money myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you see it could not be my own own christmas if papa gave me all the money and i thought to really keep christs birthday i ought to do something of my very own and so i talked with mama <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course she thought of something lovely she always does mamas head is just brimming over with lovely thoughts and all i have to do is ask and out pops the very one i want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this thought was to let her write down just as i told her a description of how a little girl lived in her own room three years and what she did to amuse herself and we sent it to a magazine and got twentyfive dollars for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well well cried uncle jack my little girl a real author <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what are you going to do with this wonderful own money of yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall give the nine ruggleses a grand christmas dinner here in this very roomthat will be papas contribution and afterwards a beautiful christmas tree fairly blooming with presentsthat will be my part for i have another way of adding to my twentyfive dollars so that i can buy everything i like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like it very much if you would sit at the head of the table uncle jack for nobody could ever be frightened of you you dearest dearest dearest thing that ever was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mama is going to help us but papa and the boys are going to eat together down stairs for fear of making the little ruggleses shy and after weve had a merry time with the tree we can open my window and all listen together to the music at the evening churchservice if it comes before the children go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have written a letter to the organist and asked him if i might have the two songs i like best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you see if it is all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wilkie i am the little sick girl who lives next door to the church and as i seldom go out the music on practice days and sundays is one of my greatest pleasures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to know if you can let the boys sing carol brothers carol on christmas night and if the one who sings my ain countree so beautifully may please sing that too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think it is the loveliest song in the world but it always makes me cry doesnt it you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it isnt too much trouble i hope they can sing them both quite early as after ten oclock i may be asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a signal for all the boys even bert to run for though school was out they still did not want to be caught at a fight by one of the teachers or mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow you knocked him down bert said charley mason as he ran on with bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not i slipped said danny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can fight him and i will too some day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not afraid of you answered bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow did not appear to have seen the fight that amounted to so little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter ix whether danny rugg was afraid the principal had seen him trying to force a fight on bert or whether the unexpected fall that came to him caused it no one knew but certainly for the next few days danny let bert alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he passed him he scowled or shook his fist or muttered something about getting even but this was all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it was the thought of what bert had seen fall from dannys pocket that made the bully less anxious to keep up the quarrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate bert was left alone and he was glad of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not afraid but he liked peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the school days went on and the classes settled down to their work for the long winter term <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the thought of the snow and ice that would comparatively soon be with them made the bobbsey twins rejoice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley mason and i are going to make a dandy big bob this year said bert one day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its going to carry ten fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was walking along behind her brother with grace and nellie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure well let you girls ride once in a while said charley as he caught up to his chum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i steered a bob once said grace who was quite athletic for her age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his is a little one alongside the one charley and i are going to make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ours will be hard to steer and its going to have a gong on it to tell folks to get out of the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and wed better start it right away bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doesnt feel so now spoke nan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it feels more like ice cream cones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if youll come with me ill treat you all to some exclaimed nellie parks whose father was quite well off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have some of my birthday money left <end> <end>

<start> <start> she called to the little twins were going to get ice cream cones its so warm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was just wishing for one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so was i added her brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ill ask you to my party next week the little girl went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to have one on my birthday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mamma said i could but she told me not to tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care i wanted nellie to know as shes going to treat us to cones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and its half my party cause my birthdays the same day explained freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you can come to my party at the same time nellie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now lets hurry to the store for its getting warmer all the while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ice cream in the funny little cones was much enjoyed by all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert and charley walked on together eating and talking of the bob sled they were going to make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they passed danny rugg who looked rather enviously at them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hey charley called danny come here i want to speak to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert and i have something to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill see you later spoke charley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had once been quite friendly with danny but he grew not to like his ways and so became more chummy with bert who was very glad for he liked charley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two boys went on to berts barn where they were going to build the bob sled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls with flossie and freddie went on the bobbsey lawn where there were some easy chairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sat in the shade of the trees and freddie had snap do some of his tricks for the visitors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can he jump through a hoop covered with paper as they do in the circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh we never thought to try that said freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to make one and filled with this new idea he hurried into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dinah he said i want some paper and paste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> make a kite an take snoop up in de air laik yo brother bert done once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no were not going to do that answered the little boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to cover a hoop with paper and make snap jump through it like in a circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what will yo all be up to next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but will you make me some paste dinah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you know we havent got snoop anyhow so we couldnt send him up on a kite tail added freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yo chilluns done make me do de mostest wuk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> complained dinah but she laughed which showed that she did not really mean it and set at mixing some flour and water for the paste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie insisted on making the paper covered hoop themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they started but they got so much of the sticky stuff on their hands and faces that nan feared they would soil their clothes so she insisted on being allowed to do the pasting for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we can help cant we <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even for nan covering a hoop with paper was not as easy as she thought it would be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grace and nellie helped but sometimes the wind would blow the paper away just as they were ready to fold it around the rim of the hoop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the paste would get on the girls hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked bert as he and charley came from the barn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had to stop work on their job as they could not find a long enough plank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sic decided to get one from mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to have snap do the circus trick of jumping through a paper hoop explained nan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only we cant seem to get the hoop made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill do it offered bert and as he and charley had often pasted paper on their kite frames they had better luck and soon the hoop was ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called freddie it having been settled that he and flossie were to hold the hoop for the dog to leap through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap always ready for fun jumped up from the grass where he had been sleeping and frisked about barking loudly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you hold him there charley directed bert pointing to a spot back of where freddie and flossie stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then ill go over here and call him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell come running and when he gets near enough freddie you and flossie hold up the paper hoop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it worked out just as the children had planned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap raced away from charley when he heard bert calling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ran right between flossie and freddie who raised the hoop just in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burst the paper and snap sailed through the hoop just as he probably had often done in the circus perhaps from the back of a horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets make a lot of em and have a circus with snap and charge money to see him and then we can buy a lot of ice cream for our party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well they did make more hoops and snap seemed to enjoy jumping through them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey heard about the circus plans she decided it would make too much confusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides you have to help me get ready for your party she said to the two little twins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this took their mind off the proposed circus but for several days after that they had much fun making hoops for snap to jump through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert and charley got a long plank from the lumber yard and spent much time after school in the bobbsey barn working over their bob sled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was harder than they had thought it would be and they had to call in some other boys to help them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey too gave his son some advice about how to build it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie liked it very much in school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kindergarten teacher was very kind and took an interest in all her pupils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried flossie coming in one day from school ive learned how to make a house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i can make a lantern and a chain to hang it on and i can put it in front of flossies house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and please mother may i have some bread and jam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes dear go ask dinah said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then you may show me how you make houses and lanterns and a chain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said flossie theyre only paper but they look nice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure they must said their mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after each of the twins had been given a large slice of bread and butter and jam they showed the latest thing they had learned at school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie did manage to cut out a house that had a chimney on it and a door besides two windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freddie took several little narrow strips of paper and pasting the ends together made a lot of rings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each ring before being pasted was slipped into another and soon he had a paper chain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make the lantern he used a piece of paper made into a roll with slits all around the middle of it where the light would have come out had there been a candle in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the handle was a narrow slip of paper pasted over the top of the lantern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very fine indeed said mamma bobbsey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you stay in the house too much you will soon lose all the lovely tan you got in the country and at the seashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> children said the principal to the bobbseys and all the others in school the next day i have a little treat for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow will be a holiday and as the weather is very warm we will close the school at noon and go off in the woods for a little picnic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried a number of the boys and girls and though it was against the rules to speak aloud during the school hours none of the teachers objected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i expect you all to have perfect marks from now until friday mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may bring your lunches to school with you friday morning if your parents will let you and we will leave here at noon and go to wards woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was rather hard work to study after such good news but somehow the pupils managed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally friday came and nearly every boy and girl came to school with a basket or bundle holding his or her lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey put up two baskets for her children nan taking one and bert the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well have a lovely time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried freddie dancing about on his little fat legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twelve oclock came and with each teacher at the head of her class and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow marching in front of all the whole school started off for the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter x the way to the woods where the little school outing was to be held ran close to the road on which the bobbsey house stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as freddie and flossie with nan and bert marched along with the others freddie cried h i hope we see mamma and then we can wave to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes and maybe shell come with us suggested flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mammas too busy to come to a picnic today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes added nan the minister and his wife are coming and mammas cooking a lot of things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why does a minister eat more than other folks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they does im going to be a minister when i grow up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you were going to be a fireman said bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i can be a fireman week days and a minister on sundays said the little fellow thus solving the problem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but do they eat so much nan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no of course not only mamma wants to be polite to them so she has a lot of things cooked up so that if they dont like one thing they can have another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> folks always give their best to the minister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then im surely going to be one too declared flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like good things to eat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope our minister isnt very hungry cause then therell be some left for us when we come home from this picnic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have a lovely lunch with us plenty im sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well im awful hungry nan said the little girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides sammie jones and his sister julia havent any lunch at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw them and they looked terrible hungry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> couldnt we give them some of ours if we have so much at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course we could and it is very kind of you to think of them said nan as she patted her little sister on her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill look after sammie and julia when we get to the grove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of what nan and bert had said about mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey being very busy flossie and freddie looked anxiously in the direction of their house as they walked along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no sight of their mother greeted them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did see a friend however and this was none other than snap their new dog who with many barks and wags of his fluffy tail ran out to meet his little masters and mistresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the dog leaped all about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets take him to the picnic with us suggested flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can have lots of fun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he can eat the scraps said nan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ask him bert pleaded flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert goodnaturedly started ahead to speak to the principal who was talking with some of the teachers planning games for the little folk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie were patting their pet when danny rugg and one of his friends came along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that dog cant come to our picnic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might bite some of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he cant come to this picnic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried sharply stooping to pick up a stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap growled and showed his teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed nan who had gone up front for a minute to speak to some of the older girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he only growled because you acted mean to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you leave him alone or ill tell mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say no dog can come to our picnic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with raised hand danny approached snap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not used to being treated in this way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look out danny rugg said nan severely or he may jump on you and knock you down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wouldnt bite you though mean as you are unless i told him to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried danny more angry than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill get a stick and then well see what will happen and he looked about for one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pleaded flossie tears coming into her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont said nan looking about anxiously for bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw him coming back and felt better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time danny had found a club and was coming back to where flossie freddie and nan with some of their friends were walking along snap in their midst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill make that dog go home now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not going to get bitten and have hyperfobia or whatever you call it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow if you dont make him go home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed bert stepping out from behind a group of girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow myself that snap is following us and he said to let him come along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you neednt take the trouble danny rugg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you try to hit our dog ill have something more to say and bert stepped boldly forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not afraid of you sneered danny but he let the club drop and walked off with his own particular chums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said hed be good to drive away the cows if they bothered us answered bert with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after this little trouble the bobbseys and their friends went on toward the grove in the woods where the picnic was to be held <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was laughing and shouting and much fun on the way in which snap shared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boys and girls would run to one side or the other of the path to gather late flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some would pick up odd stones or pine cones and others would find curious little creeping or crawling things which they called their friends to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each teacher had charge of her special class but she did not look too closely after them for it was a day to be happy and free from care with no thought of school or lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well make snap do some tricks when we get to the grove said flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes well have a little circus added her brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can he stand on his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he can turn a somersault and hes on his head for a second while hes doing that explained freddie proudly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can he roll over and over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had a dog once that could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ordered and the dog with a bark did so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children laughed and some clapped their hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they thought snap was about the best dog they had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no accidents happened on the way to the grove except that one little boy tried to cross a brook on some stones instead of the plank which the others used <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slipped in and got his feet wet but as the day was warm no one worried much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in a wooded valley with hills on either side and a cold clear spring of water at one end where everyone could get a drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that always seems to be what is most wanted at a picnic a drink of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow called all the children together before letting them go off to play and told them at what time the start for home would be made so that they would not be late in coming back to the meeting place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he said have the best fun you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> play anything you wish school games if you like but dont get too warm or excited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dont go too far away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may eat your luncheon when you like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then lets eat ours now suggested flosssie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so nan and bert decided that the little ones might at least have a sandwich and a piece of cake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor did they forget the two little jones children who had no lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bobbseys were well provided and soon sammie and julia were smiling and happy as they sat beneath a tree eating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came all sorts of games from tag and jumping rope to blindmans bluff and hideandseek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap was made to do a number of tricks much to the amusement of the teachers and children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> danny rugg and some of the older boys got up a small baseball game and then danny with one or two chums went off in a deeper part of the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert heard one of the boys ask another if he had any matches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what theyre going to do whispered bert to nan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw danny have a pack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan was much shocked but she did not see anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was glad bert did not smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert went off with some boys to see if they could catch any fish in the deeper part of the brook about half a mile from the picnic grove and nan with one or two girls about her own age took a little walk with flossie and freddie to gather some late wild flowers that grew on the side of one of the hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they found a number of the blossoms and were making pretty bouquets of them when freddie who had gone on a little ahead of the rest came running back so fast that he nearly rolled to the bottom of the hill so fat and chubby was he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked nan catching her brother just in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got a book about snakes and hell know what to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fright the children turned freddie looking back at the spot where he thought he had seen the snake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xi nan bobbsey stood for a moment she hardly knew why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps she wanted to see the big snake of which freddie spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it certainly was not because she liked reptiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she thought she saw something long and black wiggling toward her and with a little exclamation of fright she too turned to follow the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as she did so she saw their dog snap come running up the hill barking and wagging his tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to have lost the children for a moment and to be telling them how glad he was that he had found them again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straight up the hill toward where freddie had said the snake was rushed snap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no dont let him he may be bitten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but snap evidently did not want to mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on up the hill he rushed pausing now and then to dig in the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nearer and nearer he came to where the little bobbsey boy had said the snake was hiding in the grass and bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but snap kept on and freddie afraid lest his pet dog be bitten caught up a stone and threw it at the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his aim was pretty good but instead of scaring away the snake or driving back snap the fall of the stone only made snap more eager to see what was there that his friends did not want him to get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a loud bark he rushed on and the children turning to look saw something long and black and seemingly wiggling come toward them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed nellie parks in loud tones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called flossie afraid lest her little brother be bitten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap rushed at the black thing so fiercely that he turned a somersault down the hill and rolled over and over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he did not mind this and in an instant was up again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more he rushed at the black object but the children did not watch to see what happened for they were running away as fast as they could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then freddie anxious as to what would become of snap if he fought a snake looked back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dog had in his mouth the long black thing and was running with it toward the bobbseys and their friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may bite him or us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but even though it was down hill the children could not run as fast as snap and he soon caught up to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> running on a little way ahead he dropped the black thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but instead of wiggling or trying to bite it was i very still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt a snake at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its only an old black root of a tree all twisted up like a snake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking courage the girls went up to look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap stood over it wagging his tail as proudly as though he had captured a real snake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as freddie had said it was only a tree root <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it did look a lot like a snake in the grass said the little fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looked like one even when snap had it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so am i spoke grace and nellie made like remark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap frisked about barking as though to ask praise for what he had done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a good dog observed freddie hearing which the animal almost wagged his tail off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if it had been a real snake hed have gotten it wouldnt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if barks meant anything snap said with all his heart that he certainly would that not even a dozen snakes could frighten a big dog like him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children soon got over the little scare and went back up the hill again to gather more flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap went with them this time running about here and there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there are any real snakes said freddie hell scare them away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i guess there arent any <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope not said nan but she and the others kept a sharp lookout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however there was no further fright for them and soon with their hands filled with blossoms the bobbseys and the others went back to the main party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of the teachers were arranging games with their pupils and nan flossie and freddie joined in having a good time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when it was almost time to start for home mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow blew loudly on a whistle he carried to call in the stragglers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked flossie looking about for her older brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess he hasnt come back from fishing yet said nan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come flossie and freddie i have a little bit of lunch left and you might as well eat it so you wont be hungry on the way home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the littler bobbsey twins were glad enough to do this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they had to have a drink and nan went with them to the spring carrying a glass tumbler she had brought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this isnt like our nice silver cup that the fat lady took in the train said freddie as he passed the glass of water very carefully to flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she said after she had taken her drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder if papa will ever get that back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said the other day remarked nan as she got some water for freddie that he hadnt heard from the circus yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt like snoop our cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont know where he is but were pretty sure the fat lady has the cup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried freddie as he thought of the fine black cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe some of the railroad men have him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they got back to where the teachers and principal were bert and the boys who bad gone fishing had returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had one or two small fish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to have mamma cook them for my supper said bert proudly holding up those he had caught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre too small there wont be anything left of them after theyre cleaned said nan who was quite a little housekeeper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes there will declared her brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going fishing again tomorrow and catch more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow was going about among the teachers asking if all their pupils were on hand ready for the march back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> danny rugg and some of his close friends were missing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ought not to have gone off so far said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow as he blew several times on the whistle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon danny and the other boy were seen coming from a distant part of the grove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the boys harry white looked very pale and not at all well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow and he looked curiously at danny and the others and sniffed the air as though he smelled something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i i guess i ate too many apples said harry in a faint voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found an orchard and i told you not to go into orchards and take fruit said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man said we could remarked danny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you should not have eaten so many said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant see how ripe apples which are the only kind there are this time of year could make you ill unless you ate too many and he looked at danny and harry sharply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the march home was not as joyful as the one to the grove had been for most of the children were tired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they all had had a fine time and there were many requests of the teachers to have another picnic the next week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh we cant have them every week my dears said miss franklin who had charge of flossie freddie and some others in the kindergarten class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides it will soon be too cool to go out in the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a little while we will have ice and snow and thanksgiving and christmas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will be better than picnics said freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to have a new sled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to get a new doll that can walk declared flossie and then she and the others talked about the coming holidays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at school several days in the following week little was talked of except the picnic the snake scare from the old tree root the catching of the fish and the illness of harry white for that boy was quite sick by the time town was reached and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow called a carriage to send him home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i can guess what made him sick too said bert to nan privately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because when i and some of the other fellows were fishing we saw danny and his crowd smoking in the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they offered us some but we wouldnt take any <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry said he was sick then but danny only laughed at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that danny rugg is a bad boy said nan severely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she was soon to see how much meaner danny could be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> workmen had recently finished putting some new water pipes and a place for the children to drink in the school yard and one morning speaking to the whole school mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow made a little speech warning the children not to play with the faucets and spray the water about as some had done in fun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whoever is caught playing with the faucets in the yard after this will be severely punished he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it happened flossie and freddie were not at school that day freddie having a slight sore throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother kept him home and flossie would not go without him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they did not hear the warning and bert and nan did not think to tell the smaller children of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two days later freddie was well enough to go back to class and flossie accompanied him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was at the morning recess when as freddie went to get a drink at one of the new faucets danny saw him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gleam of mischief came into the eyes of the school bully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> want to see the water squirt freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a new kind of faucet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had no idea it was forbidden fun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just put your thumb over the hole and turn the water on directed danny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> danny looked all around thinking he was unobserved as he gave this bad advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally freddie and flossie being so young suspected nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they covered the opening of the faucet with their thumbs and turned on the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it spurted in a fine spray and they laughed in glee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that they wet each other did not matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> danny seeing the success of his trick walked off as he saw mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bobbsey twins were so intent on spurting the water that they did not observe the principal until he was close to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know that it is forbidden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go to my office at once and i will come and see you later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will be punished for this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with tears in their eyes the little twins obeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow a little later entered his office he found flossie and freddie standing by one of the windows looking out on the other children marching to their classrooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had cried a little but had stopped now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very sorry to have to punish you two twins said the principal but i had given strict orders that no one was to play with that water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> danny rugg told us to added freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said it was a new kind of faucet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often before he had heard pupils say that someone else told them to break certain rules <end> <end> 
<start> <start> danny told us to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but didnt you know it was forbidden? <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i spoke of it in all the rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we wasnt here yesterday or the day before said flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will look this up he said and if find he was interrupted by a boy from one of the higher classes coming in with a note from his teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wanted a new box of chalk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you go back george said the principal to the boy as he gave him what the teacher had sent for go to miss hegans class and have her send danny rugg to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie say he told them to spray water with one of the new faucets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard him but i didnt think they would do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if that is the case danny is the one to be punished he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry flossie and freddie that i suspected you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may go back to your class and i will write your teacher a note saying you may go out half an hour ahead of the others to make up for coming to my office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after this no matter whether anyone tells you or not dont spray the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the bobbsey twins now happy again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> danny rugg was punished by being kept in after school for several days and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow sent home a note to his father explaining what a mean trick the bully had played <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i had heard danny telling you that just to get you in trouble said bert when he was told of what had happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh dont get into any more fights begged nan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert did not come to blows with danny over this latest trouble but he did tell the bully very plainly what he thought of him and said if danny ever did a thing like that again that he would not get off so easily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh im not afraid of you sneered danny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lessons and fun made up many school days for the bobbsey twins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as the fall went on lessons grew a little harder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even freddie and flossie young as they were had little tasks to do that kept them busy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they liked their school and the teacher and many were the queer stories they brought home of the happenings in the classroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was now toward the end of october and the weather was getting cooler though during the day it was still very warm at times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the twins as did their friends looked forward to the coming of winter and the christmas holidays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thanksgiving too would be a time of rejoicing and of good things to eat and this occasion was to be made more of than usual this time for some boys and girls the bobbseys had met in the country and at the seashore were to be invited to spend a few days in lakeport <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before this there was another event down on the program <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was to be a party for flossie and freddie the occasion being their joint birthdays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and were going to have candy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried freddie when the arrangements were talked over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ice cream added flossie a whole freezer full arent we mamma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i guess a small freezer full wont be any too much said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i hope none of you eat enough to make yourselves ill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we wont promised freddie and flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were busy times in the home of the twins the next few days for though nan and berts birthdays were not to be observed still they were to have their part in the jolly celebration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> invitations were sent out on little sheets of note paper adorned with flowers and in cute little envelopes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie took them to the postoffice themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the clerk at the stamp window as he saw the children dropping the invitations into the slot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> uncle sam will have to get some extra men to carry that around i guess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to have a party said flossie proudly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then danny rugg came into the postoffice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im coming to it i am and im going to have two plates of ice cream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mamma wouldnt let a boy like you come to our party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> specially not after what you did telling us to play in the water added freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i can insisted danny just to tease the children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment flossie and freddie almost believed him he seemed so much in earnest about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant come you havent any invitation said flossie suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill take one of those you put in the box went on the mean boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and freddie appealed to the mail clerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the man at the stamp window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he does uncle sam will be after him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well im coming to that party all the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> insisted danny with a grin on his freckled face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie were so worried about him that they told their mother but she assured them that danny would not come to spoil their fun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally the afternoon and evening of the party arrived for the little folks were to come just before supper play some games eat and then stay until about nine oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie had been dressed in their prettiest clothes and nan and bert also attired for the affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ice cream had come from the store all packed in ice and salt and dinah had set it out on the back stoop where it would be cooler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dinah was very busy that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hurried about here and there helping mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sam her husband also had plenty to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dinah exclaimed i suah will get thin ef dish yeah keeps up <end> <end>

<start> <start> and something was to happen though not exactly what dinah expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally all was in readiness for the guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the good things to eat were in the kitchen all but the ice cream which as i have said was out on the back porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie had gone to the front door nearly a dozen times to see if any of the guests were in sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap as a special favor had been allowed to stay in the house that afternoon for the twins were going to make him do tricks for their friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came a ring at the door bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me answer too cried freddie and they both hurried through the front hall to greet the first guest at their party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xiii quickly after the first guests had arrived came the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nellie parks grace lavine friends of nan and willie porter and his sister sadie came first and freddie and flossie let them in the porter children being some of their bestliked playmates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the children wore their best clothes and for a time they were a bit stiff and unnatural standing shyly about in corners against the walls or sitting on chairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys seemed to all crowd together in one part of the room and the girls in another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie nan and bert were so busy answering the door that they did not notice this at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but aunt sarah their mothers sister who had come over to help mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey looking in the parlor and library saw what the trouble was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> screamed freddie from the other side of the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and before anyone could stop him he pulled up a whole handful of the little green leaves with the tiny red balls on the roots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shouted dancing around in delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must only pick the ripe ones his father told him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john showed me he declared and the girls said that was really freddies garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ill tell you aunt sarah remarked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will let our little farmers pick their vegetables for dinner and then we will be able to say just how good they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this the girls started in to pick the very biggest heads of lettuce and freddie looked carefully to get the very reddest radishes in his patch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally enough were gathered and down to the kitchen the vegetables were carried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will have to prepare them for the table mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us see girls what a pretty dish you can make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a pleasant task to nan and flossie who both always loved to play at housekeeping and when at last nan brought the dish in to the dinner table everybody said how pretty it looked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed freddie as he saw the pretty bright red buttons peeping out from between the lettuce leaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we can all have some cant we freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont want all my good redishes smothered in that big dish of green stuff he pouted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now nan you can serve your vegetables aunt sarah said and then nan very neatly put a few crisp lettuce leaves on each small plate and at the side she placed a few of freddies radishes with handles on as dinah said meaning the little green stalks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just think weve done it all from the garden to the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan exclaimed justly proud of her success at gardening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i done the radishes put in freddie gulping down a drink of water to wash the bite off his tongue for his radishes were quite hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you have certainly all done very nicely mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that kind of play is like going to school for it teaches you important lessons in nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls declared they were going to keep a garden all summer and so they did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an unusually warn night and so nearly all the doors were left open when the folks went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freddie was so worked up over his success as a gardener he could not go to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he dozed off but presently he awoke with a start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was that yes somebody must surely be playing the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to come in funny runs and curious thumps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called out sharply and his mother came at once to his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard pianoplaying said freddie and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey started for she remembered how flossie had once told her the same thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it wasnt very good playing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey called uncle daniel and the latter lit a lamp and went below into the parlor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody was at the piano or in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive made a careful examination he said on coming back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of the children left a piece of cake on the keys of the piano thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well cake cant play put in freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no you must have been dreaming said his mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come go to sleep and presently freddie dropped off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey was much worried and the next day the older folks talked the matter over but nothing came of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xii tom mason is going to bring his colt out this afternoon said harry to bert and we can all take turns trying him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh is it that pretty little brown horse i saw in the field back of toms home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i would like firstrate to ride him but young horses are awful skittish arent they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes but this one is partly broken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate we wouldnt have far to fall for he is a little fellow said harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the boys went down to toms home at the appointed time and there they met jack hopkins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve made a track around the fields tom told his companions and we will train him to run around the ring for father thinks he may be a race horse some day hes so swift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may go first the boys told him as hes your horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom replied making for the stake where sable the pony was tied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sable marched along quietly enough and made no objections to tom getting on his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no saddle but just the bit in the horses mouth and attached to it a short piece of rein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called tom snapping a small whip at the ponys side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but instead of going forward the little horse tried to sit down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called the boys but tom clung to sables neck and held on in spite of the ponys back being like a toboggan slide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get off there get off there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> urged tom yet the funny little animal only backed down more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> light a match and set it under his nose harry suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way to make a balky horse go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> someone had a match which was lighted and put where sable could sniff the sulphur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yelled the boys all at once for at that instant sable bolted off like a deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called bert which was plain to be seen for tom could neither turn him this way or that but had all he could do to hold on the frightened animals neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he throws him tom will surely be hurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry exclaimed and the boys ran as fast as they could across the field after the runaway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called everybody after the horse but that made not the slightest difference to sable who just went as if the woods were afire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he turned and dashed straight up a big hill and over into a neighbors cornfield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried harry those people are so mean about their garden theyll have tom arrested if theres any corn broken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it was impossible for a runaway horse to go through a field of corn and do no damage and tom realized this too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time the dogs were out barking furiously and altogether there was wild excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at one and of the field there was a high board fence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could only get him there he would have to stop thought tom and suddenly he gave sable a jerk in that direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell throw you against the fence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at that minute the little horse threw himself against the boards in such a way that tom slid off yet held tightly to the reins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as quickly as they could get there the boys came up to help tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said harry there is scarcely any corn broken and we can get away before the trimbles see us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre away back in the fields planting late cabbage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom felt hardly able to walk but he limped along while harry led sable carefully between the cornhills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only a few feet to the edge of the field and then they were all safe on the road again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys asked tom when finally they had a chance to speak about the runaway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel as if i had dropped from a balloon onto a lot of cobblestones tom answered but i guess thats only the shaking up i got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes indeed harry admitted i guess he doesnt like the smell of sulphur matches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucky he was not injured with that fall against the fence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found i had to throw him tom said and i thought the fence was softer than a tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose we ought to make him run until he is played out said bert thats the way to cure a horse of running away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but none of the boys felt like risking their bones even to cure sable so the panting animal was led to the stable and for the rest of the day allowed to think over his bad conduct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that was not the last of the runaway for in the evening just after supper old mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trimble paid a visit to toms father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came over to tell you what a scallywag of a boy youve got began the cross old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and a lot of young loafers took a horse and drove him all through my cornfield today and now youve got to pay the damages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my son is not a scallywag mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mason declared and if you call him names like loafer and scallywag ill make you pay damages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think im afraid of an old constable up here do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mason said be reasonable and do not quarrel over an accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any corn is knocked down ill get tom to fix it up if its broken down we will see what it would cost to replace it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the boys did not do it purposely and it was worse for tom than anyone else for hes all black and blue from the hard knocks he got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this the cross man quieted down and said well he would see about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trimble was one of those queer people who believe all a boy is good for is doing mischief and all a boy deserves is scolding or beating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps this was because he had no sons of his own and therefore had no regard for the sons of other people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mason went directly to the cornfield with his neighbor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked carefully over every hill and with a spade and hoe he was able to put back into place the few stalks that had been knocked down in sables flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mason i guess that corn is as good as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it wants any more hoeing tom will come around in the morning and do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is too stiff to move tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that ended the runaway except for a very lame boy tom mason who had to limp around for a day or two from stiffness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how would you like to be a jockey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you held on like a champion but you were not in training for the banging you got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i guess sable will make a fine racehorse said tom when hes broken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it will take someone stronger than i am to break him in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next afternoon all the boys went fishing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had been out quite late the night before to find the night walkers for bait as those little worms only come out of the ground after dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert had a new line his father brought from lakeport and the others boys had nets and hooks as most country boys who live near streams are always fond of fishing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets go over to the cove harry said when they all started off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres lots of good fish in that dark corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the cove was chosen as a good spot to fish from and soon the bobbsey boys and their friends were iying around the edge of the deep clear stream waiting for a bite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert was the first to jerk his line and he brought it up with such force that the chubfish on his hook slapped harry right in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called harry trying to dodge the flapping fish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a good one but i dont care about having him kiss me that way again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the boys laughed at bert who was a green fisherman they said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fish was really a very nice plump chub and weighed more than a pound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he floundered around in the basket and flapped his tail wildly trying to get away from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got one called tom next at the same moment pulling his line and bringing up a pretty little sunfish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now sunnies are not considered good eating so toms catch did not come up to berts but it was put in the basket just the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going out on the springboard august stout announced stepping cautiously out on the board from which good swimmers dived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know you cant swim august said harry and if you get a catch and jerk it youll tumble in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be all right august answered lying down flat on the narrow springboard and dropping his line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time all the boys lay watching for a bite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one spoke for sometimes they say fish are very sensitive to sound and go in another direction if they hear a voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a beautiful july day and perhaps the boys were a little lazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate they all became so quiet the little woodpeckers on the trees went on with their work pecking at the tree bark as if no human being was in sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly there was a big splash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yelled all the boys at once for indeed angust was gone from the springboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next minute the boy in the water came to the top and threw up his arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no one was near enough to reach it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were coming and one boy after the other dropped in the water now having thrown off their heavy clothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> screamed bert in terror for no movement on the waters surface showed them where august was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried tom mason who was quite a distance out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no need to urge the boys to hasten for all realized the danger their companion was in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont pull down august went on tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> try to help yourself or youll pull me under <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry had around his neck a strong piece of rope he picked up as he made a dive into the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take hold of this he called to august and we can all pull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the rope was put in augusts hand the other boys all took hold and soon towed the unfortunate boy in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes very weak said harry when they pulled august up on the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess he has swallowed a lot of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we better roll him on the grass and work his arms up and down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> august was indeed very weak and had had a narrow escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some time his companions worked over him before he opened his eyes and spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he murmured at last im so sick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess you are august said tom but youll be all right soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they lifted him carefully under a shady tree and removed his wet clothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill run over to smiths and get him something to wear home said harry who hurried across lots and presently returned with an old suit of clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> august was able to dress himself now and as soon as he felt strong enough the boys helped him home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can have my fish august said bert nobly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> august did not want to accept the boys offers at first but at last they prevailed upon him to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i fell asleep said he referring to the accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> added harry for we only woke up when we heard the splash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems the number of accidents country boys have only make them truer friends for all the things that happened in meadow brook made each boy think more of his companions both in being grateful for the help given and being glad no dear friends life was lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xiii mother said harry using that loved name to show that what he was about to say was something important peter burns is sick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has not been able to work since the cannon exploded and gave him the shock and all his peas are spoiling because theres no one to pick them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns hired some boys yesterday but they broke down so many vines she had to stop them and mother would you mind if bert and i picked some today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why my dear replied aunt sarah it would be very nice of you to help peter he has always been a kind neighbor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think it would do you any harm to pick peas on a cool day like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert can ask his mother and if she is satisfied you can put on your play overalls and go right along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both boys were given the desired permission and when tom and jack heard where the bobbseys were going they said at once they would go along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you sure your mother wont mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns asked the boys knowing harrys folks did not need the money paid to pick the peas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course im very glad to have you if your mothers are satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon each boy had a big basket under his arm and was off for the beautiful field of soft green peas that stretched along the pond bank at the side of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now peas are quite an expensive vegetable when they come in first and farmers who have big fields of them depend upon the return from the crop as an important part of the summers income <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the peas must be picked just as soon as they are ripe or else they will spoil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was why harry got his friends to turn in to help poor peter burns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill go down this row and you take that suggested bert to harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we can talk to each other without hollering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all right harry replied snapping the peas off the vines and dropping them into his basket like a real farmer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets have a race called tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see who gets his basket full first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no skipping for big ones put in jack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have to pick every ripe one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys all started in at the top of the hill each working two rows at a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were so interested in the race that scarcely a word was spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the peas were plentiful and ripe too so that the baskets were filling up quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns herself was picking in fact she had been in the field since the very first peep of dawn and she would be sure to stay out until the darkness would drive her in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are fine pickers she told the boys seeing how quickly they worked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pay ten cents a basket you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess we can earn a dollar a day at this rate laughed tom whose basket was almost full <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im done called jack from his row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no youre not said harry you have to cover the rim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed jack who had just slipped between the rows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and sure enough the big basket had been upset in jacks fall and most of the peas were scattered on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called tom picking his basket up in his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill be last i guess laughed tom trying hard to pick up the scattered peas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called harry and now all the boys carried their baskets to the big bag at the end of the field and dumped them in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wont take long to fill the bag said harry and it will be so good for peter to have them ready for tomorrow is market day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the boys worked on right along until lunch time each having picked four big baskets full <end> <end> 
<start> <start> august stout came along and helped some too but he could not stay long as he had to cut some clothes poles for his mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns looking at the three full bags the boys had picked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i cant pay until peter comes from market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we just did it for fun answered harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed you must have forty cents apiece ten cents a basket she insisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see what a good load you have picked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns mother wouldnt like us to take the money harry declared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are glad to have helped you and it was only fun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns was so grateful she had to wipe her eyes with her gingham apron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well she said finally there are some people in this world who talk about charity but a good boy is a gift from heaven and she said this just like a prayer of blessing on the boys who had helped her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crop would have been spoiled tomorrow remarked tom as he and his companions started up the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im awfully glad you thought of helping her harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed all that day everything went right for the boys they did not have even a single mishap in their games or wanderings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it was because they felt so happy over having done a good turn for a poor neighbor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say fellows tom said later while they sat on the pond bank trying to see something interesting in the cool clear water what do you say if we make up a circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fine the others answered but what will be the show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> animals of course continued tom weve got plenty around here havent we <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this the boys all laughed at tom remembering the runaway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i could be a cowboy and ride him just the same spoke up tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rode him around the track yesterday and he went all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was only scared with that sulphur match when he ran away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a circus would be fine bert put in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could have frisky as the sacred calf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and snoopy as the wild cat said harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and two trained goats august added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a real human bear teddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a cage of pigeons went on harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets get them all in training said tom jumping up suddenly anxious to begin the sport <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can each train our own animals and then we can bring them together in a wellorganized circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about next week harry thought and this was decided upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the interval the boys were so busy training that they had little time for other sports but the girls found outdoor life quite as interesting as their brothers did and now made many discoveries in and about the pretty woodlands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh we saw the prettiest little rabbits today nan told her mother after a trip in the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie were sitting on an old stump when two rabbits ran right across the road in front of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freddie ran after them as far as he could go in the brushwood but of course no one can go as fast as a rabbit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the squirrels flossie told them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think the squirrels are the prettiest things that live in the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have tails just like mammas feather boa and they walk sitting up so cute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i think the rabbits are the nicest lisped freddie cause they are bunnies and bunnies bring easter eggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we have made the loveliest fern garden up back of the swing said flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got a whole basket of ferns in the woods and transplanted them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the center we have some lovely jackin thepulpits nan added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some are light green striped and the largest are purple with gold stripes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jacks stand up straight just like real live boys preaching in a pulpit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think mamma asked flossie that daisies and violets make a lovely garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a round place in the middle of our wild flower bed just full of light blue violets and white daisies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all flowers are beautiful their mamma told them but i do think with flossie that daisies and violets are very sweet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mamma we got a big piece of the loveliest green moss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is just like real velvet said flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found a place all covered with it down by the pond under the dark cedar trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan said it wouldnt grow in our garden but i brought some home to try <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put it in a cool dark place and im going to put lots of water on it every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moss must be very cool and damp to grow mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember how disappointed i used to be when i was a little girl and tried to make it grow around my geraniums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would always dry up and turn brown in a few days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh called freddie from his garden under the cherry tree come quick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan and flossie hurried to where their little brother had dug a hole in the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while flossie ran to tell bert nan watched the tiny mice so that they would not get away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a nest of field mice harry told them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well put them in a cage and have them in our circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theyre my mice cried freddie and i wont let anybody have them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were only going to help you take care of them in a little box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh theres the mother catch her harry called bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother mouse was not so easy to catch however and the boys had quite a chase after her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last she ran into a tin box the boys had sunk in the ground when playing golf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here harry caught the frightened little creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got a queer kind of a trap harry said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can put them in this until we build a larger one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can make one out of a box with a wire door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mice were the smallest cutest things not larger than freddies thumb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hardly looked like mice at all but like some queer little bugs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were put in the cage trap mother and all and then bert got them a bit of cheese from the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you go bringing dem mice in de house to eat all our cake and pie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you just better drown dem in de brook before dey bring a whole lot more mices around here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well keep them away from the house bert told dinah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to have a circus you know and these will be our trained mice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freddie of course was delighted with the little things and wanted to dig for more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we might catch butterflies and have them under a big glass on the table with all the small animals that would be good harry agreed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could catch some big brown ones and some little fancy ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then after dark we could get some big moths down by the postoffice electric light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls too went catching butterflies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan was able to secure four or five yellow ones in the flower garden near the porch and flossie got two of the small brown variety in the nasturtium bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry and bert searched in the close syringa bushes where the nests are usually found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called freddie coming up with a great green butterfly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it really was very large and had such beautiful wings it might easily be mistaken for some strange bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will try to keep them alive said harry and perhaps we can get mas big glass globe to put them in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has one she used to put wax flowers under <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed bert couldnt we have an aquarium with snakes and turtles and toads in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve got a big glass tank i used to have gold fish in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well get the other fellows to help catch some snakes fish and turtles and toads and and anything else that will stand water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then what a time they had hunting for reptiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed each boy had a different variety on his premises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> august stout brought three turtles and jack hopkins caught two snakes under a big stone in his back yard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom mason supplied four lovely gold fish while ned prentice brought three bright green frogs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can catch hoptoads declared freddie and sure enough the little fellow brought two big ones and a baby toad in his hat down to the boys who had their collection in a glass tank in the barn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant put the snakes in with the others or theyll eat them up said jack <end> <end>

<start> <start> will we charge admission to the show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure five cents each said tom and give the money to the freshair camp over on the mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was considered a good plan and now it was only a few days more until wednesday the day of the circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xiv news of the circus had spread from one end of meadow brook to the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every boy and girl in the place expected to get in to see the sights and even some grown folks had made up their minds from what they heard there would be something interesting for them to see and so they decided to go too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey aunt sarah dinah and martha had bought tickets for reserved seats these cost ten cents each <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then mildred manners was going to bring her mother and her big sister and mabel herold expected to have her mother with her also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey was coming up from lakeport purposely to see the circus and uncle daniel had helped the boys put up the seats and fix things generally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a big tent had been borrowed from the herolds they were only out at meadow brook for the summer and this tent was erected in the open field between the bobbsey and the mason farms alongside the track where tom had tried sable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tent had large flaps that opened up the entire front so that all the exhibits could be shown nicely to the people on the seats out side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the seats were made of boards set on most anything that would hold them with a few garden benches for reserved seats at the front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything was ready and the circus day came at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucky it isnt raining the boys declared as they rushed around putting the final touches to everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> august stout was appointed to collect the tickets and ned prentice was to show the people to their seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lots of children came early to get good seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roy mason sat right in the front row alongside of freddie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nettie prentice was on the very first bench back of the reserved seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the herolds came next and had aunt sarahs front garden bench the red one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred manners folks paid ten cents each too and they had the big green bench from the side porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burns a front seat harry whispered to ned as the busy farmers wife actually stopped her work to see what all the excitement was about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey and all and dinah wore her best black bonnet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie asked just trembling with excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw harry and bert go in the tent some time ago whispered nan and see they are loosing the tent flap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a shout of applause when harry appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he actually wore a swallowtail coat and had on a choker a very high collar and a bright green tie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore long trousers too and looked so queer even aunt sarah had to laugh when she saw him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed all the children when they looked inside the tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then bert stepped up on the soap box in the middle of the ring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ladies and gentlemen he began making a profound bow ladies and gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert had to wait until they got through laughing at his funny costume which in a few moments bert went on again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our first number is frisky the sacred calf of india <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed imitating that queervoiced man called a barker and used at circuses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> went berts whip and out from a side place back of a big screen came jack hopkins dressed like a real clown leading our old friend frisky the runaway calf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the calf had over him a plush portiere that reached clear down to the ground and over each ear was tied a longhandled feather duster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such laughing and clapping as greeted this first number <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frisky just turned around square in front and looked the people straight in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobbsey die laughing as flossie said and uncle daniel too was hilarious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sacred calf is too sacred to smile laughed uncle daniel while dinah and martha just roared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children didnt think they ought to laugh out loud and spoil the show even freddie raised his finger to dinah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly the clown jumped on the calfs back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to stand on his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he turned a somersault on to the sawdust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody clapped hard now and the children began to shout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but bert snapped his whip and the clown went down on his hands and knees to apologize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course clowns are not supposed to speak so jack did everything by pantomime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next he came around and kissed frisky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this made everybody roar again and no matter what the clown did it certainly looked very funny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally bert snapped his whip three times and the clown jumped on friskys back over the plush curtain and all and rode off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i really never enjoyed a big circus more than this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others all said nice things too and then bert announced the next turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ladies and gentlemen he began again our next number will introduce to you the famous wildcats snoop and fluffy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> real wildcats from the jungle and this is the first time they have ever been exhibited in this country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap went the whip and out came harry with our little kitten friends one on each arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he whistled and snoop climbed on his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he whistled again and fluffy climbed on the other shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this brought the house down as uncle daniel said and there was so much noise the kittens looked frightened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next harry stretched out both arms straight and the kittens carefully walked over into his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he cant do real reglar circus tricks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and jest to think how he cut up on de cars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pears like as if he was doin it fer jokes den too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed martha as white as snoop is black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry stooped down and let the kittens jump through his hands which is an old but none the less a very pretty trick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the air of a real master bert snapped his whip and placed on the table a little piece of board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rubbed something on each end it was a bit of dried herring but the people didnt know that then harry put snoop on one end and fluffy on the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called freddie unable to restrain his joy any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sound of freddies voice snoop turned around and the move sent fluffy up the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> came a chorus from the children but before anybody in the circus had time to interfere off went fluffy as hard as she could run over the lots home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next minute snoop was after her and harry stood alone in the ring bowing to the tremendous applause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the laughing had ceased bert made the next announcement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ladies and gentlemen he said we will now introduce our famous menagerie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first we have the singing mice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called freddie but nan insisted on him keeping quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you will hear the mice sing said bert and as he held up the cage of little mice somebody whistled a funny tune back of the scenes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve got real talent here he added for indeed the boys had put together a fine show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you see our aquarium went on bert as harry helped him bring forward here we have a real sea serpent he said pointing to a good fat chub that flopped around in the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let the little ones walk right up and see them bert said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> form in line and pass in this way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only the children went up but grown folks too for they wanted a look into the tank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now here are our alligators and crocodiles announced bert pointing his whip at the turtles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and these are sealions he said pointing out freddies hoptoads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at each announcement everybody laughed but bert went on as seriously as if he were deaf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this separate tank he declared we have our boaconstrictors the largest and fiercest in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the first time one of this specimen has ever been captured alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> note the dangerous stripe on his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was jacks snakes that came in for this description and the girls were quite afraid of them although they were in a glass jar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if this isnt a sureenough circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i often paid a halfdollar when i went to see things no better than these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody thought everything was splendid and the boys were well paid for their efforts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said bert here are our crystal fish from the deep sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will notice how bespangled they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say this comes from the fish eating the diamonds lost in shipwrecks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called someone back of the scenes whose voice sounded like torn masons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> went berts whip and the boys did not interrupt him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last part of our menagerie is the cage of prize butterflies said bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these butterflies are rare and scarce and hard to catch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remarked someone not on the programme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there will be ten minutes intermission the announcer said so all may have time to see everything in the menagerie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that we will give you the best number of the programme our chariot race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh thats going to be tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well jack has our goatwagon said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess therell be a whole lot in the race said freddie and maybe theyll have firemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the intermission august sold a whole big basket of peanuts and the people wanted more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they knew all the money was to go to the freshair camp which was probably the reason they bought so generously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know when i have enjoyed myself so much declared mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no idea boys could be so clever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats because you only have girls laughed mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think we ought to give them a treat for working so hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would be delighted to have them all to dinner she added in her society way for the herolds were quite rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be very nice im sure aunt sarah replied boys always have good appetites after having a lot of fun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this time there was plenty of noise back of the scenes and it was evident something big was being prepared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently bert and harry came out and lowered tile tent flap first making sure all the little sightseers were outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed freddie clapping his fat hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope none of the animals will get loose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ladies and gentlemen called tom mason appearing at the tent if you will just turn round the other way in your seats and face that ring we will give you an exhibition of cowboy life on the plains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xv toms costume was a splendid imitation of a cowboy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore tancolored overalls and a jumper the jumper being slashed up at the sides like an indians coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his head was a very broad sombrero this hat having really come from the plains as it belonged to a western farmer who had lately moved to meadow brook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently tom appeared again this time riding the fiery sable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shouted the boys as tom drove into the ring like a major <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert now stepped into the middle of the ring alongside of some soap boxes that were piled up there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you see ladies and gentlemen began bert laughing a little at the show in broad daylight you see this the soap boxes is a mail coach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our cowboy will rob the mail coach from his horse just as they used to do in the mountains of arizona <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap went the whip and away went sable around the ring at a nice even canter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a few turns around tom urged his horse on a little until he was going on a steady run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every one kept quiet for most of meadow brook people had heard how sable had run away some days before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there ought to be music whispered jack to harry for indeed the circus was so real it only lacked a brass band <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now bert put on top of the soap boxes harrys canvas schoolbag stuffed full of papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the united states mail he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will understand that the coach has stopped for a few minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sable was going along splendidly by this time and everybody said what a pretty little horse he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes goin to steal the mail box now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope sable wont fall or anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> went the whip as the horse ran faster and faster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all of a sudden tom got a good tight hold on the reins then he pulled up alongside of the mail coach leaned over grabbed the mail bag and spurred his horse at full speed around the ring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom waved his hat now and patted sable affectionately as all good riders do when their horses have done well in the ring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men admired the little horse so much they came up and asked the cowboy a lot of questions about him how old he was and who broke him in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this all took their seats again and out trotted two clowns jack and august each riding in a little goat wagon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the goats were decorated with the fourth of july buntings and the wagons had the tailboards out and were tipped up like circus chariots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clowns pulled up in line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called bert with a really big revolver up in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> went the revolver a blank cartridge of course and away started the chariots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack wore a broad green belt and august had yellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now august passed jack just as they crossed the line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the next the wagons kept almost even until just within a few feet of the line then jack crossed first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called bert while all the boys shouted for their favorite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the next three or four turns the riders divided even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally the last round was reached and the boys had tied that is both were even when the round started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this of course made the race very interesting as both had equal chances of winning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill put a dollar on green called mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill put one on orange called uncle daniel for the same charity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the ladies all wanted to bet but bert said it was against the rules to allow betting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will take all the money you want to give us said bert but we cannot allow betting on the races <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called the ringmaster holding his revolver high in the air again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my how those little goats did run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shout after shout greeted the riders as they urged their steeds around the ring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly jacks chariot crossed in front of august <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called bert while jack tried his best to get on his own side again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yelled jack to his horse goat but the little animal was too excited to obey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally fat august stout the funniest clown dashed home first and won the race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shouted the boys long and loud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the money was counted and there was exactly twentythree dollars to be given the poor children in the meadow brook freshair camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to think everybody had such a good time too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freddie and roy were allowed to ride home in the goat wagons and they tried to race along the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a committee of five boys bert harry jack tom and august took the money over to the freshair camp the next day and the managers said it was a very welcome gift for new coats were needed for some sick children that were expected to come out from the city as soon as provision could be made for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody dropped a twodollar bill in the ticket box august told his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there were the other two dollars from the race besides some fiftycent pieces i dont know who gave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course we couldnt make all that just on five and tencent seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i took in two dollars on the peanuts besides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well were all satisfied said harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i guess everybody had a good time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure they did spoke up tom and i hope bert will come out here next year to help us with another big circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre the best fun we ever had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some days every boy and girl in meadow brook talked about the circus which had really been a greater success than even the boys themselves had expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a warm afternoon quite late in july one of those days that make a boy feel lazy and inclined to stretch himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert and harry were down back of the barn sitting on the fresh stack of hay that had just been piled up by john the stableman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry asked bert suddenly as if he had discovered something new and interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither would pa said harry but i suppose every fellow has to try it some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive seen them make cigarettes out of corn silk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose that is not as bad as tobacco replied bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no answered harry theres no harm in corn silk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guess ill try to roll a cigarette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this harry slid down off the hay and pulled from the fast withering corn with a good handful he went back to bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got some soft paper he said sitting down again and beginning the task <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert watched with interest but really had no idea of doing wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed harry giving the ends of the cigarette a twist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at this moment his eyes closed involuntarily to receive more resolutely the terrible avalanche which was about to fall on his head and a gleam like that of lightning passed across the scaffold van baerle bade farewell to the great black tulip certain of awaking in another world full of light and glorious three times he felt with a shudder the cold current of air from the knife near his neck but what a surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt he saw no change in the colour of the sky or of the world then suddenly van baerle felt gentle hands raising him and he looked around him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was some one by his side reading a large parchment sealed with a huge seal of red and the same sun yellow and pale as it behooves a dutch sun to be was shining in the skies and the same grated window looked down upon him from the buytenhof and the same rabble no longer yelling but completely thunderstruck van baerle began to be sensible to what was going on around his highness william prince of orange very likely afraid that van baerles blood would turn the scale of judgment against him had compassionately taken into consideration his good character and the apparent proofs of his cornelius at first hoped that the pardon would be complete and that he would be restored to his full liberty and to his but cornelius was mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to use an expression of madame de sevigne who wrote about the same time there was a postscript to the letter and the most important part of in this postscript william of orange stadtholder of holland condemned cornelius van baerle to imprisonment for life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not sufficiently guilty to suffer death but he cornelius heard this clause but the first feeling of never mind all this is not lost yet there is some good in this perpetual imprisonment rosa will be there and also my but cornelius forgot that the seven provinces had seven prisons one for each and that the board of the prisoner is anywhere else less expensive than at the hague which is a his highness who as it seems did not possess the means to feed van baerle at the hague sent him to undergo his perpetual imprisonment at the fortress of loewestein very near dort but alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also very far from it for loewestein as the geographers tell us is situated at the point of the islet which is formed by the confluence of the waal and the van baerle was sufficiently versed in the history of his country to know that the celebrated grotius was confined in that castle after the death of barneveldt and that the states in their generosity to the illustrious publicist jurist historian poet and divine had granted to him for i said van baerle to himself i am worth much less than grotius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will hardly give me twelve stivers and i shall live miserably but never mind at all events i shall ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed how damp and misty that part of the country is and the soil so bad for the tulips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then whilst cornelius was engaged with his own thoughts a coach had driven up to the scaffold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this vehicle was for the his last look was towards the buytenhof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hoped to see at but the coach was drawn by good horses who soon carried van baerle away from among the shouts which the rabble roared in honour of the most magnanimous stadtholder mixing with it a spice of abuse against the brothers de witt and the godson this reprieve suggested to the worthy spectators remarks its very fortunate that we used such speed in having justice done to that great villain john and to that little rogue cornelius otherwise his highness might have snatched among all the spectators whom van baerles execution had attracted to the buytenhof and whom the sudden turn of affairs had disagreeably surprised undoubtedly the one most disappointed was a certain respectably dressed burgher who from early morning had made such a good use of his feet and elbows that he at last was separated from the scaffold only many had shown themselves eager to see the perfidious blood of the guilty cornelius flow but not one had shown such a the most furious had come to the buytenhof at daybreak to secure a better place but he outdoing even them had passed the night at the threshold of the prison from whence as we have already said he had advanced to the very foremost rank unguibus et rostro that is to say and when the executioner had conducted the prisoner to the scaffold the burgher who had mounted on the stone of the pump the better to see and be seen made to the executioner the executioner answered by another sign which was meant to this burgher was no other than mynheer isaac boxtel who since the arrest of cornelius had come to the hague to try if he could not get hold of the three bulbs of the black boxtel had at first tried to gain over gryphus to his interest but the jailer had not only the snarling fierceness but likewise the fidelity of a dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had therefore bristled up at boxtels hatred whom he had suspected to be a warm friend of the prisoner making trifling inquiries to contrive with the more certainty some thus to the very first proposals which boxtel made to gryphus to filch the bulbs which cornelius van baerle must be supposed to conceal if not in his breast at least in some corner of his cell the surly jailer had only answered the piece which the mastiff had torn from his hose did not discourage boxtel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came back to the charge but this time gryphus was in bed feverish and with a broken arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he therefore was not able to admit the petitioner who then addressed himself to rosa offering to buy her a headdress of pure gold if she would get the bulbs for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this the generous girl although not yet knowing the value of the object of the robbery which was to be so well remunerated had directed the tempter to the executioner as the heir of in the meanwhile the sentence had been pronounced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus isaac had no more time to bribe any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he therefore clung to the idea which rosa had suggested he went to the isaac had not the least doubt that cornelius would die with but there were two things which boxtel did not calculate but for rosa and william the calculations of the envious but for rosa cornelius would have died with his bulbs on mynheer boxtel went to the headsman to whom he gave himself out as a great friend of the condemned man and from whom he bought all the clothes of the dead man that was to be for one hundred guilders rather an exorbitant sum as he engaged to leave all the trinkets of gold and silver to the but what was the sum of a hundred guilders to a man who was all but sure to buy with it the prize of the haarlem it was money lent at a thousand per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which as nobody the headsman on the other hand had scarcely anything to do to earn his hundred guilders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he needed only as soon as the execution was over to allow mynheer boxtel to ascend the scaffold with his servants to remove the inanimate remains the thing was moreover quite customary among the faithful brethren when one of their masters died a public death in a fanatic like cornelius might very easily have found another fanatic who would give a hundred guilders for his the executioner also readily acquiesced in the proposal boxtel like the people who enter a show at a fair might be after this the reader may imagine how excited boxtel was with what anxiety he watched the guards the recorder and the executioner and with what intense interest he surveyed the movements of van baerle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how would he place himself on the block <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and would he not in falling crush those inestimable bulbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had not he at least taken care to enclose them in a golden box as gold is the every trifling delay irritated him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did that stupid executioner thus lose time in brandishing his sword over the but when he saw the recorder take the hand of the condemned and raise him whilst drawing forth the parchment from his pocket when he heard the pardon of the stadtholder publicly read out then boxtel was no more like a human being the rage and malice of the tiger of the hyena and of the serpent glistened in his eyes and vented itself in his yell and his movements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he been able to get at van and so then cornelius was to live and was to go with him to loewestein and thither to his prison he would take with him his bulbs and perhaps he would even find a garden where boxtel quite overcome by his frenzy fell from the stone upon some orangemen who like him were sorely vexed at the turn which affairs had taken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they mistaking the frantic cries of mynheer isaac for demonstrations of joy began to belabour him with kicks and cuffs such as could not have been administered in better style by any prizefighter on blows were however nothing to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted to run after the coach which was carrying away cornelius with his bulbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in his hurry he overlooked a pavingstone in his way stumbled lost his centre of gravity rolled over to a distance of some yards and only rose again bruised and begrimed after the whole rabble of the hague with their one would think that this was enough for one day but mynheer boxtel did not seem to think so as in addition to having his clothes torn his back bruised and his hands scratched he inflicted upon himself the further punishment of tearing out his hair by handfuls as an offering to that goddess of envy who as mythology teaches us wears a it was indeed in itself a great honour for cornelius van baerle to be confined in the same prison which had once but on arriving at the prison he met with an honour even greater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as chance would have it the cell formerly inhabited by the illustrious barneveldt happened to be vacant when the clemency of the prince of orange sent the the cell had a very bad character at the castle since the time when grotius by means of the device of his wife made escape from it in that famous bookchest which the jailers on the other hand it seemed to van baerle an auspicious omen that this very cell was assigned to him for according to his ideas a jailer ought never to have given to a second the cell had an historical character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will only state here that with the exception of an alcove which was contrived there for the use of madame grotius it differed in no respect from the other cells of the prison only perhaps it was a little higher and had a splendid view cornelius felt himself perfectly indifferent as to the place where he had to lead an existence which was little more than vegetation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were only two things now for which he cared and the possession of which was a happiness enjoyed a flower and a woman both of them as he conceived lost fortunately the good doctor was mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his prison cell the most adventurous life which ever fell to the lot of any one morning whilst at his window inhaling the fresh air which came from the river and casting a longing look to the windmills of his dear old city dort which were looming in the distance behind a forest of chimneys he saw flocks of pigeons coming from that quarter to perch fluttering on the these pigeons van baerle said to himself are coming from dort and consequently may return there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by fastening a little note to the wing of one of these pigeons one might have a chance to send a message there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then after a few a man grows very patient who is twentyeight years of age and condemned to a prison for life that is to say to something like twentytwo or twentythree thousand days of van baerle from whose thoughts the three bulbs were never absent made a snare for catching the pigeons baiting the birds with all the resources of his kitchen such as it was for eight slivers sixpence english a day and after a month of unsuccessful attempts he at last caught a female it cost him two more months to catch a male bird he then shut them up together and having about the beginning of the year obtained some eggs from them he released the female which leaving the male behind to hatch the eggs in her stead flew joyously to dort with the note under her thus it went on for fifteen days at first to the van baerle had addressed it to his nurse the old frisian woman and implored any charitable soul who might find it to van baerles nurse had received the letter in the following leaving dort mynheer isaac boxtel had abandoned not only his house his servants his observatory and his telescope the servant having been left without wages first lived on seeing this the pigeons emigrated from the roof of isaac the nurse was a kindhearted woman who could not live without something to love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she conceived an affection for the pigeons which had thrown themselves on her hospitality and when boxtels servant reclaimed them with culinary intentions having eaten the first fifteen already and now wishing to eat the other fifteen she offered to buy them this being just double their value the man was very glad to close the bargain and the nurse found herself in undisputed in the course of their wanderings these pigeons with others visited the hague loewestein and rotterdam seeking variety doubtless in the flavour of their wheat or chance or rather god for we can see the hand of god in everything had willed that cornelius van baerle should therefore if the envious wretch had not left dort to follow his rival to the hague in the first place and then to gorcum or to loewestein for the two places are separated only by the confluence of the waal and the meuse van baerles letter would have fallen into his hands and not the nurses in which event the poor prisoner like the raven of the roman cobbler would have thrown away his time his trouble and instead of having to relate the series of exciting events which are about to flow from beneath our pen like the varied hues of a many coloured tapestry we should have naught to describe but a weary waste of days dull and and also it came to pass that one evening in the beginning of february just when the stars were beginning to twinkle cornelius heard on the staircase of the little turret a let us confess it cornelius was not so stupefied with surprise or so beyond himself with joy as he would have been but for the pigeon which in answer to his letter had brought back hope to him under her empty wing and knowing rosa he expected if the note had ever reached her to hear he rose listened once more and bent forward towards the yes they were indeed the accents which had fallen so the question now was whether rosa who had made the journey from the hague to loewestein and who cornelius did not understand how had succeeded even in penetrating into the prison would also be fortunate enough in penetrating to the whilst cornelius debating this point within himself was building all sorts of castles in the air and was struggling between hope and fear the shutter of the grating in the door opened and rosa beaming with joy and beautiful in her pretty national costume but still more beautiful from the grief which for the last five months had blanched her cheeks pressed her little face against the wire grating cornelius stretched out his arms and looking to heaven hush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us speak low my father follows on my heels yes he is in the courtyard at the bottom of the staircase receiving the instructions of the governor he will listen to me ill try to tell you all in a few words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stadtholder has a countryhouse one league distant from leyden properly speaking a kind of large dairy and my aunt who was his nurse has the management of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i received your letter which alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not read myself but which your housekeeper read to me i hastened to my aunt there i remained until the prince should come to the dairy and when he came i asked him as a favour to allow my father to exchange his post at the prison of the hague with the jailer of the fortress of loewestein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prince could not have suspected my object had he known it he would have refused my request but as it is he granted a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said you make no great pretensions cornelius tenderly stretched out his hands towards her but they were only able to touch each other with the tips of rosa then abruptly drew back from the door and ran to meet old gryphus who made his appearance at the top of the the turnkey took the animal round the jail so that if father said rosa here is the famous prison from which oh yes that rogue grotius a friend of that villain barneveldt whom i saw executed when i was a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so grotius and thats the chamber from which he escaped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill answer for it that no one shall escape after him in my and thus opening the door he began in the dark to talk to the dog on his part went up to the prisoner and growling smelled about his legs just as though to ask him what right he had still to be alive after having left the well my master said gryphus holding up his lantern to throw a little light around you see in me your new jailer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am head turnkey and have all the cells under my care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not vicious but im not to be trifled with as far as my good master gryphus i know you perfectly well said the prisoner approaching within the circle of light cast halloa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats you mynheer van baerle said gryphus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats you well i declare its astonishing how people do oh yes and its really a great pleasure to me good master gryphus to see that your arm is doing well as you gryphus knitted his brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now thats just it he said people always make blunders in politics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his highness has granted you your life im sure i should never have done because you are the very man to conspire again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you dissatisfied with the manner in which i have set your arm or with the price that on the contrary growled the jailer you have set it only too well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is some witchcraft in this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after six weeks i was able to use it as if nothing had happened so much so that the doctor of the buytenhof who knows his trade well wanted to break it again to set it in the regular way and promised me that i should have my blessed three months for i said nay as long as i can make the sign of the cross with that arm gryphus was a roman catholic i laugh at but if you laugh at the devil master gryphus you ought ah learned people learned people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i would rather have to guard ten soldiers than one scholar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the soldiers smoke guzzle and get drunk they are gentle as lambs if you only give them brandy or moselle but scholars and drink smoke and fuddle ah yes thats altogether different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they keep sober spend nothing and have their heads always clear to make conspiracies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i tell you at the very outset it wont be such an easy matter for you to conspire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first of all you will have no books no paper and no conjuring book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its books that helped mynheer i assure you master gryphus replied van baerle that if i have entertained the idea of escaping i most decidedly well well said gryphus just look sharp thats what i shall do also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for all that i say his highness has just so look whether the mynheer de witt dont keep very thats very shocking what you say now master gryphus cried van baerle turning away his head to conceal his disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you forget that one of those unfortunate gentlemen yes but i also remember that the one as well as the other was a conspirator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and moreover i am speaking from oh indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> explain that a little to me my good master well then if you had remained on the block of master you would not suffer any longer whereas i will not and whilst the prisoner smiled ironically at the old jailer rosa from the outside answered by a bright smile which it was still light enough to see although indistinctly through the gray haze of the evening the vast expanse of why a very fine and pleasant one said cornelius looking and at this moment the two pigeons scared by the sight and especially by the voice of the stranger left their nest your pigeons cried the jailer your pigeons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has a why then said cornelius the pigeons which a merciful so here we have a breach of the rules already replied gryphus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill tell you one thing that before tomorrow is over your pigeons will first of all you should catch them master gryphus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wont allow these pigeons to be mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i vow they are omittance is no acquittance growled the jailer and i shall certainly wring their necks before twentyfour hours whilst giving utterance to this illnatured promise gryphus put his head out of the window to examine the nest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gave van baerle time to run to the door and squeeze the gryphus quite taken up with the desire of catching the pigeons next day as he had promised he would do saw and heard nothing of this short interlude and after having closed the window he took the arm of his daughter left the cell turned the key twice drew the bolts and went off to he had scarcely withdrawn when cornelius went to the door to listen to the sound of his footsteps and as soon as they had died away he ran to the window and completely rather than expose them to the tender mercies of his bullying jailer he drove away for ever those gentle messengers to whom he owed the happiness of having seen rosa this visit of the jailer his brutal threats and the gloomy prospect of the harshness with which as he had before experienced gryphus watched his prisoners all this was unable to extinguish in cornelius the sweet thoughts and especially the sweet hope which the presence of rosa had he waited eagerly to hear the clock of the tower of the last chime was still vibrating through the air when cornelius heard on the staircase the light step and the rustle of the flowing dress of the fair frisian maid and soon after a light appeared at the little grated window in here i am said rosa out of breath from running up the can you ask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how did you contrive to get here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father falls asleep every evening almost immediately after his supper i then make him lie down a little stupefied with his gin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont say anything about it because thanks to this nap i shall be able to saying these words cornelius put his face so near the corneliuss heart leaped with joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not yet dared to ask rosa what she had done with the precious treasure which did you not give them to me as a thing which was dear to yes but as i have given them to you it seems to me that they would have belonged to me after your death but fortunately you are alive now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how i blessed his highness in my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if god grants to him all the happiness that i have wished him certainly prince william will be the happiest man on earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i looked at the bible of your godfather cornelius i was resolved to bring back to you your bulbs only i did not know how to accomplish it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had however already formed the plan of going to the stadtholder to ask from him for my father the appointment of jailer of loewestein when your housekeeper brought me your letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but your letter only confirmed me the more in my resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then left for what my dear rosa you thought even before receiving my if i thought of it said rosa allowing her love to get and saying these words rosa looked so exceedingly pretty that for the second time cornelius placed his forehead and lips against the wire grating of course we must presume in truth she said with that coquetry which somehow or other is in the heart of every young girl i have often been sorry that i am not able to read but never so much so as when your housekeeper brought me your letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i kept the paper in my hands which spoke to other people and which so you have often regretted not being able to read said troth she said laughing to read all the letters which who <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why in the first place all the students who passed over the buytenhof all the officers who went to parade all the clerks and even the merchants who saw me at my little formerly she answered i got some friend to read them to me which was capital fun but since a certain time well what use is it to attend to all this nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since a since a certain time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed cornelius with a look rosa cast down her eyes blushing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in her sweet confusion she did not observe the lips of cornelius which alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet in spite of this obstacle they communicated to the lips of the young girl the glowing at this sudden outburst of tenderness rosa grew very pale perhaps paler than she had been on the day of the execution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she uttered a plaintive sob closed her fine eyes and fled trying in vain to still the beating of her rosa had fled so precipitately that she completely forgot the worthy master gryphus as the reader may have seen was far from sharing the kindly feeling of his daughter for the there being only five prisoners at loewestein the post of turnkey was not a very onerous one but rather a sort of but the worthy jailer in his zeal had magnified with all the power of his imagination the importance of his office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to him cornelius had swelled to the gigantic proportions of a criminal of the first order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked upon him therefore as the most dangerous of all his prisoners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he watched all his steps and always spoke to him with an angry countenance punishing him for what he called his dreadful three times a day he entered van baerles cell expecting to find him trespassing but cornelius had ceased to correspond since his correspondent was at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is even probable that if cornelius had obtained his full liberty with permission to go wherever he liked the prison with rosa and his bulbs would have appeared to him preferable to any other habitation in the world without rosa and his rosa in fact had promised to come and see him every on the following evening she went up as before with the same mysteriousness and the same precaution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only she had this time resolved within herself not to approach too near the grating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in order however to engage van baerle in a conversation from the very first which would seriously occupy his attention she tendered to him through the grating the three bulbs which were still wrapped up in the but to the great astonishment of rosa van baerle pushed listen to me he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we should risk too much by embarking our whole fortune in one ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only think my dear rosa that the question is to carry out an enterprise which until now has been considered impossible namely that of making the great black tulip flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us therefore take every possible precaution so that in case of a failure we may not have anything to reproach ourselves with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will now rosa was all attention to what he would say much more on account of the importance which the unfortunate tulipfancier attached to it than that she felt interested i will explain to you rosa he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dare say you have in this fortress a small garden or some courtyard or if we have a very fine garden said rosa it runs along the could you bring me some soil from the garden that i may take some from a sunny spot and some from a shady so that i may judge of its properties in a dry and in a moist after having chosen the soil and if it be necessary modified it we will divide our three bulbs you will take one and plant it on the day that i will tell you in the soil chosen by me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is sure to flower if you tend it you will give me another which i will try to grow here in my cell and which will help me to beguile those long weary hours when i cannot see you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i confess to you i have very little hope for the latter one and i look beforehand on this unfortunate bulb as sacrificed to my selfishness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however the sun sometimes visits me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will besides try to convert everything into an artificial help even the heat and the ashes of my pipe and lastly we or rather you will keep in reserve the third sucker as our last resource in case our first two experiments should prove a failure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this manner my dear rosa it is impossible that we should not succeed in gaining the hundred thousand guilders for your marriage portion and how dearly shall we enjoy that supreme happiness of seeing our work brought to a successful i know it all now said rosa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will bring you the soil tomorrow and you will choose it for your bulb and for mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to that in which yours is to grow i shall have several journeys to convey it to you as i cannot bring much there is no hurry for it dear rosa our tulips need not be put into the ground for a month at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you see we have plenty of time before us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only i hope that in planting your and when you have once planted it you will communicate to me all the circumstances which may interest our nursling such as change of weather footprints on the walks or footprints in the borders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will listen at night whether our garden is not resorted to by cats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a couple of those on moonlight nights have you ever looked at your garden my well on moonlight nights you will observe whether any rats come out from the holes in the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rats are most mischievous by their gnawing everything and i have heard unfortunate tulipgrowers complain most bitterly of noah for you will apprise me of it thats right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and moreover van baerle having become mistrustful in his captivity continued there is an animal much more to be feared than man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you comprehend my dear rosa a man may steal a guilder and risk the prison for such a trifle and consequently it is much more likely that some one might thank you thank you my dear rosa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the joy of my life and as the lips of van baerle approached the grating with the same ardor as the day before and as moreover the hour for retiring had struck rosa drew back her head and in this pretty little hand of which the coquettish damsel cornelius kissed most tenderly the tips of her fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did he do so because the hand kept one of the bulbs of the great black tulip or because this hand was rosas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall leave rosa withdrew with the other two suckers pressing them to did she press them to her heart because they were the bulbs of the great black tulip or because she had them from this point we believe might be more readily decided than however that may have been from that moment life became rosa as we have seen had returned to him one of the every evening she brought to him handful by handful a quantity of soil from that part of the garden which he had a large jug which cornelius had skilfully broken did service as a flowerpot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he half filled it and mixed the earth of the garden with a small portion of dried river mud then at the beginning of april he planted his first sucker not a day passed on which rosa did not come to have her chat the tulips concerning whose cultivation rosa was taught all the mysteries of the art formed the principal topic of the conversation but interesting as the subject was people they therefore began to chat also about other things and the tulipfancier found out to his great astonishment what a only rosa had made it a habit to keep her pretty face invariably six inches distant from the grating having there was one thing especially which gave cornelius almost as much anxiety as his bulbs a subject to which he always indeed van baerles happiness depended on the whim of this man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might one day find loewestein dull or the air of the place unhealthy or the gin bad and leave the fortress and take his daughter with him when cornelius and rosa of what use would the carrier pigeons then be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said cornelius to rosa as you my dear girl would not be able to read what i should write to you nor to write to me your well answered rosa who in her heart was as much afraid of a separation as cornelius himself we have one hour let us employ it even better said rosa smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> teach me to read and write <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall make the best of your lessons believe me and in this way we shall never be separated will you remain for ever in prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said and after having granted you your life will not his highness also grant you your liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and will you not then recover your fortune and be a rich man and then when you are driving in your own coach riding your own horse will you still look at poor rosa the daughter of a jailer scarcely better cornelius tried to contradict her and certainly he would have done so with all his heart and with all the sincerity she however smilingly interrupted him saying how is to speak to cornelius of his tulip was an expedient resorted very well indeed he said the coat is growing black the sprouting has commenced the veins of the bulb are swelling in eight days hence and perhaps sooner we may distinguish the first buds of the leaves protruding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and oh i have done things on a large scale and according to now let me hear rosa what you have done said cornelius with as tender an anxiety as he had lately shown well she said smiling for in her own heart she could not help studying this double love of the prisoner for herself and for the black tulip i have done things on a large scale i have prepared a bed as you described it to me on a clear spot far from trees and walls in a soil slightly mixed with sand rather moist than dry without a i am now only waiting for your further orders to put in the bulb you know that i must be behindhand with you as i have in my favour all the chances of good air of the sun and all true all true exclaimed cornelius clapping his hands with joy you are a good pupil rosa and you are dont forget said rosa smiling that your pupil as you call me has still other things to learn besides the yes yes and i am as anxious as you are rosa that you oh said rosa i have a book a book which i hope will on the following evening rosa returned with the bible of on the following evening as we have said rosa returned then began between the master and the pupil one of those charming scenes which are the delight of the novelist who the grated window the only opening through which the two lovers were able to communicate was too high for conveniently reading a book although it had been quite rosa therefore had to press the open book against the grating edgewise holding above it in her right hand the lamp but cornelius hit upon the lucky idea of fixing it to the bars so as to afford her a little rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rosa was then enabled to follow with her finger the letters and syllables which she was to spell for cornelius who with a straw pointed out the letters to his attentive pupil through the the light of the lamp illuminated the rich complexion of rosa her blue liquid eyes and her golden hair under her headdress of gold brocade with her fingers held up and showing in the blood as it flowed downwards in the veins that pale pink hue which shines before the light owing to rosas intellect rapidly developed itself under the animating influence of cornelius and when the difficulties seemed too arduous the sympathy of two loving hearts seemed and rosa after having returned to her room repeated in her solitude the reading lessons and at the same time recalled one evening she came half an hour later than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was too extraordinary an instance not to call forth at once oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not be angry with me she said it is not my fault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father has renewed an acquaintance with an old crony who used to visit him at the hague and to ask him to let him see the prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a good sort of fellow fond of his bottle tells funny stories and moreover is very free you dont know anything further of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked cornelius no she answered its only for about a fortnight that my father has taken such a fancy to this friend who is so ah so said cornelius shaking his head uneasily as every new incident seemed to him to forebode some catastrophe very likely some spy one of those who are sent into jails i dont believe that said rosa smiling if that worthy person is spying after any one it is certainly not after my ah thats true cornelius observed with a sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will not always have suitors in vain this man may become thank you rosa you are right well i will say then this this man came several times before to the buytenhof at the hague <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember now it was just about the time when you were confined there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i left he left too when i came here he came after me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the hague his pretext was that he yes it must have undoubtedly been only a pretext for now when he could plead the same reason as you are my fathers prisoner again he does not care any longer for you quite the contrary i heard him say to my father only yesterday go on rosa pray do that i may guess who that man is and are you quite sure mynheer cornelius that none of your i have no friends rosa i have only my old nurse whom you know and who knows you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would come herself and use no roundabout ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would at once say to your father or to you my good sir or my good miss my child is here see how grieved i am let me see him only for one hour and ill pray for you as long as i live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no continued cornelius with the exception of my poor old sue then i come back to what i thought before and the more so as last evening at sunset whilst i was arranging the border where i am to plant your bulb i saw a shadow gliding between the alder trees and the aspens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not appear to see him but it was this man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he concealed himself and saw me digging the ground and certainly it was me whom he followed and me whom he was spying after <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not move my rake or touch one atom of soil without his noticing oh yes yes he is in love with you said cornelius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is saying this he looked anxiously at rosa eagerly waiting for young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried rosa bursting into a laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is hideous to look at crooked nearly fifty years of age and never dares to look me in the face or to speak except in then you see that at all events he does not come after at any rate if he loves you rosa which is very likely well then now as you begin to know how to read you will read all that i write to you of the pangs of jealousy and of then as the turn which the conversation took began to make oh rosa only imagine my joy this morning i looked at it in the sun and after having moved the soil aside which covers the bulb i saw the first sprouting of the leaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this small germ has caused me a much greater emotion than the order of his highness which turned aside the sword oh the first favourable day i will tell you but whatever you do let nobody help you and dont confide your secret to any one in the world do you see a connoisseur by merely looking at the bulb would be able to distinguish its value and so my dearest rosa be careful in locking up the third it is still wrapped up in the same paper in which you put it and just as you gave it me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have laid it at the bottom of my chest under my point lace which keeps it dry without pressing upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but good night my poor captive my father might grow impatient not seeing me return and what is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i heard surely said the prisoner that cannot be master gryphus rosa rushed toward the staircase and a door was really heard rapidly to close before the young damsel had got down cornelius was very uneasy about it but it was after all the flowing day passed without any remarkable incident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gryphus made his three visits and discovered nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never came at the same hours as he hoped thus to discover the secrets of the prisoner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> van baerle therefore had devised a contrivance a sort of pulley by means of which he was able to lower or to raise his jug below the ledge of tiles and stone before his window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strings by which this was effected he had found means to cover with that moss which generally grows on tiles or in the crannies of the gryphus suspected nothing and the device succeeded for eight days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one morning however when cornelius absorbed in the contemplation of his bulb from which a germ of vegetation was already peeping forth had not heard old gryphus coming upstairs as a gale of wind was blowing which gryphus perceiving an unknown and consequently a forbidden object in the hands of his prisoner pounced upon it with as ill luck would have it his coarse hard hand the same which he had broken and which cornelius van baerle had set so well grasped at once in the midst of the jug on the what have you got here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a jug and earth in it there is some oh my good master gryphus said van baerle imploringly and anxious as the partridge robbed of her young by the in fact gryphus was beginning to dig the soil with his take care sir take care said cornelius growing quite and with a rapid and almost frantic movement he snatched the jug from the hands of gryphus and hid it like a treasure but gryphus obstinate like an old man and more and more convinced that he was discovering here a conspiracy against the prince of orange rushed up to his prisoner raising his stick seeing however the impassible resolution of the captive to protect his flowerpot he was convinced that halloa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the jailer furious here you see you are ah yes tulip replied the old man we know well the let go repeated gryphus stamping his foot let go or i call whoever you like but you shall not have this flower gryphus exasperated plunged his finger a second time into the soil and now he drew out the bulb which certainly looked quite black and whilst van baerle quite happy to have saved the vessel did not suspect that the adversary had possessed himself of its precious contents gryphus hurled the softened bulb with all his force on the flags where almost immediately after it was crushed to atoms under van baerle saw the work of destruction got a glimpse of the juicy remains of his darling bulb and guessing the cause of the ferocious joy of gryphus uttered a cry of agony which would have melted the heart even of that ruthless the idea of striking down this spiteful bully passed like lightning through the brain of the tulipfancier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blood rushed to his brow and seemed like fire in his eyes which blinded him and he raised in his two hands the heavy jug with all the now useless earth which remained in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one instant more and he would have flung it on the bald head of but a cry stopped him a cry of agony uttered by poor rosa who trembling and pale with her arms raised to heaven made her appearance behind the grated window and thus gryphus then understood the danger with which he had been threatened and he broke out in a volley of the most indeed said cornelius to him you must be a very mean and spiteful fellow to rob a poor prisoner of his only for shame my father rosa chimed in it is indeed a ah is that you my little chatterbox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man cried boiling with rage and turning towards her dont you meddle with what dont concern you but go down as quickly as unfortunate me continued cornelius overwhelmed with after all it is but a tulip gryphus resumed as he began to be a little ashamed of himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may have as many tulips as you like i have three hundred of them in my to the devil with your tulips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried cornelius you are worthy of each other had i a hundred thousand millions of them i would gladly give them for the one which you have oh so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gryphus said in a tone of triumph now there we have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not your tulip you cared for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was in that false bulb some witchcraft perhaps some means of correspondence with conspirators against his highness who has granted you your life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always said they were wrong in yes yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is better as it is now repeated gryphus growing warm i have destroyed it and ill do the same again as often as you repeat the trick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt i tell you a curse on you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cornelius exclaimed quite beyond himself with despair as he gathered with his trembling fingers the remnants of that bulb on which he had rested so many we shall plant the other tomorrow my dear mynheer cornelius said rosa in a low voice who understood the intense grief of the unfortunate tulipfancier and who with the pure sacred love of her innocent heart poured these kind words like a drop of balm on the bleeding rosa had scarcely pronounced these consolatory words when a voice was heard from the staircase asking gryphus how there was such a noise said gryphus wouldnt you have thought he would murder me this doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are always then pointing with his finger towards the staircase he after this he locked the door and called out i shall be poor cornelius thus left alone with his bitter grief ah you old hangman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is me you have trodden under foot and certainly the unfortunate prisoner would have fallen ill but for the counterpoise which providence had granted to his in the evening she came back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her first words announced to cornelius that henceforth her father would make no objection and how do you know that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prisoner asked with a ah master jacob he does not leave you then that master saying this she smiled in such a way that the little cloud of jealousy which had darkened the brow of cornelius well being asked by his friend my father told at supper the whole story of the tulip or rather of the bulb and of cornelius heaved a sigh which might have been called a had you only seen master jacob at that moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i really thought he would set fire to the castle his eyes were like two flaming torches his hair stood on end and he clinched his fist for a moment i thought he would you have done that he cried you have crushed the it is infamous said master jacob it is odious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you oh what a worthy man is this master jacob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> muttered cornelius an honest soul an excellent heart that he the truth is that it is impossible to treat a man more rudely than he did my father he was really quite in then turning toward me he asked but it was not the only you think it was not the only one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very you will search for the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried jacob taking my father by the collar but he immediately loosed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then turning towards me he continued asking and what did that i did not know what to answer as you had so strictly enjoined me never to allow any one to guess the interest which you are taking in the bulb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately my father i interrupted him saying was it not natural that be well now are you mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried my father what immense misfortune is it to crush a tulip bulb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may buy a perhaps some less precious one than that was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i quite and what did jacob say or do at these words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked at these words if i must say it his eyes seemed to flash but said cornelius that was not all i am sure he said so then my pretty rosa he said with a voice as sweet a honey so you think that bulb to have been a precious what do i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said negligently do i understand anything of tulips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only know as unfortunately it is our lot to live with prisoners that for them any pastime is of value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this poor mynheer van baerle amused himself with this bulb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i think it very cruel to take from him but first of all said my father we ought to know how i turned my eyes away to avoid my fathers look but i met it was as if he had tried to read my thoughts at the bottom some little show of anger sometimes saves an answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shrugged my shoulders turned my back and advanced towards but i was kept by something which i heard although it was you need only search his person and if he has the other bulbs we shall find them as there usually are three three suckers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you say that i have the word certainly struck me just as much as it does you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were both of them so deeply engaged in but said my father perhaps he has not got his bulbs then take him down under some pretext or other and i will halloa halloa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacob of did you not tell me that on the day when you prepared your go tomorrow into the garden manage matters so that jacob may know as he did the first time that you are going there and that he may follow you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> feign to put the bulb into the ground leave the garden but look through the oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said rosa with a sigh you are very fond of your to tell the truth said the prisoner sighing likewise since your father crushed that unfortunate bulb i feel as now just hear me said rosa will you try something accept two or three and along with them you may grow the yes that would do very well said cornelius knitting his brow if your father were alone but there is that master well that is true but only think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are depriving she pronounced these words with a smile which was not cornelius reflected for a moment he evidently was no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried at last with the stoicism of a roman of old it would be a weakness it would be a folly it would be a meanness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i thus give up the only and last resource which we possess to the uncertain chances of the bad passions of anger and envy i should never deserve to be forgiven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no rosa no tomorrow we shall come to a conclusion as to the spot to be chosen for your tulip you will plant it according to my instructions and as to the third sucker cornelius here heaved a deep sigh watch over it as a miser over his first or last piece of gold as the mother over her child as the wounded over the last drop of blood in his veins watch over it rosa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some voice within me tells me that it will be our saving that it will be a be easy mynheer cornelius said rosa with a sweet mixture of melancholy and gravity be easy your wishes are and even continued van baerle warming more and more with his subject if you should perceive that your steps are watched and that your speech has excited the suspicion of your father and of that detestable master jacob well rosa dont hesitate for one moment to sacrifice me who am only still living through you me who have no one in the world but you sacrifice me dont come to see me any rosa felt her heart sink within her and her eyes were i see said she bursting out in sobs i see that you love your tulips with such love as to have no more room in cornelius after this passed one of the worst nights he rosa was vexed with him and with good reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps she would never return to see the prisoner and then he would we have to confess to the disgrace of our hero and of floriculture that of his two affections he felt most strongly inclined to regret the loss of rosa and when at about three in the morning he fell asleep overcome with fatigue and harassed with remorse the grand black tulip yielded precedence in his dreams to the sweet blue eyes of but poor rosa in her secluded chamber could not have known from what he had said she was more ready to believe that he dreamed of the black tulip than of her and yet rosa was but as there was no one to tell her so and as the words of corneliuss thoughtless speech had fallen upon her heart the fact was that as rosa was a highspirited creature of no mean perception and a noble heart she took a very clear and judicious view of her own social position if not of her cornelius was a scholar and was wealthy at least he had been before the confiscation of his property cornelius belonged to the merchantbourgeoisie who were prouder of their richly emblazoned shop signs than the hereditary nobility of their heraldic bearings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore although he might find rosa a pleasant companion for the dreary hours of his captivity when it came to a question of bestowing his heart it was almost certain that he would bestow it upon a tulip that is to say upon the proudest and noblest of flowers rather than upon poor rosa the jailers lowly thus rosa understood corneliuss preference of the tulip to during the whole of this terrible night the poor girl did not close an eye and before she rose in the morning she had come to the resolution of making her appearance at the but as she knew with what ardent desire cornelius looked forward to the news about his tulip and as notwithstanding her determination not to see any more a man her pity for whose fate was fast growing into love she did not on the other hand wish to drive him to despair she resolved to continue by herself the reading and writing lessons and fortunately she had made sufficient progress to dispense with the help of a master when the master was not to be rosa therefore applied herself most diligently to reading poor cornelius de witts bible on the second fly leaf of alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she muttered when perusing again this document which she never finished without a tear the pearl of love rolling from her limpid eyes on her pale cheeks alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had the love of the prisoner been more sincere than at the time at which we are now arrived when in the contest between the black tulip and rosa the tulip had had to yield to her the first and having finished reading she took her pen and began with as laudable diligence the by far more difficult task of as however rosa was already able to write a legible hand when cornelius so uncautiously opened his heart she did not despair of progressing quickly enough to write after eight she had not forgotten one word of the directions given to her by cornelius whose speeches she treasured in her heart he on his part awoke deeper in love than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tulip indeed was still a luminous and prominent object in his mind but he no longer looked upon it as a treasure to which he ought to sacrifice everything and even rosa but as a marvellous combination of nature and art with which he would yet during the whole of that day he was haunted with a vague uneasiness at the bottom of which was the fear lest rosa should not come in the evening to pay him her usual visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this thought took more and more hold of him until at the how his heart beat when darkness closed in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the words which he had said to rosa on the evening before and which had so deeply afflicted her now came back to his mind more vividly than ever and he asked himself how he could have told his gentle comforter to sacrifice him to his tulip that is to say to give up seeing him if need be whereas to him in corneliuss cell one heard the chimes of the clock of the fortress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it struck seven it struck eight it struck nine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never did the metal voice vibrate more forcibly through the heart of any man than did the last stroke marking the ninth all was then silent again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cornelius put his hand on his heart to repress as it were its violent palpitation and the noise of her footstep the rustling of her gown on the staircase were so familiar to his ear that she had no this evening none of those little noises broke the silence of the lobby the clock struck nine and a quarter the halfhour then a quarter to ten and at last its deep tone announced not only to the inmates of the fortress but also this was the hour at which rosa generally used to leave thus then his foreboding had not deceived him rosa being alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought i have deserved all this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she will come no more and she is right in staying away in her place i yet notwithstanding all this cornelius listened waited and hoped until midnight then he threw himself upon the it was a long and sad night for him and the day brought no at eight in the morning the door of his cell opened but cornelius did not even turn his head he had heard the heavy step of gryphus in the lobby but this step had perfectly and yet he would have been so glad to draw him out and to inquire about rosa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he even very nearly made this inquiry strange as it would needs have appeared to her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to tell the truth there was in all this some selfish hope to except on extraordinary occasions rosa never came during the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cornelius therefore did not really expect her as long as the day lasted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet his sudden starts his listening at the door his rapid glances at every little noise towards the grated window showed clearly that the prisoner entertained some latent hope that rosa would somehow or at the second visit of gryphus cornelius contrary to all his former habits asked the old jailer with the most winning voice about her health but gryphus contented at the third visit of the day cornelius changed his former nobody replied even more laconically the jailer gryphus being little used to this sort of civility on the part of cornelius began to suspect that his prisoner was cornelius was now alone once more it was seven oclock in the evening and the anxiety of yesterday returned with but another time the hours passed away without bringing the sweet vision which lighted up through the grated window the cell of poor cornelius and which in retiring left van baerle passed the night in an agony of despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the following day gryphus appeared to him even more hideous brutal and hateful than usual in his mind or rather in his heart there had been some hope that it was the old man in his wrath he would have strangled gryphus but would not the evening closing in his despair changed into melancholy which was the more gloomy as involuntarily van baerle mixed up with it the thought of his poor tulip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was now just that week in april which the most experienced gardeners point out as the precise time when tulips ought to be i shall tell you the day when you are to put the bulb in he had intended to fix at the vainly hoped for interview the following day as the time for that momentous operation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the weather was propitious the air though still damp began to be tempered by those pale rays of the april sun which being the first appear so congenial although so pale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how if rosa allowed the right moment for planting the bulb to pass by if in addition to the grief of seeing her no more he should have to deplore the misfortune of seeing his tulip fail on account of its having been planted these two vexations combined might well make him leave off it was pitiful to see cornelius dumb with grief and pale from utter prostration stretch out his head through the iron bars of his window at the risk of not being able to draw it back again to try and get a glimpse of the garden on the left spoken of by rosa who had told him that its parapet overlooked the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hoped that perhaps he might see in the light of the april sun rosa or the tulip the in the evening gryphus took away the breakfast and dinner on the following day he did not touch them at all and well said gryphus coming down from the last visit i he doesnt drink he doesnt eat he doesnt leave his bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will get out of it like mynheer grotius in a chest and rising with a heavy heart she returned to her chamber where she took a pen and paper and during the whole of that on the following morning when cornelius got up to drag himself to the window he perceived a paper which had been he pounced upon it opened it and read the following words in a handwriting which he could scarcely have recognized as that of rosa so much had she improved during her short although these few words of rosas somewhat soothed the grief of cornelius yet he felt not the less the irony which was at the bottom of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rosa then was not ill she was offended she had not been forcibly prevented from coming but had voluntarily stayed away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus rosa being at liberty found in her own will the force not to come and see cornelius had paper and a pencil which rosa had brought to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he guessed that she expected an answer but that she would not come before the evening to fetch it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he therefore wrote on a piece of paper similar to that which he had it was not my anxiety about the tulip that has made me ill after gryphus had made his last visit of the day and darkness had set in he slipped the paper under the door and listened with the most intense attention but he neither he only heard a voice as feeble as a breath and gentle like a caress which whispered through the grated little window now tomorrow was the eighth day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why then said trotty seizing him by the arm and looking cautiously round for heavens sake dont go to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell put you down as sure as ever you were born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come up this alley and ill tell you what i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his new acquaintance looked as if he thought him mad but he bore him company nevertheless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were shrouded from observation trotty told him what he knew and what character he the subject of his history listened to it with a calmness that surprised him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not contradict or interrupt it once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he nodded his head now and then more in corroboration of an old and wornout story it appeared than in refutation of it and once or twice threw back his hat and passed his freckled hand over a brow where every furrow he had ploughed seemed to have set its image in its true enough in the main he said master i could sift grain from husk here and there but let it be as tis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have gone against his plans to my misfortun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant help it i should do the like tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to character them gentlefolks will search and search and pry and pry and have it as free from spot or speck in us afore theyll help us to a dry good word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope they dont lose good opinion as easy as we do or their lives is strict indeed and hardly worth the keeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for myself master i never took with that hand holding it before him what wasnt my own and never held it back from work however hard or poorly paid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whoever can deny it let him chop it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when work wont maintain me like a human creetur when my living is so bad that i am hungry out of doors and in when i see a whole working life begin that way go on that way and end that way without a chance or change then i say to the gentlefolks keep away from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my doors is dark enough without your darkening of em more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont look for me to come up into the park to help the show when theres a birthday or a fine speechmaking or what not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> act your plays and games without me and be welcome to em and enjoy em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve nowt to do with one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing that the child in his arms had opened her eyes and was looking about her in wonder he checked himself to say a word or two of foolish prattle in her ear and stand her on the ground beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then slowly winding one of her long tresses round and round his rough forefinger like a ring while she hung about his im not a crossgrained man by natu i believe and easy satisfied im sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bear no illwill against none of em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only want to live like one of the almightys creeturs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant i dont and so theres a pit dug between me and them that can and do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might tell em off by hundreds and by thousands sooner than by ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trotty knew he spoke the truth in this and shook his head to ive got a bad name this way said fern and im not likely im afeared to get a better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tant lawful to be out of sorts and i am out of sorts though god knows id sooner bear a cheerful spirit if i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know as this alderman could hurt me much by sending me to jail but without a friend to speak a word for me he might do it and you see  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pointing downward with his why yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied the other in a low voice as he gently turned it up with both his hands towards his own and looked upon it steadfastly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive thought so when my hearth was very cold and cupboard very bare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought so tother night when we were taken like two thieves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they they shouldnt try the little face too often should they lilian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats hardly fair upon a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sunk his voice so low and gazed upon her with an air so stern and strange that toby to divert the current of his thoughts i never had one he returned shaking his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes my brothers child a orphan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nine year old though youd hardly think it but shes tired and worn out now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd have taken care on her the union eightandtwenty mile away from where we live between four walls as they took care of my old father when he couldnt work no more though he didnt trouble em long but i took her instead and shes lived with me ever since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her mother had a friend once in london here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are trying to find her and to find work too but its a large place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more room for us to walk about in lilly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meeting the childs eyes with a smile which melted toby more than i dont so much as know your name he said but ive opened my heart free to you for im thankful to you with good reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if thats the name they give him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and tomorrow will try whether theres better fortun to be met with somewheres near london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried trotty catching at his hand as he relaxed his grip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the new year never can be happy to me if we part like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the new year never can be happy to me if i see the child and you go wandering away you dont know where without a shelter for your heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a poor man living in a poor place but i can give you lodging for one night and never miss it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried trotty lifting up the child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id carry twenty times her weight and never know id got it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me if i go too quick for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trotty said this taking about six of his trotting paces to one stride of his fatigued companion and with his thin legs quivering again beneath the load why shes as light said trotty trotting in his speech as well as in his gait for he couldnt bear to be thanked and dreaded a moments pause as light as a feather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lighter than a peacocks feather a great deal lighter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we are and here we go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> round this first turning to the right uncle will and past the pump and sharp off up the passage to the left right opposite the public house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we are and here we go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cross over uncle will and mind the kidney pieman at the corner <end> <end>

<start> <start> veck ticket porter wrote upon a board and here we are and here we go and here we are indeed my precious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with which words trotty in a breathless state set the child down before his daughter in the middle of the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little visitor looked once at meg and doubting nothing in that face but trusting here we are and here we go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried trotty running round the room and choking audibly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here uncle will heres a fire you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont you come to the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh here we are and here we go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg my precious darling wheres the kettle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here it is and here it goes and itll bile in no time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trotty really had picked up the kettle somewhere or other in the course of his wild career and now put it on the fire while meg seating the child in a warm corner knelt down on the ground before her and pulled off her shoes and dried her wet feet on a cloth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay and she laughed at trotty too so pleasantly so cheerfully that trotty could have blessed her where she kneeled for he had why father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what the bells would say to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we havent rubbed em half enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when theyre done well brush out the damp hair and when thats done well bring some colour to the poor pale face with fresh water and when thats done well be so gay and brisk and happy  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the child in a burst of sobbing clasped her round the neck caressed her fair cheek with its hand and said oh meg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes put the dear childs bonnet on the kettle and hung the lid behind the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt go for to do it my love said trotty hastily repairing this mistake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg looked towards him and saw that he had elaborately stationed himself behind the chair of their male visitor where with many i see my dear said trotty as i was coming in half an ounce of tea lying somewhere on the stairs and im pretty sure there was a bit of bacon too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i dont remember where it was exactly ill go myself and try to find em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this inscrutable artifice toby withdrew to purchase the viands he had spoken of for ready money at mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chickenstalkers and presently came back pretending he had not been able to find but here they are at last said trotty setting out the tea things all correct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was pretty sure it was tea and a rasher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg my pet if youll just make the tea while your unworthy father toasts the bacon we shall be ready immediate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a curious circumstance said trotty proceeding in his cookery with the assistance of the toastingfork curious but well known to my friends that i never care myself for rashers nor for tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like to see other people enjoy em said trotty speaking very loud to impress the fact upon his guest but to me as food theyre disagreeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet trotty sniffed the savour of the hissing bacon ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as if he liked it and when he poured the boiling water in the teapot looked lovingly down into the depths of that snug cauldron and suffered the fragrant steam to curl about his nose and wreathe his head and face in a thick cloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however for all this he neither ate nor drank except at the very beginning a mere morsel for forms sake which he appeared to eat with infinite relish but no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trottys occupation was to see will fern and lilian eat and drink and so was megs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and never did spectators at a city dinner or court banquet find such high delight in seeing others feast although it were a monarch or a pope as those two did in looking on that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg smiled at trotty trotty laughed at meg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg shook her head and made belief to clap her hands applauding trotty trotty conveyed in dumbshow unintelligible narratives of how and when and where he had found their visitors to meg and although thought trotty sorrowfully as he watched megs face that match is broken off i see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ill tell you what said trotty after tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little one she sleeps with meg i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i shouldnt wonder if she kiss megs father wont she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mightily delighted trotty was when the child went timidly towards shes as sensible as solomon said trotty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we come and here we no we dont i dont mean that i what was i saying meg my precious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meg looked towards their guest who leaned upon her chair and with his face turned from her fondled the childs head half hidden in to be sure said toby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what im rambling on about tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wits are woolgathering i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will fern you come along with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre tired to death and broken down for want of rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man still played with the childs curls still leaned upon megs chair still turned away his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he didnt speak but in his rough coarse fingers clenching and expanding in the fair hair of the yes yes said trotty answering unconsciously what he saw expressed in his daughters face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now will ill show you where you lie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not much of a place only a loft but having a loft i always say is one of the great conveniences of living in a mews and till this coachhouse and stable gets a better let we live here cheap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres plenty of sweet hay up there belonging to a neighbour and its as clean as hands and meg can make it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a new heart for a new year always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hand released from the childs hair had fallen trembling into trottys hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so trotty talking without intermission led him out as tenderly and easily as if he had been a child himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returning before meg he listened for an instant at the door of her little chamber an adjoining room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the child was murmuring a simple prayer before lying down to sleep and when she had remembered megs name dearly dearly so her words ran trotty it was some short time before the foolish little old fellow could compose himself to mend the fire and draw his chair to the warm hearth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when he had done so and had trimmed the light he took his newspaper from his pocket and began to read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carelessly at first and skimming up and down the columns but with an earnest for this same dreaded paper redirected trottys thoughts into the channel they had taken all that day and which the days events had so marked out and shaped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his interest in the two wanderers had set him on another course of thinking and a happier one for the time but being alone again and reading of the crimes and in this mood he came to an account and it was not the first he had ever read of a woman who had laid her desperate hands not only on her own life but on that of her young child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a crime so terrible and so revolting to his soul dilated with the love of meg that he let the journal drop and fell back in his chair unnatural and cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none but people who were bad at heart born bad who had no business on the earth could do such deeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its too true all ive heard today too just too full of proof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chimes took up the words so suddenly burst out so loud and clear and sonorous that the bells seemed to strike him in his toby veck toby veck waiting for you toby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toby veck toby veck waiting for you toby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come and see us come and see us drag him to us drag him to us haunt and hunt him haunt and hunt him break his slumbers break his slumbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toby veck toby veck door open wide toby toby veck toby veck door open wide toby then fiercely back to their impetuous strain again and ringing in the toby listened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his remorse for having run away from them that afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again again and yet a dozen times again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> haunt and hunt him haunt and hunt meg said trotty softly tapping at her door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant leave her yet though father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look how she holds my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she listened with her face towards him all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it trotty withdrew resumed his seat by the fire and once more if the towerdoor is really open said toby hastily laying aside his apron but never thinking of his hat whats to hinder me from going up into the steeple and satisfying myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if its shut i dont want any other satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was pretty certain as he slipped out quietly into the street that he should find it shut and locked for he knew the door well and had so rarely seen it open that he couldnt reckon above three times in all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a low arched portal outside the church in a dark nook behind a column and had such great iron hinges and such but what was his astonishment when coming bareheaded to the church and putting his hand into this dark nook with a certain misgiving that it might be unexpectedly seized and a shivering propensity to draw it back again he found that the door which he thought on the first surprise of going back or of getting a light or a companion but his courage aided him immediately and what have i to fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides the ringers may be there and have forgotten to shut the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he went in feeling his way as he went like a blind man for it was the dust from the street had blown into the recess and lying there heaped up made it so soft and velvetlike to the foot that there was something startling even in that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the narrow stair was so close to the door too that he stumbled at the very first and shutting the door upon himself by striking it with his foot and this was another reason however for going on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trotty groped his way and went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up up up and round and round and up up it was a disagreeable staircase for that groping work so low and narrow that his groping hand was always touching something and it often felt so like a man or ghostly figure standing up erect and making room for him to pass without discovery that he would rub the smooth wall upward searching for its face and downward searching for its feet while a chill tingling crept all over him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice or thrice a door or niche broke the monotonous surface and then it seemed a gap as wide as the whole church and he felt on the brink of an abyss and going to tumble headlong down until he still up up up and round and round and up up up higher at length the dull and stifling atmosphere began to freshen presently to feel quite windy presently it blew so strong that he could hardly keep his legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he got to an arched window in the tower breast high and holding tight looked down upon the housetops on the smoking chimneys on the blurr and blotch of lights towards the place where meg was wondering where he was and calling to him perhaps all kneaded up together in a leaven of this was the belfry where the ringers came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had caught hold of one of the frayed ropes which hung down through apertures in the oaken roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first he started thinking it was hair then trembled at the very thought of waking the deep bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> higher trotty in his fascination or in working out the spell upon him groped his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by ladders now and toilsomely for it was steep and not too certain holding for up up up and climb and clamber up up up higher higher until ascending through the floor and pausing with his head just raised above its beams he came among the bells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was barely possible to make out their great shapes in the gloom but there a heavy sense of dread and loneliness fell instantly upon him as he climbed into this airy nest of stone and metal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his head went round and round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened and then raised a wild holloa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giddy confused and out of breath and frightened toby looked black are the brooding clouds and troubled the deep waters when the sea of thought first heaving from a calm gives up its dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsters uncouth and wild arise in premature imperfect resurrection the several parts and shapes of different things are joined and mixed by chance and when and how and by what wonderful degrees each separates from each and every sense and object of the mind resumes its usual form and lives again no man though every man is every day the casket of this type of the great so when and how the darkness of the nightblack steeple changed to shining light when and how the solitary tower was peopled with a myriad figures when and how the whispered haunt and hunt him breathing monotonously through his sleep or swoon became a voice exclaiming in the waking ears of trotty break his slumbers when and how he ceased to have a sluggish and confused idea that such things were companioning a host of others that were not there are no dates or means to tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but awake and standing on his feet he saw the tower whither his charmed footsteps had brought him swarming with dwarf phantoms spirits elfin creatures of the bells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them leaping flying dropping pouring from the bells without a pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them round him on the ground above him in the air clambering from him by the ropes below looking down upon him from the massive irongirded beams peeping in upon him through the chinks and loopholes in the walls spreading away and away from him in enlarging circles as the water ripples give way to a huge stone that suddenly comes plashing in among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them of all aspects and all shapes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them ugly handsome crippled exquisitely formed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them young he saw them old he saw them kind he saw them cruel he saw them merry he saw them grim he saw them dance and heard them sing he saw them tear their hair and heard them howl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the air thick with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them come and go incessantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them riding downward soaring upward sailing off afar perching near at hand all restless and all violently active <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stone and brick and slate and tile became transparent to him as to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them in the houses busy at the sleepers beds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them soothing people in their dreams he saw them beating them with knotted whips he saw them yelling in their ears he saw them playing softest music on their pillows he saw them cheering some with the songs of birds and the perfume of flowers he saw them flashing awful faces on the troubled rest of others from enchanted mirrors he saw these creatures not only among sleeping men but waking also active in pursuits irreconcilable with one another and possessing or assuming natures the most opposite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw one buckling on innumerable wings to increase his speed another loading himself with chains and weights to retard his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw some putting the hands of clocks forward some putting the hands of clocks backward some endeavouring to stop the clock entirely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them representing here a marriage ceremony there a funeral in this chamber an election in that a ball he saw everywhere bewildered by the host of shifting and extraordinary figures as well as by the uproar of the bells which all this while were ringing trotty clung to a wooden pillar for support and turned as he gazed the chimes stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their forms collapsed their speed deserted them they sought to fly but in the act of falling died and melted into air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one straggler leaped down pretty briskly from the surface of the great bell and alighted on his feet but he was dead and gone before he could turn round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some few of the late company who had gambolled in the tower remained there spinning over and over a little longer but these became at every turn more faint and few and feeble and soon went the way of the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last of all was one small hunchback who had got into an echoing corner where he twirled and twirled and floated by himself a long time showing such perseverance that at last he dwindled to a leg and even to a foot before he finally then and not before did trotty see in every bell a bearded figure of the bulk and stature of the bell incomprehensibly a figure and the bell itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gigantic grave and darkly watchful of him mysterious and awful figures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> resting on nothing poised in the night air of the tower with their draped and hooded heads merged in the dim roof motionless and shadowy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shadowy and dark although he saw them by some light belonging to themselves none he could not plunge down wildly through the opening in the floor for all power of motion had deserted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> otherwise he would have done so aye would have thrown himself headforemost from the steepletop rather than have seen them watching him with eyes that would have waked and watched although the pupils had been taken again again the dread and terror of the lonely place and of the wild and fearful night that reigned there touched him like a spectral hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his distance from all help the long dark winding ghostbeleaguered way that lay between him and the earth on which men lived his being high high high up there where it had made him dizzy to see the birds fly in the day cut off from all good people who at such an hour were safe at home and sleeping in their beds all this struck coldly through him not as a reflection but a bodily sensation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime his eyes and thoughts and fears were fixed upon the watchful figures which rendered unlike any figures of this world by the deep gloom and shade enwrapping and enfolding them as well as by their looks and forms and supernatural hovering above the floor were nevertheless as plainly to be seen as were the stalwart oaken frames crosspieces bars and beams set up there to support the bells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these hemmed them in a very forest of hewn timber from the entanglements intricacies and depths of which as from among the boughs of a dead wood blighted for their phantom use they kept their darksome a blast of air how cold and shrill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it died away the great bell or the goblin of the great what visitor is this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the voice was low and deep and i thought my name was called by the chimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said trotty raising his hands in an attitude of supplication <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hardly know why i am here or how i came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have listened to the chimes these many years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a poor man faltered trotty and could only thank them in words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired the goblin of the bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you never done us wrong in words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never done us foul and false and wicked wrong in words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trotty was about to answer never <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he stopped and was the voice of time said the phantom cries to man advance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time is for his advancement and improvement for his greater worth his greater happiness his better life his progress onward to that goal within its knowledge and its view and set there in the period when time and he began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ages of darkness wickedness and violence have come and gone millions uncountable have suffered lived and died to point the way before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who seeks to turn him back or stay him on his course arrests a mighty engine which will strike the meddler dead and be the fiercer and the wilder ever for its momentary check <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never did so to my knowledge sir said trotty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite by accident if i did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt go to do it im sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who puts into the mouth of time or of its servants said the goblin of the bell a cry of lamentation for days which have had their trial and their failure and have left deep traces of it which the blind may see a cry that only serves the present time by showing men how much it needs their help when any ears can listen to regrets for such a past who does this does a wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you have done that wrong to us the chimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trottys first excess of fear was gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had felt tenderly and gratefully towards the bells as you have seen and when he heard himself arraigned as one who had offended them so weightily if you knew said trotty clasping his hands earnestly or perhaps you do know if you know how often you have kept me company how often you have cheered me up when ive been low how you were quite the plaything of my little daughter meg almost the only one she ever had when first her mother died and she and me were left alone you wont bear malice for a hasty word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who hears in us the chimes one note bespeaking disregard or stern regard of any hope or joy or pain or sorrow of the many sorrowed throng who hears us make response to any creed that gauges human passions and affections as it gauges the amount of miserable food on which humanity may pine and wither does us i have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who hears us echo the dull vermin of the earth the putters down of crushed and broken natures formed to be raised up higher than such maggots of the time can crawl or can conceive pursued the goblin of the bell who does so does us wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you have done us wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lastly and most of all pursued the bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind abandons them as vile and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which they fell from good grasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that lost soil and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in the gulf below does wrong to heaven and man to time and to eternity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you have done that wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried trotty falling on his knees for mercys sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said a clear and childlike voice which trotty thought he the organ sounded faintly in the church below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> swelling by degrees the melody ascended to the roof and filled the choir and nave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> expanding more and more it rose up up up up higher higher higher up awakening agitated hearts within the burly piles of oak the hollow bells the ironbound doors the stairs of solid stone until the tower walls were insufficient to contain it no wonder that an old mans breast could not contain a sound so vast and mighty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it broke from that weak prison in a rush of it was a very low and mournful strain a dirge and as he she is dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spirit of your child bewails the dead and mingles with the dead dead hopes dead fancies dead imaginings of youth returned the bell but she is living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> learn from her life a living truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> learn from the creature dearest to your heart how bad the bad are born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see every bud and leaf plucked one by one from off the fairest stem and know how bare and wretched it may be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each of the shadowy figures stretched its right arm forth and go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trotty turned and saw the child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the child will fern had carried in the street the child whom meg had watched but now i carried her myself tonight said trotty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> show him what he calls himself said the dark figures one and the tower opened at his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked down and beheld his own no more a living man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i missed my way and coming on the outside of this tower in the dark fell down a year ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they gave the answer they recalled their outstretched hands and they rung their time being come again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and once again vast multitudes of phantoms sprung into existence once again were incoherently engaged as they had been before once again faded on what are these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i am not mad what are these <end> <end>

<start> <start> that was a brilliant thought to insinuate tha i folded my masters letters for him the folding is s neat that it does honour to the operator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i once in tended to have insinuated that i wrote his letters too but that was before i saw them it wont do now no honour there positively.nothing looks mor vulgar reading affectedly ordinary and illiberal tha ugly uneven and ragged nails the ends of whic should be kept even and clean not tipped with black and cut in small segments of circles.segments o circles <end> <end>

<start> <start> jessamy if he copies after me h stay here one moment and i will call him.jona than!mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary much worse replied victor unruffled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but were educating ourselves so that when our time comes well not youll have plenty of time for education said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because you realize now that your reform candidate for judge is of dick kelly didnt propose hugo galland cried davy hotly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i something in dorns tone made davy feel that it would be unwise to yield to the impulse to tell a lie for the highly moral purpose of silencing this agitator and demagogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will remember pursued victor that galland was the sixth or seventh name you proposedand that joe house rejected the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did it after consulting with kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you recalldont you?that every time you brought him a name he how do you know so much about all this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried davy his tone suggesting that victor was wholly mistaken but his manner betraying that he knew victor was right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh politicians are human replied dorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the human race is loosemouthed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw years ago that if i was to build my party i must have full and accurate information as to all that galland is an honest manrichabove suspicion above corruptionan ideal candidate said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a corporation owner a corporation lawyer and a fool said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as ive told you all dick kellys interest in galland is my man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to see him elected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if kellys for galland so much the better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then were sure of electing himof im not here to argue with you about politics davy said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i brought you here because i like youbelieve in your honestyand dont want to see you humiliated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im giving you a from what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired hull not so valiant as he pretended to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the ridicule and disgrace that will cover this reform hull burst out laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he you cant irritate me hull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been giving you the benefit of the doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you are falling into the commonest kind of errordoing evil and winking at evil in order that a good end may be gained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are the things you reformers davy maintained a haughty silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the traction scandals the gas scandals and the paving of course said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thenwhy have the gas crowd the traction crowd and the paving crowd each contributed twentyfive thousand dollars to your hull stared at victor dorn in amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butnow that youre facing the situation squarely dont you see that youre being made a fool of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would those people put up for your election if they werent sure you and your crowd were theyll find out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll find out you mean replied victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see your whole programme davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll put you in and theyll say let us alone and well make you governor of the state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annoy us and youll have no political future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youll say to yourself the wise thing for me to do is to wait until im governor before i begin to serve the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i can really do something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so youll be their mayorand afterward their governorbecause theyll hold out another inducement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow by that time youll be so completely theirs that youll have no after reading how some famous oration wrought upon its audience we turn to it and wonder that such tempests of emotion could have been produced by such simple perhaps almost commonplace words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the key to the mystery is usually a magic quality in the tone of the orator evoking before its hypnotized hearers a series of vivid pictures just as the notes of a violin with no aid from words or even from musical form seem to materialize into visions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this uncommon yet by no means rare power was in victor dorns voice and explained his extraordinary influence over people of all kinds and classes it wove a spell that enmeshed even those who disliked him for his detestable views <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy hull listening to victors simple recital of his prospective career was so wrought upon that he sat staring before him in a kind of terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy said victor gently youre at the parting of the ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time for honest halfway reformers for political amateurs has passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speak or and hull knew that it was so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to do whats right whats best for the dont worry about the people hull said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upper classes come and pass but the people remain bigger and stronger and more aggressive with every century <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they dictate language and art and politics and religionwhat we shall all eat and wear and think and do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only what they approve only that yoke even which they themselves accept has any chance of enduring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont worry about the people davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> worry about i admit said hull that i dont like a lot of things about thethe forces i find ive got to use in order to carry through my plans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i admit that even the sincere young fellows ive grouped together to head this movement are narrowsuperciliousselfsatisfied that they irritate me and are not trustworthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i feel that if i once get the office ill be strong enough to put my plans through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nervously im giving you my full confidenceas ive given it to no one youve told me nothing i didnt know already said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got to choose between this reform party and your party continued hull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is ive got no choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for candidly ive no confidence in the working class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its too ignorant to do the ruling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its too credulous to build onfor its credulity makes it fickle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i believe in the better class too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be sordid and greedy and tyrannical but by appealing to its good instinctsand to its fear of the money kings and the if you want to get office said dorn youre right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you want to be somebody if you want to develop yourself to have the joy of being utterly unafraid in speech and in actionwhy after a pause hull said id like to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id like to help victor laid his hand on davys arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get it straight davy he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well make an honest man of youinstead of a trimming politician trying to say or to do something more or less honest once in a while and winking at or abetting crookedness most of ive done nothing and ill do nothing to be ashamed of protested hull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moneys ours now said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he could not meet victors eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor said they paid a hundred thousand dollars for a judgeship and for a blanket mortgage on your party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you should win youd find you could do little showy things that were of no value but nothing that would seriously disturb a single leech sucking the blood of i dont agree with you said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he roused himself into angerhis only remaining refuge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your prejudices blind you to all the meansthe practical meansof doing good dorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive listened patiently to you because i respect your sincerity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im not going to waste my life in mere criticism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to an expression of profound sadness came into victors face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember what ive told you about what well be compelled to do if you launch hull was tempted to burst out violently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was not this swollenheaded upstart trying to intimidate him by threats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his strong instinct for prudence persuaded him to conceal his resentment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the devil should you attack us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely were nearer your kind of thing than the old we purpose to keep the issue clear in this town replied victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we cant allow a party to grow up that pretends to be just as good as ours but is really a cover behind which the that is youll tolerate in this market no brand of honest if you wish to put it that way replied victor coolly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well see that house does win replied victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we have shot your movement full of holes and sunk it house will put and corruption rampant means further and much needed education in the school of hard experience for the voters said dorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the more education the larger our party and the quicker hull laughed angrily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> talk about but dorn held his good humor of the man who has the power and knows it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think it over davy counseled he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll see youve got to come with us or join kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for your own sake id like to see you with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the partys sake youd better be with kelly for youre not really a workingman and our fellows would be uneasy about you for a long time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see weve had experience of rich young men whose hearts beat for the wrongs of before you definitely decide to break with the decent element of the better class victor i want you to think it over said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wei myselfhave befriended you more than once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for a few of us who still have hope that demagoguery will die of victor laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish they would suppress it said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result would give the better element in this town a very bad quarter of an hour at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve both said all weve got to say to each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see ive done no good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feared it would be so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was looking into hulls eyesinto his very soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we meet again you will probably be my open and bitter enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hull looked after him in surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first blush he was astonished that dorn should care so much about him as this curious interview and his emotion at its end indicated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on reflecting his astonishment disappeared and he took the view that dorn was simply impressed by his personality and by his abilitywas perhaps craftily trying to disarm him and to destroy his political movement which was threatening to destroy the workingmens league <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a very shrewd chap is dorn thought davywhy do we always generously concede at least acumen to those we suspect of having a good opinion of us?a very shrewd chap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its unfortunate hes cursed with that miserable envy of those better born and better off than he davy spent the early evening at the university club where he was an important figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later on he went to a dance at mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> venablesand there he was indeed a lion as an unmarried man with money cannot but be in a company of ladiesfor money to a lady is what soil and sun and rain are to a floweris that without which she must cease to exist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still later when he was alone in bedperhaps with the supper he ate at mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> venables not sitting as lightly as comfort requiredthe things victor dorn had said came trailing drearily through his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what kind of an article would dorn print <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those facts about the campaign fund certainly would look badly in cold typeespecially if dorn had the proofs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hugo galland beyond question the mere list of the corporations in which hugo was director or large stockholder would make him absurd as a judge sitting in that district <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hugo the soninlaw of the most offensive capitalist in that section of the state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the deal with house endorsed by kellyhow nasty that would look if victor had the proofs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must have a talk with kelly said davy aloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the words startled himnot his voice suddenly sounding in the profound stillness of his bedroom but the words themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was his first admission to himself of the vicious truth he had known from the outset and had been pretending to himself that he did not knowthe truth that his reform movement was a fraud contrived by dick kelly to further the interests of the company of financiers and the gang of politico criminal thugs who owned the party machinery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a nice question whether a man is ever allowed to go in honest selfdeception decisively far along a wrong road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however this may be certain it is that david hull reformer was not so allowed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he was glad of the darkness that hid him at least physically from himself as he strove to convince himself that if he was doing wrong it was from the highest motives and for the noblest purposes and would result in the public good and not merely in fame and office for david hull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the struggle ended as struggles usually end in the famous arena of moral sham battles called conscience and toward the middle of the following morning davy at peace with himself and prepared to make any sacrifice of personal squeamishness or moral idealism for the sake of the public good sought out dick kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kellys original headquarters had of course been the doggery in and through which he had established himself as a political power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as his power grew and his relations with more respectable elements of society extended he shifted to a saloon and beer garden kept by a reputable german and frequented by all kinds of peoplea place where his friends of the avowedly criminal class and his newer friends of the class that does nothing legally criminal except in emergencies would feel equally at ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he retained ownership of the doggery but took his name down and put up that of his barkeeper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he won his first big political fight and took charge of the public affairs of remsen city and made an arrangement with joe house where under remsen city whenever it wearied or sickened of kelly could take instead kelly disguised as joe house when he thus became a full blown boss he established a secondary headquarters in addition to that at herrmanns garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every morning at ten oclock he took his stand in the main corridor of the city hall really a thoroughfare and short cut for the busiest part of town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a cigar in his mouth he stood there for an hour or so holding court making appointments attending to all sorts of political business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently his importance and his ideas of etiquette expanded to such an extent that he had to establish the blaine club <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joe houses tilden club was established two years later in imitation of kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you had very private and important business with kelly business of the kind of which the public must get no inkling you madepreferably by telephonean appointment to meet him in his real estate offices in the hastings buildinga suite with entrances and exits into three separated corridors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wished to see him about ordinary matters and were a person who could confer with kelly without its causing talk you met him at the blaine club <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wished to cultivate him to pay court to him you saw him at herrmannsor in the general rooms of the club <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you were a busy man and had time only to exchange greetings with himto keep in touchyou passed through the city hall now and then at his hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some bosses soon grow too proud for the vulgar democracy of such a public stand but kelly partly through shrewdness partly through inclination clung to the city hall stand and encouraged the humblest citizens to seek him there and tell him the news or ask his aid or his advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was at the city hall that davy hull sought him and found him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice he walked briskly to the boss the third time he went by slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kelly who saw everything had known from the first glance at hulls grave anxious face that the young leader of the holy boys was there to see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he ignored davy until davy addressed him directly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he observing the young man with eyes i want to have a little talk with you davy blurted out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> couldnt i see you at somesome place where wed not be interrupted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw victor dorn yesterday and he said some i do know about em replied kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as davy paused in an embarrassed search for a word that would not hurt his own but recently soothed conscience kelly laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to upset the nice moral campaign you and joe house have laid out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i know all about mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butjoe house is the man you want to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you boys are trying to do me uptrying to break up the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant expect me to help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got great respect for you personally mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your fatherhe was a fine old republican wheelhorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood by the party through thick and thinand the party stood by him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> politically i respect straight organization men of either party but ive got no use for amateurs and reformers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this in perfect good humor and in a tone of banter that might have ruffled a man with a keener sense of humor than davys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy was red to his eyes not because kelly was laughing at him but because he stood convicted of such a stupid political blunder as coming direct to kelly when obviously he should have gone to kellys secret partner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorn means to attack us allrepublicans democrats and citizens alliance stammered davy trying to justify himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kelly shifted his cigar and shrugged his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont worry about his attacks on meon us said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we havent got no reputation for but he says he can prove that our whole campaign is simply a deal between you and house and me to fool the people and elect a so ive heard said kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know it no i dont mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary i think it is so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i may add i think we are justified in making such a deal when thats the only way to save kelly looked at him silently with amused eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> house cant do anything pursued davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so im glad youre getting a little political sense my boy said kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps youre beginning to see that a politician has got to be practicalthat its the organizations that keeps i see that said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im willing to admit that ive misjudged you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kellythat the better classes owe you a heavy debtand that you are one of the men weve got to rely on chiefly to stem the tide of anarchy thats risingthe attack on i see your eyes are being opened my boy said kelly in a kindly tone that showed how deeply he appreciated this unexpected recognition of his own notion of his mission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you young silk stocking fellows up at the university club and the lincoln and the jefferson have been indulging in a lot of loose talk against the fellows that do the hard work in politicsthe fellows that helped your fathers to make fortunes and that are helping you boys to keep em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i didnt have a pretty level head on me id take my hands off and give dorn and his gang a chance at you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you when you fool with that reform nonsense you play but ii had an idea that you wanted me to go ahead said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the way you started last spring replied kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the way youd a gone if i hadnt taken hold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been saving you in spite of yourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thanks to me your partys on a sound conservative basis and wont do any harm and may do some good in teaching a lesson to those of our boys thatve been going a little too far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it aint good for an organization to win victor dorn seemed to be sureabsolutely sure said hull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont worry about him i tell you replied kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sudden hardening of his voice and of his never notably soft face was tribute stronger than any words to dorns ability as a politician to his power as an antagonist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy felt a sinister intentand he knew that dick kelly had risen because he would stop at nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as eager to get away from the boss as the boss was to be rid of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the intrusion of a henchman to whom kelly had no doubt signaled gave him the excuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as he had turned from the city hall into morton street he slackened to as slow a walk as his length of leg would permit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moving along absorbed in uncomfortable thoughts he startled she was standing before himthe same fascinating embodiment of life and health and untamed energy the direct honest glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to talk to you she went on and i cant walking beside you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come into the park and well he had mechanically lifted his hat but he had not spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not find words until they were seated side by side and then in fact he was the reverse of glad for he was afraid of her afraid of himself when under the spell of her presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he who prided himself on his selfcontrol he could not account for the effect this girl had upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he sat there beside her the impulse jane hastings had so adroitly checked came surging back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had believed had hoped it was gone for good and all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found that in its mysterious hiding place it had been gaining strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite clearly he saw how absurd was the idea of making this girl his wifehe tall and she not much above the bend of his elbow he conventional and she the incarnation of passionate revolt against the restraints of class and form and custom which he not only conformed to but religiously believed in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she set stirring in him all kinds of vague wild longings to run amuck socially and politicallylongings that if indulged would ruin him for any career worthy of the name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must goi really must he said confusedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laid her small strong hand on his arma natural friendly gesture with her and giving no suggestion of familiarity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even as she was saying pleaseonly a moment he dropped back to the seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said abruptly his gaze resolutely away from her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor was telling me this morning about his talk with you she said in her rapid energetic way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was depressed because he had failed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i felt sure i feel surethat he hasnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in our talk the other day mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hull i got a clear idea of your character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i know that after victor told you the plain truth about the situation you couldnt david looked round rather wildly swallowed hard several times but for a slight change of expression or of color davy would have thought she had not heardor perhaps that he had imagined he was uttering the words that forced themselves to his lips in spite of his efforts to suppress them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for she went on in the same it seemed to me that you have an instinct for the right thats unusual in men of your class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least i think its unusual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i confess ive not known any man of your class except youand i know you very slightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was i that persuaded victor to go to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he believes that a mans class feeling controls him makes his moral sensecompels his actions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i thought you were an i dont know what i am said hull gloomily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i want to do right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not theoretical right but the thats true conceded selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant always be certain whats right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but cant we always know whats wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hull it is wrongaltogether wrongand you know its wrongto lend your name and your influence and your reputation to that crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd let you do a little goodwhy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make their professions of reform seem plausible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to fool the people into trusting them again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and under cover of the little good you were showily doing how much mischief theyd do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youll go back over the history of this townof any townof any countryyoull find that most of the wicked thingsthe things that pile the burdens on the shoulders of the poorthe masses most of the wicked things have been done under cover of just such but i want to build up a new partya party of honest men honestly led said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> led by your sort of young men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean young men of your class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> led by young lawyers and merchants and young fellows living on inherited incomes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you see thats impossible cried selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are all living off the labor of others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their whole idea of life is exploiting the massesis reaping where they have not sown or reaping not only what theyve sown but also what others have sownfor they couldnt buy luxury and all the socalled refinements of life for themselves and their idle families merely with what they themselves could earn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can you build up a really honest party with such men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they no doubt are honest up to a certain point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they will side with their class in every crisis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and their class is i dont agree with you said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not fair to how <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt argue with you replied hull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all ill say is that youve seen only the one sideonly the side of the working that toils without ceasingits men its women its children said the girl with heaving bosom and flashing eyesonly to have most of what it earns filched away from it and whose fault is that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fault of my class replied she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their ignorance their stupidityyes and their foolish cunning that overreaches itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for they tolerate the abuses of the present system because each manat least each man of the ones who think themselves smartimagines that the day is coming when he can escape from the working class and gain the ranks of the and you ask me to come into the party of those people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hull said sheand until then he had not appreciated how lovely her voice was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesthat is the party for youfor all honest sincere men who want to have their own respect through and through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to teach those peopleto lead them rightto be truthful and just with themthat is the life worth but they wont learn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are as ungrateful as they are foolish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they werent men like me trying to make a decent career wouldnt have to compromise with the kellys and the houses and their masters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are kelly and house but leaders of your class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they lead ten to victor dorns one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why any day dorns followers may turn on himand and what of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes not working to be their leader but to do what he thinks is right regardless of consequences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why is he a happy man as happiness goes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why has he gone on his way steadily all these years never minding setbacks and failures and defeats and dangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i neednt tell no said hull powerfully moved by her earnestness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i the finest sentence that ever fell from human lips selma went on was father forgive them they know not what they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forgive themforgive us all for when we go astray it is because we are in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i want you to come with us mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hull and help to make it a little less dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least you will then be looking toward the lightand every one turned in that yes said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane hastings had that same curiosity said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill answer you as i answered herthough she didnt ask me quite so directly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i am not in love with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are too busy to bother about those things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we thenthere is no reason why i should not ask you to be my she looked at him with a peculiar smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes there is a very good reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not love you and i shall not love you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i i dont believe in much else said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butnot the kind how do you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not told you yet how i oh yes you have interrupted she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the secondno the third time you have seen me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the love you offer me can only be of a kind it is not in the least flattering to a woman to inspire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you neednt apologize she went on laughingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive no doubt you mean well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you simply dont its you that dont understand selma cried he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont realize how wonderful you arehow much you reveal of yourself at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was all but engaged to another woman when i saw you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been fighting against my love for youfighting against the truth that suddenly came to me that you were the only woman i had ever seen who appealed to and aroused and made strong all that is brave and honest in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am clearer headed than i ever was in my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was regarding him with a friendly and even tender sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it was simply the ordinary outburst of passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i see that it was the result of your struggle with yourself about which road to take in making if she had not been absorbed in developing her theory she might have seen that davy was not altogether satisfied with this analysis of his feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he deemed it wise to hold his peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do need some onesome woman she went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i am anxious to help you all i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt help you by marrying you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to me marriage means she checked herself abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can help you i think as a friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you wish to marry you should take some one in your own class some one whos in sympathy with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you and she could work it out togethercould help each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i dont need youand theres nothing in one sided marriages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no you i believe thats true said davy miserably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reflected then continued but theres jane hastings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is having the same sort of struggle with herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and she could help each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youre both of you fine characters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like each of you for exactly the same reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesjane needs you and you need her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with her sweet frank smile like a breeze straight from the sweep of a vast plateau <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why its so obvious that i wonder you and she havent become engaged long ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are fond she shook her head with a quaint fascinating expression of positiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now my friend said she drop that fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it threatens to become silly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her smile suddenly expanded into a laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of you and me marriedof me married to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i shouldnt stay long enough for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id be of on the wings of the wind to the other end of the earth as soon as you tried to he did not join in her laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will think again before you go in with those peoplewont you david <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to see you the man you can thenmarry me he cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes looked gentle friendship her passionate lips curled in scorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might marry the sort of man you could be she said but i never could marry a man so weak that without me to and she turned and walked away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few days later after she had taken her daily two hours walk selma went into the secluded part of washington park and spent the rest of the morning writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her walk was her habitual time for thinking out her plans for the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when it was writing that she had to do and the weather was fine that particular hillside with its splendid shade so restful for the eyes and so stimulating to the mind became her workshop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought that she was helped as much by the colors of grass and foliage as by the softened light and the tranquil view out over hills and valleys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had finished her article she consulted the little nickel watch she carried in her bag and discovered that it was only one oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had counted on getting through at three or half past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could she best use them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the part of the park where she was sitting was separated from the hastings grounds only by the winding highroad making its last reach for the top of the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she decided that she would go to see jane hastingswould try to make tactful progress in her project of helping jane and david hull by marrying them to each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once she had hit upon this project her interest in both of them had equally increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes these gained two hours was an opportunity not to be neglected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put her papers into her shopping bag and went straight up the steep hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she arrived at the top at the edge of the lawn before janes house with somewhat heightened color and brightened eyes but with no quickening of the breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her slim solid little body had all the qualities of endurance of those wiry ponies that come from the regions her face and walk and the careless grace of her hair so delightfully suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she advanced toward the house she saw a gay company assembled on the wide veranda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane was giving a farewell luncheon for her visitors had asked almost a dozen of the most presentable girls in the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a very fashionable affair and everyone had dressed for it in the best she had to wear at that time of day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma saw the company while there was still time for her to draw back and descend into the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she knew little about conventionalities and she cared not at all about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had come to see jane she conducted herself precisely as she would have expected any one to act who came to see her at any time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she marched straight across the lawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hostess the fashionable visitors the fashionable guests soon centered upon the extraordinary figure moving toward them under that blazing sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the figure was extraordinary not for dressthe dress was plain and unconspicuousbut for that expression of the free and the untamed the lack of selfconsciousness so rarely seen except in children and animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane rushed to the steps to welcome her seized her extended hands and kissed her with as much enthusiasm as she kissed jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was sincerity in this greeting of janes but there was pose also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was one of those chances to do the unconventional the democratic thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll stop for lunch of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then to the girls nearest them this is pronouncing of namessmilesbowsveiled glances of curiosityseveral young women exchanging whispered comments of amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to be sure selma in that simple costume gloveless with dusty shoes and blown hair did look very much out of place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then selma would have looked in a sense out of place anywhere but in a wilderness with perhaps a few tents and a halftamed herd as background <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in another sense she seemed in place anywhere as any natural object must <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont eat lunch said selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ill stay if youll put she did not realize what an upsetting of order and precedence this request which seemed so simple to her involved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane hesitated but only for a fraction of a second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that ive got you id not let you selma was gazing around at the other girls with the frank and pleased curiosity of a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she criedshe was addressing miss clearwater of cincinnati <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive read about this sort of thing in novels and in society columns of newspapers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i never saw it before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isnt it miss clearwater whose father was a united states senatorby purchasehad had experience of many oddities male and female <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she also was attracted by selmas sparkling delight and by the magnetic charm which she irradiated as a rose its perfume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pretty clothes are attractive arent they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said she to be saying something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know a thing about clothes confessed selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never owned at the same time more than two dresses fit to wearusually only one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id only be fretted by a lot of things of that kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i like to see them on other people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had my way the whole world would be well except you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said ellen clearwater with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt be well dressed if i tried replied selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i was a child i was the despair of my mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the people in the tenement where we lived were very dirty and disorderlynaturally enough as they had no knowledge and no money and no time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mother had ideas of neatness and cleanliness and she used to try to keep me looking decent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was of no use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten minutes after she had smoothed me down i you were brought up in a tenement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several of the girls within hearing were blushing for selma and were feeling how distressed jane hastings must be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a wonderfully happy childhood replied selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until i was old enough to understand and to suffer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive lived in tenements all my lifeamong very poor people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id not feel at when i was born said miss clearwater we lived in a log selma showed the astonishment the other girls were feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while their astonishment was in part at a girl of ellen clearwaters position making such a degrading confession hers had none of that element in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont in the least suggest a log cabin or poverty of any kind said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i supposed you no indeed replied ellen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gazed calmly round at the other girls who were listening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i doubt if any of us here was born to what you see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course we some of usmake pretensesall sorts of silly pretenses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as a matter of fact there isnt one of us who hasnt near relatives in the cabins or there was a hasty turning away from this dangerous conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane came back from ordering the rearrangement of her luncheon you take her up ellen said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well be in selmas eyes were wide and roving as she and ellen went through the drawingroom the hall up stairs and into the very prettily furnished suite which ellen was occupying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw anything like this before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the first time i was ever in a grand house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a grand house isnt noits only comfortable replied ellen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how beautiful everything isand how convenient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent felt this way since the first time i went to the circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she pointed to a rack from which were suspended thin silk dressing gowns of various rather gay patterns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just to wear round while one selma advanced and felt and examined them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to suit i suspect you of a secret fondness for luxury said ellen slyly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would i do with such things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why id have no time to wear them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id never dare she roamed through dressingroom bedroom bath room marveling inquiring admiring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im so glad i came said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this will give me a fresh point of view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can understand the people of your class better and be more tolerant about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understand now why they are so hard and so indifferent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre quite removed from the common lot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how narrow it must make one to have ones life filled with these pretty little things for luxury and show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why if i ellen was silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt mean to say anything rude or offensive said selma sensitive to the faintest impressions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was speaking my the young reformer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said ellen with a queer little smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a depressed expression settled upon her features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were keeping as selma was making a few passes at her rebellious thick hairpasses the like of which miss clearwater had never before ive been somewhat interested in david hull of latehave been hoping he could graduate from a fake reformer into a useful citizen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she looked round expressively at the luxury surrounding them one might as well try to grow wheat in davy is a fine fraud said ellen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finebecause he doesnt im afraid he is a fraud said selma setting on her hat again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might have been a man if hed been brought up properly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gazed at ellen with sad shining eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many men and women luxury blights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it certainly has done for davy said ellen lightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell why do you think so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father is a public man miss clearwater explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ive seen a great deal of these reformers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre the ordinary human variety of politician plus a more or less conscious hypocrisy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> usually theyre men who fancy themselves superior to the common run in birth and breeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father has taught me to they went down and selma seated between jane and miss clearwater amused both with her frank comments on the scene so strange to herthe beautiful table the costly service the variety and profusion of elaborate food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact jane reaching out after the effects got easily in europe and almost as easily in the east but overtaxed the resources of the household which she was only beginning to get into what she regarded as satisfactory order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the luncheon therefore was a creditable and promising attempt rather than a success from the standpoint of fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane was a little ashamed and at times extremely nervous this when she saw signs of her staff falling into disorder that might end in rout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but selma saw none of the defects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was delighted with the dazzling spectaclefor two or three courses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she lapsed into quiet and could not be roused to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane and ellen thought she was overwhelmed and had been seized of shyness in this company so superior to any in which she had ever found herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ellen tried to induce her to eat and failing decided that her refraining was not so much firmness in the two mealsaday system as fear of making a break <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt genuinely sorry for the silent girl growing moment by moment more illatease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the luncheon was about half over selma said another time said selma pushing back her chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and up she darted smiling gayly round at the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont anybody disturb herself she pleaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she was as good as her word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before any one quite realized what she was about she had escaped from the diningroom and from the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she almost ran across the lawn and into the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there she drew a long breath noisily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried flinging out her arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ohbut it was miss hastings and miss clearwater had not been so penetrating as they fancied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> embarrassment had nothing to do with the silence that had taken possession of the associate editor of the new day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was never selfconscious enough to be really shy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hastened to the office meeting victor dorn in the street what now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was used to that phrase from the ardent and impressionable selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for her with her wideopen eyes and ears her vivid imagination and her thirsty mind life was one closely packed series of adventures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had an hour to spare she proceeded to explain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it was a chance to further a little scheme ive got for um <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said victor with a quick change of expression which however selma happened not to observe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she went on i blundered into a luncheon party jane was giving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you never sawyou never dreamed of such stylesuch dresses and dishes and flowers and hats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i was sitting there with them enjoying it all as if it were a circus or a ballet when oh victor what a silly what a pitiful waste of time and money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so much to do in the worldso much that is thrillingly interesting and usefuland those intelligent young people dawdling there at nonsense a child would weary of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had stayed another minute i should have burst out crying or denouncing themor pleading with them to behave what else can they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont know any and he led the way up to the editorial room and held her to the subject of the article he had asked her to write <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the first opportunity she went back to the subject uppermost in her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres no hope for any people of that class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the busy ones are thinking only of making money for themselves and the idle ones are too enfeebled by luxury to think at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no im afraid theres no hope for hullor for im not sure about miss hastings said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would have been if youd seen her today replied selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh she was lovely victorreally wonderful to look at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and body and soul she belongs to the upper class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she understands charity but she doesnt understand justice and never could understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall let her alone how harsh you women are in your judgments of each other laughed dorn busy at his desk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are not fooled by each dorn apparently had not heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma saw that to speak would be to interrupt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat at her own table and set to work on the editorial paragraphs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after perhaps an hour she happened to glance at victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was leaning back in his chair gazing past her out into the open in his face was an expression she had never seena look in the eyes a relaxing of the muscles round the mouth that made her think of him as a man instead of as a leader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a fascinating man he she felt that he was not thinking of his work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she longed to talk to him but she did not venture to interrupt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never in all the years she had known him had he spoken to heror to any onea severe or even an impatient word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tolerance his good humor were infinite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yetshe and all who came into contact with him were afraid of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there could come and on occasion there did comeinto those extraordinary blue eyes an expression beside which the fiercest flash of wrath would be easy to face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she glanced at him again his normal expression had returnedthe face of the leader who aroused in those he converted into fellowworkers a fanatical devotion that was the more formidable because it was not infatuated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he caught her eye things are in such good shape for us that it frightens me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spend most of my time in studying the horizon in the hope that i can foresee which way the storms coming from and what it will what a pessimist you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why the workingmens league has a thick andthin membership of thirteen hundred and fifty replied victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why the new day has twenty two hundred paying subscribers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why we grow faster than the employers can weed our men out and replace them with immigrants and force them well anyhow said the girl no matter what happens we victor shook his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our danger period has just begun he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the past weve been annoyed a little from time to time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they thought us hardly i hope they will prosecute us said selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then well not if they do it intelligently replied victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an intelligent persecutionif its relentless enough always succeeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you forget that this isnt a world of moral ideas but of force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid of dick kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is something more than a vulgar boss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my hope is that he wont be able to make the others see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw him a while ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was extremely polite to memore so than he ever has been before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is up to victor paused reflecting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suspect that he thinks he has us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rose preparing to go out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we shall have to begin how stupid they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to fight us who are simply trying to bring about peaceably and sensibly whats yesthe rain is bound to come said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we say heres an umbrella and theres the way to shelter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they laugh at our umbrella and with the first drops plashing on their the workingmens league always first in the field with its ticket had been unusually early that year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although it was only the first week in august and the election would not be until the third of october the league had nominated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a ticket made up entirely of skilled workers who had lived all their lives in remsen city and who had acquired an independence victor dorn was careful not to expose to the falling fire of the opposition any of his men who could be ruined by the loss of a job or could be compelled to leave town in search of work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the league always went early into campaign because it pursued a much slower and less expensive method of electioneering than either of the old partiesor than any of the upper class reform parties that sprang up from time to time and died away as they accomplished or failed of their purposesecuring recognition for certain personal ambitions not agreeable to the old established bosses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides the league was like the bosses and their henchmen in politics every day in every year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the league theory was that politics was as much a part of a citizens daily routine as his other work or his meals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the night of the leagues great ratification meeting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day the first campaign number containing the biographical sketch of tony rivers kellys righthand man  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would go upon the press and on the following day it would reach the public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> market square in remsen city was on the edge of the power quarter was surrounded by cheap hotels boarding houses and saloons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few years before the most notable citizens market basket on arm could have been seen three mornings in the week making the rounds of the stalls and stands both those in the open and those within the market house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but customs had rapidly changed in remsen city and with the exception of a few old fogies only the poorer classes went to market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the masters of houses were becoming gentlemen and the housewives were elevating into ladiesand it goes without saying that no gentleman and no lady would descend to a menial task even in private much less in public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> market square had even become too common for any but the inferior meetings of the two leading political parties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the workingmens league held to the old tradition that a political meeting of the first rank could be properly held nowhere but in the natural assembling place of the peopletheir market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so their first great rally of the campaign was billed for market square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at eight oclock headed by a large and vigorous drum corps the victor dorn cohorts at their full strength marched into the centre of the square where one of the stands had been transformed with flags bunting and torches into a speakers platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a crowd of many thousands accompanied and followed the procession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> workingmens league meetings were popular even among those who believed their interests lay elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at league meetings one heard the plain truth sometimes extremely startling plain truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the league had no favors to ask of anybody had nothing to conceal was strongly opposed to any and all political concealments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus its speakers enjoyed a freedom not usual in political speakingand dorn and his fellowleaders were careful that no router no exaggerator or well intentioned wild man of any kind should open his mouth under a league banner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was what made the league so dangerousand so steadily prosperous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chairman thomas colman the cooper was opening the meeting in a speech which was an instance of how well a man of no platform talent can acquit himself when he believes something and believes it is his duty to convey it to his fellowmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor dorn to be the fourth speaker and the orator of the evening was standing at the rear of the platform partially concealed by the crowd of men and women leaders of the party grouped behind colman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as always at the big formal demonstrations of the league victor was watching every move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this evening his anxiety was deeper than ever before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his trained political sagacity warned him that as he had suggested to selma the time of his partys first great crisis was at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no movement could become formidable with out a life and death struggle when its aim frankly was to snatch power from the dominant class and to place it where that class could not hope to prevail either by direct means of force or by its favorite indirect means of bribery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would be his stroke at the very life of the league <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for victor had measured kelly and knew he was not one to strike until he could destroy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like every competent man of action victor had measured his own abilities and had found that they were to be relied upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the contest between him and kelly the contest in the last ditchwas so appallingly unequal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kelly had the courts and the police the moneyed class the employers of labor had the clergy and welldressed respectability the newspapers all the customary arbiters of public sentiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he had the criminal and the semicriminal classes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the letter of the law guaranteeing freedom of innocent speech and action guaranteeing the purity of the ballotno not guaranteeing but simply asserting those rights and leaving the upholding of them tokellys allies and henchmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also the league had the power of between a thousand and fifteen hundred intelligent and devoted men and about the same number of womena solid phalanx of great might of might far beyond its numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had no mean opinion of his value to the movement but he far and most modestly underestimated it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the human way of rallying to an abstract principle is by way of a standard bearera man personalitya real or fancied incarnation of the ideal to be struggled for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to the workingmens league to the movement for conquering remsen city for the mass of its citizens victor dorn was that incarnation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kelly could use violenceviolence disguised as law violence candidly and brutally lawless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor dorn could only use lawful meansclearly and cautiously lawful means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must at all costs prevent the use of force against him and his partymust give kelly no pretext for using the law lawlessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if kelly used force against him whether the perverted law of the courts or open lawlessness he must meet it with peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if kelly smote him on the right cheek he must give him the left to be smitten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the league could outvote kelly thenanother policy still of calmness and peace and civilization but not so meek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but until the league could outvote kelly nothing but patient endurance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every man in the league had been drilled in this strategy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every man understoodand to be a member of the league meant that one was politically educated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor believed in his associates as he believed in himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still human nature was human nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if kelly should suddenly offer some adroit outrageous provocation would the league be able to resist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor on guard studied the crowd spreading out from the platform in a gigantic fan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing there to arouse suspicion ten or twelve thousand of working class men and women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his glance pushed on out toward the edges of the crowdtoward the saloons and alleys of the disreputable south side of market square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his glance traveled slowly along pausing upon each place where these loungers too far away to hear were gathered into larger groups <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why he did not know but suddenly his glance wheeled to the right and then as suddenly to the leftthe west and the east ends of the square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there on either side he recognized in the farthest rim of the crowd several of the men who did kellys lowest kinds of dirty workthe brawlers the repeaters the leaders of gangs the false witnesses for petty corporation damage cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a second glance and he saw or perhaps divinedpurpose in those sinister presences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked for the policethe detail of a dozen bluecoats always assigned to large openair meetings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a policeman was to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor pushed through the crowd on the platform advanced to the side of colman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just a minute tom he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got to colman had fallen back victor dorn was facing the crowdhis crowdthe men and women who loved him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the clear friendly natural voice that marked him for the leader born the honest my friends if there is an attempt to disturb this meeting remember what we of the league stand for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> draw away from every disturber and wait for the police to act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the police stop our meeting let themand be ready to go to court and testify to the exact words of the speaker on which the meeting was stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember we must be more lawful than the he was turning away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cheer was risinga belated cheer because his words had set them all to thinking and to observing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the left of the crowd a dozen yards away from the platform came a stone heavily rather than swiftly flung as from an impeded hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in full view of all it curved across the front of the platform and struck victor dorn full in the side of the head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shouted with a terrible energy then he staggered forward and fell from the platform into the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it flew into the crowd from every direction the beech hollow gangs tore their way yelling and cursing and striking out right and left trampling children knocking down women pouring out the foulest insults <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the street lamps all round market square went out the torches on the platform were torn down and extinguished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in a dimness almost pitch dark a riot that involved that whole mass of people raged hideously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yells and screams and groans the shrieks of women the piteous appeals of childrenbenches torn up for weaponsmad slashing aboutsnarls and singings of painstricken groups then police whistles revolvers fired in the air and the quick regular tramp of disciplined forces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the police strangely ready strangely inactive until the mischief had all been done entered the square from the north and forming a double line across it from east to west swept it slowly clean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fighting ended as abruptly as it had begun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twenty minutes after the flight of that stone the square was empty save a group of perhaps fifty men and women formed about victor dorns body in the shelter of the platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma gordon was holding his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane hastings and ellen clearwater were kneeling beside him and jane was wiping his face with a handkerchief wet with whisky from the flask of the man who had escorted them there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is only stunned said selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can feel the beat of his a doctor came got down on his knees made a rapid examination with expert hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he felt one of the relighted torches suddenly lit up victors face and the faces of those bending over him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is only stunned doctor said selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think so replied the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we left our carriage in the side street just over there said nohome said selma who was calm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must be taken the hospital is the place for him said the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she glanced at the men standing please selma whispered jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let him be taken to the among our enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said selma with a strange and terrible little laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after this we trust no one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they may have arranged to finish this nights work there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he goes thats right miss gordon replied one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres where i drop the case said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing of the kind cried jane imperiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am jane hastingsmartin hastings daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will come with us pleaseor i shall see to it that you are not let off easily for let him go jane said selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there will be a doctor they laid him on a bench top softened with the coats of his followers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the carriage standing in farwell street they laid him across the two seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom colman climbed to the box beside the coachman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane and miss clearwater their escorts and about a score of the leaguers followed on foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the little procession turned into warner street it was stopped by a policeman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant go down this way he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> streets closed said the policeman gruffly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> house across the street burningand probably his house too cut in the policeman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but jane faced the policeman explained who she was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he became humbly civil at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive just told her maam said he that his house is burning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mobs gutting the new day my house is in the next street said colman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of you people get dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus within five minutes victor was lying upon a couch in the parlor of colmans cottage and within ten minutes dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charlton was beside him and was at work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the othersa steadily increasing crowdwere on the steps outside in the front yard were filling the narrow street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colman had organized fifty leaguers into a guard to be ready for any emergencies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the tops of the low houses could be seen the vast cloud of smoke from the fire the air was heavy with the odors of burning wood faintly came sounds of engines of jubilant drunken shouts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fracture of the skull and of the jawbone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man unconscious ghastly pale with his thick hair mussed about his brow and on the right side clotted with blood lay breathing heavily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ellen clearwater came in and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colman whispered to her the doctors cheering statement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went to jane seemed not to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was regarding the face of the young man on the couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were intruding on these people she selma did not hear but she saw and understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesyoud better go jane she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colman and i jane did not heed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she advanced a step nearer the couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said and her voice sounded unnatural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes miss he glanced at her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell be out in less than ten days as good as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a very jane glanced round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish to send for id be glad to see him said dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i assure we dont want dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go home jane i shall go bring dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma took her by the arm and compelled her into the hall and closed the door into the room where victor lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must go home jane she said quietly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know what to do with our victor must have the best said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and selma looked at each other and selma understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has the best said she gentle with an effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alban is the best said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is no place for jane looking and acting like one in a trance tried to push past her and reenter the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said if you do not go i shall have these men take you to your jane looked at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seized her by the arm and beckoning one of the waiting leaguers to her assistance she pushed her quietly but relentlessly along the hall out of the house out of the yard and into the carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she closed the door while jane sank back against the cushions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he belongs to you said jane but i love him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh selma suddenly burst into tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least ill wait here untiluntil they are sure said but they are sure said selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must go with your when ellen clearwater and joe wetherbethe second son of the chief owner of the first national reached the curb selma said when wetherbe had withdrawn she said miss hastings isnot jane leaned from the open carriage window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ellen said she i am going to stay here until victor recovers consciousness he has just come around said ellen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is certain to get i must see for myself cried jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma was preventing her leaving the carriage when ellen quietly interfered with a significant look for selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane she said you cant go in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor has just put every one out jane hesitated drew back into the corner of the carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wetherbe to go his own way said ellen aside to selma and she got in beside jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hastings said selma to the driver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave ellens message to wetherbe and returned to the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor was still unconscious he did not come to himself until toward daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then it was clear to them all that dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> public opinion in remsen city was publicly articulate by means of three daily newspapersthe pioneer the star and the free press <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the star and the free press were owned by the same group of capitalists who controlled the gas company and the water works <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pioneer was owned by the traction interests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both groups of capitalists were jointly interested in the railways the banks and in the principal factories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pioneer was republican was regarded as the organ of dick kelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the star was democratic spoke less cordially of kelly and always called for house mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the free press posed as independent with democratic leanings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it indulged in admirable essays against corruption gang rule and bossism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was never specific and during campaigns was meek and mild <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for nearly a dozen years there had not been a word of truth upon any subject important to the people of remsen city in the columns of any of the three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during wars between rival groups of capitalists a halftruth was now and then timidly uttered but never a word of loose talk of anarchy of anything but thus any one who might have witnessed the scenes in market square on thursday evening would have been not a little astonished to read the accounts presented the next day by the three newspapers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to all three the workingmens league long a menace to the public peace had at last brought upon remsen city the shame of a riot in which two men a woman and four children had lost their lives and more than a hundred including the notorious victor dorn had been injured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after the riot the part of the mob that was hostile to the dorn gang had swept down upon the office of the new day had wrecked it and had set fire to the building with the result that five houses were burned before the flames could be put out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the free press published as a mere rumor that the immediate cause of the outbreak had been an impending scurrilous attack in the new day upon one of the political gangs of the slums and its leader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the associated press sending forth an account of the riot to the entire country represented it as a fight between rival gangs of workmen precipitated by the insults and menaces of a socialistic party led by a young operator named dorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorns faction had aroused in the mass of the workingmen a fear that this spread of socialistic and anarchistic ideas would cause a general shut down of factories and a flight of the a version of the causes and the events somewhat nearer the truth was talked about remsen city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but all the respectable classes were well content with what their newspapers printed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and while some broad minded respectabilities spoke of the affair as an outrage none of them was disposed to think that any real wrong had been done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor dorn and his crowd of revolutionists had got after all only their deserts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after fortyeight hours of careful study of public opinion dick kelly decided that remsen city was taking the dose as he had anticipated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt emboldened to proceed to his final move in the campaign against anarchy in his beloved city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the second morning after the riot all three newspapers published double headed editorials calling upon the authorities to safeguard the community against another such degrading and dangerous upheaval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is time that the distinction between liberty and license be sharply drawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after editorials in this vein had been repeated for several days after sundry bodies of eminently respectable citizensthe merchants association the taxpayers league the chamber of commercehad passed indignant and appealing resolutions after two priests a clergyman and four preachers had sermonized against the leniency of constituted authority with criminal anarchy mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kelly had the city attorney go before judge lansing and ask for an injunction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge lansing promptly granted the injunction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the new day was enjoined from appearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the workingmens league was enjoined from holding meetings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the county prosecutor also a henchman of kellys secured from the grand jurycomposed of farmers merchants and owners of factoriesindictments against thomas colman and victor dorn for inciting a riot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile victor dorn was rapidly recovering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charlton did not fuss and fret and meddle did not hamper nature with his blundering efforts to assist did not stuff nourishment into his patient to decay and to produce poisonous blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he let the young mans superb vitality work the inevitable and speedy cure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus wounds and shocks that have often been mistreated by doctors into mortal passed so quickly that only selma gordon and the doctor himself realized how grave victors case had been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day he was indictedjust a week from the riothe was sitting up and was talking freely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wont it set him back if i tell him all that has occurred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> talk to him as you would to me replied charlton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive already told him pretty much everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has kept him from fretting to be able to lie there quietly and had you looked in upon victor and selma in colmans little transformed parlor you would rather have thought selma the invalid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man in the bed was pale and thin of face but his eyes had the expression of health and of hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma had great circles under her eyes and her expression was despair struggling to conceal itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those indictments those injunctions how powerful the enemy were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could such an enemy aroused new and inflexibly resolved be combatted?especially when one had no money no way of reaching the people no chance to organize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do you look so it isnt easy to be cheerful with you ill and the paper destroyed replied she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im not ill and the paper isnt destroyed said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never were either i or it doing such good work as now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what more could one ask than to have such selma did not lift her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to her those enemies seemed anything but stupid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had they not ruined the league <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see you dont understand pursued victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but said selma exactly what you said you were afraid of i told you i was afraid dick kelly would make the one move that but he has <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill not tell you said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id not venture to say aloud such a dangerous thing as what id have done if i had been in his place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of doing that he made us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall win selma lifted her head with a sudden gesture of hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had unbounded confidence in victor dorn and his tone was the tone of absolute confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had calculated on winning in five years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had left the then you see how you can hold meetings and start up the i dont want to do either said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want those injunctions to stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those fools have done at a stroke what we couldnt have done in years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have united the working class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theythe fewhave forbidden us the many to unite or to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if those injunctions hold for a month nothing could stop our winning this fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant understand how dick kelly could be so stupid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five years ago these moves of his would have been bad for usyes even three years ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but weve got too strongand he doesnt realize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma when you want to win i still dont understand said selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall be out a week from today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall not go into the streets until i not only am well they arrested tom colman today said selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they put thats right said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are playing into our hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he laughed as heartily as his bandages would permit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i dont understandi dont understand at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried i was never more certain in my life replied victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop worrying about it my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he patted her hands gently as they lay folded in her lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want youall our peopleto go round looking sad these next few days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want dick kelly to feel there came a knock at the door and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been a school teacher and of all the occupations there is no other that leaves such plain such indelible traces upon manner miss jane hastings is outside in her carriageand wants to selma frowned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait until i can get out of the way she cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit down and sit still commanded victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma continued to move toward the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> noi dont wish to see her she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor chagrined her by acquiescing without another word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you want me said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when selma was standing by the bed he took her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma he said dont let these things upset you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma had the look of a wild creature detained against its will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not worried about the partyand the paper she burst selma drew her hand away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be back about half past seven she said and bolted from the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victors goodnatured merry smile followed her to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the sound of her retreat by way of the rear of the house was nowbring in the young lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and please warn her that she must stay at most only half an hour by that clock over there on every day jane had been coming to inquire had been bringing or sending flowers and fruitwhich by dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charltons orders were not supposed to enter the invalids presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> latterly she had been asking to see victor she was surprised when mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will see a clock on the mantel in his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must not stay longer than half an i shall be very careful what i say said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh you neednt bother said the exschool teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charlton doesnt believe in sickroom atmosphere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorn exactly as you would a well person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youre going to ill do my best said jane rather haughtily for she did not like mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was used to being treated with deference especially by the women of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colmans class and while she disapproved of deference in theory in practice she craved it and expected it and was irritated if she did not get it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as she realized how unattractive this weakness was she usually took perhaps more pains than does the average person to conceal it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that day her nerves were too tense for petty precautions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colman was too busy inspecting the details of miss hastings toilet to note miss hastings manners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> janes nervousness vanished the instant she was in the doorway of the parlor with victor dorn looking at her in that splendidly simple and natural way of his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so glad to see you he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a delightful perfume you bring with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know it isnt flowers but it smells like flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with most perfumes you can smell through the perfume to something they were shaking hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said that nice woman who let me in cautioned me not to put on a sick room manner or indulge in sickroom talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just weak enough to like being waited on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were very good to me the night that stone knocked me over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to thank you but i dont know how <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the flowers and the i could do very little said jane blushing and faltering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorn i heard and saw it all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the lying newspapersand all the people i meet socially <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they keep victor was smiling gayly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fortunes of war said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they fought fair they couldnt fight at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we on this side of the struggle can afford to be generous and tolerant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are fighting the losing battle theyre trying to hold on to the past and of course its slipping from them inch by inch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but wewe are in step with the march of when she was with him jane felt that his cause was hers alsowas the only cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when do you begin publishing your not for a month or so replied he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not until after the oh i forgot about that injunction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think that as soon as he hesitated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after the her eyes flashed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard the newsboys crying it and stopped and bought a paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i shall do something about that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going straight from here to father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ellen clearwater and i and joe wetherbe saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ellen and i will testify if its necessaryand will make joe tell the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know he actually had the impudence to try to persuade ellen and me the next day that we saw what the papers i believe it said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i believe that joe convinced you are too charitable replied jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes afraid of his miss hastings said victor you suggested a moment ago that you would influence your father to interfere in this matter of ill promise you now that he will have it stopped said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> janes eyes shifted a little color came into her cheeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if your father talks of helping me you will discourage him all you are saying that out of consideration for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre afraid i hadnt thought of that said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell you what i have in mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ill have to say this muchthat if you did anything to hinder those fellows from carrying out their plans against me and against the league to the uttermost youd be but they may send you to jail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can victors eyes had a quizzical expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but even if i dont give bail miss hastings even if i am sent to jailcolman and istill you must not interfere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant promise she finally said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll make a mess of my plans if i mean that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you would only do they looked at each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said jane i promise on one that if you should change your mind and should want my help i agree to that said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now lets get it clearly in mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no matter what is done about me or the league you promise again jane hesitated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no matter what they do insisted he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something in his expression gave her a great thrill of confidence in him of enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know a moments silence then she exclaimed that was why you let that was one of the reasons confessed he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact it was the chief reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres nothing im so afraid of as of enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to be still more cautious and exact another promise from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must not tell any one i can easily promise that said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a promise easily made is a i begin to understand said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you want them to attack you as savagely as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you dont want them to get the a good guess admitted victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> circumstances have let you farther into my confidence than any you can rely upon me said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want your friendship and your respect as i never wanted anything in my life before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not afraid to say these things to you for i know ill not be victors smile thrilled her again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were born one of us yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do want to be somebody replied the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant content myself in a life of silly routine  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant do things that have no purpose no result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if it wasnt for my father id come out openly for the things i believe in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ive got to think of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be a weakness but i couldnt overcome it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as my father lives ill do nothing that would grieve him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont despise anybody for anything said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in your place i should put my father first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in your place id probably be a davy hull or worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i try never to forget that i owe everything to the circumstances in which i was born and brought up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive simply got the ideas of my class and its an accident that i am of the class to which the future belongsthe working class that will possess the earth as soon as but pursued jane returning to herself i dont intend to be altogether useless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can do something and hemy father i i dont like it said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he said it in such a way that she did not feel rebuked or even judged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id rather lead the life i wish to leadsay the things i believedo the things i believe inall openly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all i can do is to spend the income of my money my mother left me spend it as i please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a quick embarrassed gesture she took an envelope from a small bag in which she was carrying it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres some of it she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to give that to your campaign fund <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are free to use it in any way you pleaseany way for everything you are and do victor was lying motionless his eyes closed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a long silence she watching him uneasily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he said noive no right to refuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i did it would be from a personal motive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you understand that when you give the league this money you are doing what your father would regard as an act you dont think so do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i do said he deliberately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her face became deathly pale then crimson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thrust the envelope into the bag closed it hastily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i cant give if you broke with your father and came with us and it killed him as it probably would victor dorn went on i should respect youshould regard you as a wonderful terrible woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should envy you having a heart strong enough to do a thing so supremely right and so supremely relentless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i should be glad you were not of my bloodshould think you hardly human <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not up to it said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you mustnt do the other said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am false to the cause in urging you not to give it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was looking away an expression in his eyes and about his mouth that made him handsomer than she would have believed a man could be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was looking at him longingly her beautiful eyes swimming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her lips were saying inaudibly i love youi love what did you say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked his thoughts returning from their far journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my time is up she exclaimed rising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are better ways of helping than money said he taking its best not said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish fate had thrown us on the same side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it has put us in opposite camps and we owe it their hands were still clasped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are content to have it so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no im not cried he dropping her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we are we can always hope said she softly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on impulse she laid her hand in light caress upon his brow then swiftly departed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colmans flowery little front yard and looked dazedly about it seemed to her that she had been away from the worldaway from herselfand was reluctantly but inevitably returning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as jane drove into the grounds of the house on the hilltop she saw her father and david hull in an obviously intimate and agitated conversation on the front veranda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made all haste to join them nor was she deterred by the reception she gotthe you are talking about those indictments arent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a group on every corner down town and people are calling their views to each other from windows across the davy glanced triumphantly at her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you so said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old hastings was rubbing his hand over his large bony wizened face in the manner that indicates extreme perplexity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been trying to show your father what a stupid dangerous thing dick kelly has done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want him to help me undo it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be undone or victor dorn will sweep the janes heart was beating wildly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued to say davys got a bad attack of big red eye today said her im right mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and furthermore you know im right jane you saw that riot the other night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said that it was an absolutely unprovoked assault of the gangs of kelly and house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everyone in town knows it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the middle and the upper class people are pretending to believe what the papers printed what theyd like to believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the working people are apparently silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they know the truth they are talking it among themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the not as long as we can keep them divided retorted davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he went on to explain what he had in mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave them an analysis of remsen city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about fifty thousand inhabitants of whom about ten thousand were voters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these voters were divided into three classesupper class with not more than three or four hundred votes and therefore politically of no importance at the polls though overwhelmingly the most influential in any other way the middle class the big and little merchants the lawyers and doctors the agents and firemen and so on mustering in all about two thousand votes finally the working class with no less than eight thousand votes out of a total of ten thousand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by bribery and cajolery and browbeating and appeal to religious prejudice and to fear of losing jobsby all sorts of chicane said davy about seven of these eight thousand votes are kept divided between the republican or kelly party and the democratic or house party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other ten or twelve hundred belong to victor dorns league <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the seven thousand workingmen voters who follow kelly and house like victor dorn like his ideas are with him at heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they are afraid of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont trust each so he is said hastings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but victor dorn has about got the workingmen in this town persuaded that theyd fare better with dorn and the league as their leaders than with kelly and house as their leaders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if kelly goes on to persecute victor dorn the workingmen will be frightened for their rights to free speech and free assembly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i appeal to you i dont know anything about politics said jane looking bored <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must go in and lie down before dinner father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you hastings got ready to rise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this must be settled nowat once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must be in a position not only to denounce this thing but also to stop it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not tomorrow but janes thoughts were flyingbut in circles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody habitually judges everybody else as both more and less acute than he really is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane had great respect for davy as a man of college education <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but because he had no sense of humor and because he abounded in lengthy platitudes she had thought poorly indeed of his abilities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been realizing her mistake in these last few minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man who had made that analysis of politicsan analysis which suddenly enlighted her as to what political power meant and how it was wielded everywhere on earth as well as in remsen citythe man was no mere dreamer and theorist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seen the point no less clearly than had victor dorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what concerned her what set her to fluttering was that he was about to checkmate victor dorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what should she say and do to help victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must get her father away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took him gently by the arm kissed the top of his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill let davy work his excitement off on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must take but hastings resisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait a minute jenny said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i you can think lying down insisted his daughter davy was about to interpose again but she frowned him into silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres something in what davy says persisted her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if that there victor dorn should carry the election thered be no living in the same town with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itd put him away up out of jane abruptly released her fathers arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not thought of thatof how much more difficult victor would be if he won now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wanted him to win ultimatelyyes she was sure she did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wouldnt that put him beyond her reachbeyond need of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was perfunctory loyalty to victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her father settled back davy hull began afresh pressing home his point making his contention so clear that even martin hastings prejudice could not blind him to the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and jane sat on the arm of a big veranda chair and listened and made no further effort to interfere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont agree with you hull said the old man at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor dorns run up agin the law at last and he ought to get mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hastings interrupted davy eagerlytoo fond of talking to realize that the old man was agreeing with him your fiddlefiddle cried the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont bring sentimental women into this davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i was saying victor ought to be punished for the way hes been stirring up idle lazy ignorant people against the men that runs the community and gives em jobs and food for their children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but maybe it aint wise to give him his desertsjust now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow while youve been talking away like a sewing machine ive been thinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see as how it thats it mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if i do exaggerate as you seem to think still wheres the harm in doing it looks as if the respectable people were afraid of the lower but it wont look that way replied davy if my plan is and what might be your plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im to be the reform candidate for mayor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your soninlaw hugo is to be the reform candidate for judge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the way to handle this is for me to come out in a strong statement denouncing the indictments and the injunction against the league and the new day too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ill announce that hugo galland is trying to join in the fight against them and that he is indignant and as determined as i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then early tomorrow morning we can go before judge lansing and can present arguments and he will denounce the other side for misleading him as to the facts and hastings nodded reflectively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pretty good said he with a sly grin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and davy hull and my sonin law will be popular davy reddened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to get all the advantage i can for our party said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he who had been representing honest taxpayers and innocent owners of corrupt stock and bonds all his life understood perfectly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its hardly human to be as unselfish as you and i are davy said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill go in and do a little telephoning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you go ahead and draw up your statement and get it to the papersand see hugo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rose stood leaning on his cane all bent and shrivelled and dry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon judge lansingll be expecting you tomorrow morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned to enter the house halted crooked his head round for a piercing look at young hull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont go talking round among your friends about what youre going to do said he sharply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see you hurrying down to that there university club to sit there and tell it all to those smarties that are always blowing about what theyre going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll be right smart of davy looked abashed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not know which of his many indiscretions of selfglorifying talkativeness mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he could recall several any one of which was justification for the rather savage rebukethe more humiliating that jane was listening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps she had not heard she was gazing into the distance with a strange expression upon her beautiful face an expression that fastened his attention absorbed though he was in his project for jane startled guiltily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ohi dont knowa lot of your look suggested that you were having aa severe attack of conscience said he laughingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was in soaring good humor now for he saw his way clear to election <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was said jane suddenly stern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pause then she laughedrather hollowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy i guess im almost as big a fraud as you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what fakirs we human beings are?always posing as doing for others and always doing for our selfish davys face took on its finest expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think its altogether selfishness for me to fight for victor dorn and give him a chance to get out his paper againwhen he has warned me you know hell not print them now retorted jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know hell not print them now repeated jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every one would forget to ask whether what he said about you was true or false <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd think only of how ungenerous and ungrateful he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but hed seem to beand that comes to the same thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she glanced you are too cynical for a woman jane said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not wellgoodby said davy taking his hat from the rail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got a hard evenings work before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no time for another terrible sacrifice for public duty mocked jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must be frightfully out of humor with yourself to be girding at me so savagely said davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people would rather have one of us than one of their own kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they do look up to us dont they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its ridiculous of them but they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of choosing you when they might have victor he isnt running for mayor objected hull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the leagues no its victor dorn said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the best man in a partythe strongest manis always the candidate for all the offices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know much about politics but ive learned that much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its victor dorn againstdick kellyor kelly and hull reddened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will see who is mayor when im elected said he with all his dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane laughed in the disagreeably mocking way that was the climax of her ability to be nasty when she was thoroughly out of humor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its far more and she went into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davys conduct of the affair was masterly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he showed those rare qualities of judgment and diplomacy that all but insure a man a distinguished career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his statement for the press was a model of dignity of restrained indignation of good common sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most difficult part of his task was getting hugo galland into condition for a creditable appearance in court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in so far as hugos meagre intellect atrophied by education and by luxury permitted him to be a lawyer at all he was of that now common type called the corporation lawyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wished she had gone to her room before tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these people made her feel dowdy and mussy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauline glanced round smiled and nodded turned back to her cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes the wife of a new york lawyer and she takes mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> langdon everywhere with her to amuse her and he goes to amuse himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a socialist or something like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thinks up and says things to shock conservative conventional people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes rich and never has workedcouldnt if he would probably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he denounces leisure classes and large fortunes and advocates manual labor every day for everybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes clever in a queer cynical way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fanshaw also of new york came from the library in a teagown of chiffon and real lace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all were made acquainted and pauline poured the tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as olivia felt shy and was hungry she ate the little sandwiches and looked and listened and thoughtlooked and thought rather than listened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were certainly wellbred people yet she did not like them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre in earnest about trifles she said to herself and trifle about earnest things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet it irritated her to feel that though they would care not at all for her low opinion of them she did care a great deal because they would fail to appreciate her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ought to be jailed langdon was drawling with considerable emphasis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fanshawshe had been as abstracted as olivia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve been filling the jails rapidly today and hanging not a few <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says your husband and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumonts and mine should be locked up as conspirators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll sign a few papers and when theyre done whatll have happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not one more sheepll be raised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not one more pound of wool will be shorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not one more laborerll be employed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a single improvement in any process of manufacture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on the other hand the farmerll have to sell his wool cheaper the consumerll have to pay a bigger price for blankets and all kinds of clothes for carpetsfor everything wool goes into <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and these few men will have trebled their fortunes and at least trebled their incomes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does anybody deny that such a performance is a crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why in comparison a burglar is honorable and courageous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must go at once mowbray and lead the police in a raid on jacks office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> langdon took a piece of a curiouslooking kind of hot bread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> extraordinary good stuff this is he interjected then went on and ive done my duty when ive stated the facts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also im taking a little stock in the new trust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont pose as a captain of industry or promoter of civilization <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my point is the rotten hypocrisy of my fellow banditsno pickpockets by gad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olivia looked at him with disapproving interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time she had been present at a game of battledore and shuttlecock with what she regarded as fundamental morals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> langdon noted her expression and said to pauline in a tone of contrition that did not conceal his amusement ive shocked your cousin mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure we all ought to be shockedand should be if it werent you who are trying to do the shocking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shell soon get used to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not at all my dear mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every word i said was true and worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stop your nonsense mowbray interrupted mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herron who appreciated that olivia was an outsider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> langdon pretends to have eccentric ideasone of them is that everybody with brains should be put under the feet of the numskulls another is that anybody who has anything should be locked up and his property given to those who have nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he took out a gold cigarette case and lighted a large expensivelooking cigarette with a match from a gold safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herron should get you to write our prospectus when were ready to unload on the public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how it does yearn for a share in any piratical enterprise that flies the snowy flag of respectability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me one of your cigarettes mowbray said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i left my case in my room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauline answering olivias expression said as soon as the three why not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it any worse for a woman than for a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know why not replied olivia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there must be another reason than because i dont do it and didnt think ladies did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but thats the only reason i can give just now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think of langdon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess my sense of humors defective <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont like the sort of jest he seems to excel in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fancy it wasnt altogether a jest said pauline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont inquire into those matters any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to butthe more i saw the worse it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tricks and traps and squeezes andoh business is all vulgar and low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its necessary i suppose but its repulsive to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused then added carelessly yet with a certain deliberateness i never meddle with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olivia wished to protest against paulines view of business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buthow could she without seeming to attack indeed without attacking her cousins husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont brought fanshaw up in his automobile herron remaining at the offices for half an hour to give the newspapers a carefully considered account of the muchdiscussed merger of the manufacturers of lowgrade woolens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herron had objected to any statement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its our private business he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fewer facts they have the sooner theyll stop howling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dumont held firm for publicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres no such thing as a private business nowadays he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides dont we want the public to take part of our stock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats the use of acting shadyyouve avoided the legal obstacles havent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets tell the public frankly all we want it to know and itll think it knows all there is to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole party met in the drawingroom at a quarterpast eight langdon the last to come downolivia was uncertain whether or not she was unjust to him when she suspected design in his late entrance the handsomest and the bestdressed man of the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well fellow pirate how go our plans for a merry winter for the poor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> muttered herron to olivia who happened to be nearest him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes devoid of moral sense or even of decency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a traitor to his class and shouldnt be tolerated in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont was laughingly answering langdon in his own vein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> splendidly he replied thanks to our worthy chaplain herron who secures us the blessing and protection of the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feared something might miscarry in these last hours of our months of plotting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heaven be praised the people wont have so much to waste hereafter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im proud to be in one of the many noble bands that are struggling to save them from themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dumont had turned away from him so he dropped into mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fanshaw on their proposed trip to the mediterranean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dinner was announced and he was put between mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herron and olivia with dumont on her right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a round table and olivias eyes lingered upon its detailsthe embroidered cloth with real lace in the center the graceful antique silver candlesticks the tall vases filled with enormous roseseverything exquisitely simple and tasteful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> langdon talked with her until mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herron impatient at his neglect caught his eye and compelled his attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont seeing that olivia was free drew her into his conversation with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fanshaw began to talk with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herron who was eating furiously because he had just overheard langdon say that was a great day for pirates when they thought of taking aboard the lawyers as chaplains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the men were in high spirits dumont was boyish in his exuberance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he left home that morning he was four times a millionaire now he was at least twelve times a millionaire through the magic of the merger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> true eight of the twelve millions were on paper but it was paper that would certainly pay dividends paper that would presently sell at or near its face value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this success had come when he was only thirtyfour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mind was already projecting greater triumphs in this modern necromancy by which millionaires evoke and materialize millions from the empty airapparently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was bubbling over with happinessin the victory won in victories to be won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olivia tried him on several subjects but the conversation dragged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of pauline he would not talk of europe he was interested only in the comfort of hotels and railway trains in the comparative merits of the cooking and the wines in london and paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his facealert shrewd aggressiveand his mode of expression made her feel that he was uninteresting because he was thinking of something which he did not care to expose to her and could not take his mind from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not until she adventured upon his business that he became talkative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and soon she had him telling her about his combinefrankly boastfully his face more and more flushed for as he talked he drank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he said presently this little matter today is only a fair beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed big until it was about accomplished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i saw it was only a suggestion for a scheme thatd be really worth while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he went on to unfold one of those projects of todays commerce and finance that were regarded as fantastic delirious a few years ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would reach out and out for hundreds of millions of capital with his woolens combine as a basis he would build an enormous corporation to control the sheep industry of the worldto buy millions of acres of sheepranges to raise scores of millions of sheep to acquire and to construct hundreds of plants for utilizing every part of the raw product of the ranges to sell wherever the human race had or could have a market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olivia was ambitious herself usually was delighted by ambition in others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his exhibit of imagination and energy repelled her even while it fascinated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> partly through youth more through that contempt for concealment which characterizes the courageous type of large man he showed himself to her just as he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she saw him not as an ambition but as an appetite or rather a bundle of appetites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has no ideals she thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes like a man who wants food merely for itself not for the strength and the intellect it will build up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he likes or dislikes human beings only as one likes or dislikes different things to eat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll take you years and years she said to him because she must say something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waved his handolivia thought it looked as much like a claw as like a hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a skyscraper but we build skyscrapers overnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time and space used to be the big elements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he followed this with a selfsatisfied laugh and an emptying of his champagne glass at a gulp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the women were rising to withdraw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after half an hour langdon and herron joined them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont and fanshaw did not come until eleven oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then dumont was so abrupt and surly that every one was grateful to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fanshaw for taking him away to the west veranda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at midnight all went to their rooms pauline going with olivia to make sure you havent been neglected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lingered until after one and when they kissed each the other good night she said its done me a world of good to see you liviamore even than i hoped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew youd be sympathetic with me where you understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i feel that youre sympathetic where you dont understand too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and its there that one really needs sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what friendship meansandlove said olivia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following afternoon dumont took the herrons the fanshaws and langdon back to new york in his private car and for three days olivia and pauline had the eyrie to themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olivia was about to write to scarborough asking him to call when she saw in the newsbulletin that he had gone to denver to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a week after she left dumont returned bringing his sister gladys just arrived from europe and langdon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stayed four days took langdon away with him and left gladys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus it came about that scarborough riding into colonel gardiners grounds one hot afternoon in mid september saw a phaetonvictoria with two women in it coming toward him on its way out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew his horse aside to make room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was conscious that there were two women he saw only oneshe who was all in white except the scarlet poppies against the brim of her big white hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he bowed the carriage stopped and pauline said cordially why how dye do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew his horse close to the carriage and they shook hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she introduced the other womanmy sisterinlaw gladys dumontthen went on weve been lunching and spending the afternoon with father and mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they told us you returned this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i supposed you were in the east said scarboroughthe first words he had spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ohim living here nowgladys and i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father says you never go anywhere but i hope youll make an exception for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank youill be glad to call <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not dine with usday after tomorrow night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dine at halfpast eightat least were supposed to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why hes not a bit as i expected gladys began at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way a man ought to look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did you look so queer when you first caught sight of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> probably it was because he very suddenly and vividly brought battle field back to methat was the happiest time of my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was too young or too foolish or both to know it till long afterward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at seventeen one takes happiness for granted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did he look then as he does now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was just from the farm and dressed badly and was awkward at times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butreally he was the same person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess it was the little change in him that startled me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she became absorbed in her thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope youll send him in to dinner with me said gladys presently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked if you wouldnt send him in to dinner with meunless you want to discuss old times with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and pauline gave scarborough to gladys and did her duty as hostess by taking in the dullest man in the partynewnham <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while newnham droned and prosed she watched gladys lay herself out to please the distinguished mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarborough successful as a lawyer famous as an orator deferred to because of his influence with the rank and file of his party in the middle west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gladys had blueblack hair which she wore pulled out into a sort of halo about her small delicate face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were points of light in her dark irises giving them the look of black quartz in the sunshine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not tall but her figure was perfect and she had her dresses fitted immediately to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her appeal was frankly to the senses the edge taken from its audacity by its artistic effectiveness and by her ingenuous almost innocent expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing pauline looking at her she tilted her head to a graceful angle and sent a radiant glance between two blossomladen branches of the green and white bush that towered and spread in the center of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarborough says she called out character isnt a development its a disclosure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thinks one is born a certain kind of person and that ones life simply either gives it a chance to show or fails to give it a chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says the boy isnt father to the man but the miniature of the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent thought of it replied pauline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarboroughs ideas sometimes but i learned better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she realized the implications of her careless remark their eyes met squarely for the first time since battle field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both hastily glanced away and neither looked at the other again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the men came up to the drawingroom to join the women gladys adroitly intercepted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he went to pauline to take leave their manner each toward the other was formal strained and even distant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont came again just after the november election <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been an unexpected victory for the party which scarborough advocated and everywhere the talk was that he had been the chief factorhis skill in defining issues his eloquence in presenting them the public confidence in his party through the dominance of a man so obviously free from selfseeking or political trickery of any kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont to whom control in both party machines and in the state government was a business necessity told his political agent merriweather that they had let scarborough go about far enough unless he could be brought into their camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant make out what hes looking for said merriweather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one things certainhell do us no good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres no way we can get our hooks in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dont give a damn for money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as for powerhe can get more of that by fighting us than by falling in line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this seemed to dumont rank ingratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he not just divided a million dollars among charities and educational institutions in the districts where opposition to his merger was strongest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he isnt careful well have to kill him off in convention and make the committees stop his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trouble is hes been building up a following of his ownthe sort of following that cant be honeyfugled replied merriweather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the committees are afraid of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> merriweather always took the gloomy view of everything because he thus discounted his failures in advance and doubled the effect of his successes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill seeill see said dumont impatiently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he thought he was beginning to see when gladys expanded to him upon the subject of scarboroughhis good looks his wit his distinction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarborough came to dinner a few evenings later and dumont was particularly cordial to him and gladys made the most of the opportunity which pauline again gave her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night when the others had left or had gone to bed gladys followed her brother into the smokeroom adjoining the library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sat in silence drinking a nightcap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the dreaminess of her eyes in the absent smile drifting round the corners of her full red lips gladys showed that her thoughts were pleasant and sentimental <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think of scarborough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she started but did not flushin her long european experience she had gained control of that signal of surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rarely answered a question immediately no matter how simple it was but usually put another question in reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus she insured herself time to think if time should be necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean do you like him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ive seen him only a few times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes an uncommon man continued her brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hed make a mighty satisfactory husband for an ambitious woman especially one with the money to push him fast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gladys slowly lifted and slowly lowered her smooth slender shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that sort of thing doesnt interest a woman in a man unless shes married to him and has got over thinking more about him than about herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it ought to replied her brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a clever woman can always slosh round in sentimental slop with her head above it and cool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were a girl id make a dead set for that chap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you were a girl said gladys youd do nothing of the sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd compel him to make a dead set for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as she put down her glass she gave his hair an affectionate pullwhich was her way of thanking him for saying what she most wished to hear on the subject she most wished to hear about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gladys was now twentyfour and was even more anxious to marry than is the average unmarried person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been eleven years a wanderer she was tired of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had no home and she wanted a home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her aunther mothers widowed sisterhad taken her abroad when she was thirteen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john was able to defy or to deceive their mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she could and did enforce upon gladys the rigid rules which her fanatical nature had evolveda minute and crushing tyranny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore gladys preferred any place to her home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for ten years she had been roaming western europe nominally watched by her lazy selfish and physically and mentally nearsighted aunt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> actually her only guardian had been her own precocious curiously prudent curiously reckless self <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been free to do as she pleased and she had pleased to do very free indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had learned all that her intense and catholic curiosity craved to know had learned it of masters of her own selectingthe men and women who would naturally attract a lively young person eager to rejoice in an escape from slavery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes had peered far into the human heart farthest into the corrupted human heart yet with her innocence she had not lost her honesty or her preference for the things she had been brought up to think clean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she had at last wearied of a novelty which lay only in changes of scene and of names without any important change in characters or plot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she began to be bored with the game of baffling the hopes inspired by her beauty and encouraged by her seeming simplicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when her mother cameas she said to pauline the only bearable view of mother is a distant view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had forgot there were such people left on earthi had thought theyd all gone to their own kind of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she fled to america to her brother and his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont stayed eight days at the eyrie on that trip then went back to his congenial life in new yorkto his business and his dissipation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tempered his indulgence in both nowadays with some exercisehis stomach his heart his nerves and his doctor had together given him a bad fright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the evening before he left he saw pauline and gladys sitting apart and joined them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not invite scarborough to spend a week up here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked just glancing at his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never ventured to look at her when there was any danger of their eyes meeting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her lips tightened and the color swiftly left her cheeks and swiftly returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh do ask him pauline said gladys with enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like her brother she always went straight to the pointshe was in the habit of deciding for herself of thinking what she did was above criticism and of not especially caring if it was criticised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauline waited longit seemed to her long enough for time to wrinkle her heartbefore answering well need another man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gladys pressed her hand gratefullyshe was fond of pauline and pauline was liking her again as she had when they were children and playmates and partners in the woes of john dumonts raids upon their games <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barrow called gladys to the other end of the drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think itd be a good match he said reflectively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paulines heart missed a beat and a suffocating choke contracted her throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ought to marryshes got no place to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and itd be good business for herand for him too for that matter if she could land him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think shes attractive to men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think it would be a good match <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very she said looking round wildly as her breath came more and more quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> am i interrupting a family council <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this room is too warm said pauline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went into the hall threw a golf cape round her shoulders and stepped out on the veranda closing the doorwindow behind her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a moonless winter nightstars thronging the blueblack sky the steady lamp of a planet set in the southern horizon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had been walking there for a quarter of an hour the doorwindow opened and langdon looked out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her tone assured him that he would not be intruding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got a hat and overcoat and they walked up and down together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those stars irritate me he said after a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they make me appreciate that this worlds a tiny grain of sand adrift in infinity and that imtheres nothing little enough to express the human atom where the earths only a grain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they go on to taunt me with how shortlived i am and how itll soon be all over for mefor ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a futile little insect buzzing about waiting to be crushed under the heel of the great executioner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i feel that answered pauline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but againoften as a childand since when everything has looked dark and ugly for me ive gone where i could see them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they seemed to draw all the fever and the fear out of me and to put there instead a sort ofnot happiness not even content butcourage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were near the rail now she gazing into the southern sky he studying her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him that he had not seen any one so beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was all in black with a diamond star glittering in her hair high above her forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked like a splendid plume dropped from the starry wing of night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stars make you feel that way he said in the light tone that disguises a compliment as a bit of raillery because youre of their family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i feel as i do because im a bloodrelation of the earthworms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she exclaimed with a passion he had never seen or suspected in her before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she drew a long breath closed her eyes and opened them very wide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know you cant imagine how i long to live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and know what to live means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he askedhe liked to catch people in their confidential moods and to peer into the hidden places in their hearts not impudently but with a sort of scientific curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because im a daughterthats anchor number one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because im a motherthats anchor number two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because im a wifethats anchor number three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and anchor number fourbecause im under the spell of inherited instincts that rule me though i dont in the least believe in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the skeleton at lifes banquet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughed without mirth then sighed with some selfmockery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it frightens me away from the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however he did come to dinner ten days later and gladys who had no lack of confidence in her power to charm when and whom she chose was elated by his friendliness then and when she met him at other houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes not a bit sentimental she told pauline whose silence whenever she tried to discuss him did not discourage her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if he ever does care for a woman hell care in the same tremendous way that he sweeps things before him in his career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had now lingered at saint x two months beyond the time she originally set <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told herself she had reached the limit of endurance that she must fly from the spectacle of gladys growing intimacy with scarborough she told gladys it was impossible for her longer to neglect the new house in fifth avenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with an effort she added youd rather stay on here wouldnt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i detest new york replied gladys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ive never enjoyed myself in my whole life as im enjoying it here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she went east alone went direct to dawn hill their country place at manhasset long island which dumont never visited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she invited leonora fanshaw down to stand between her thoughts and herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the society of a human being one who was lighthearted and amusing could tide her back to any sort of peace in the old lifeher books and her dogs her horseback and her drawing and her gardening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a life so full of events so empty of event <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it left her hardly time for proper sleep yet it had not a single one of those vivid threads of intense and continuous interestand one of them is enough to make bright the dullest pattern that issues from the loom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in her splendor her nearest approach to an intimacy had been with leonora <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had no illusions about the company she was keeping in the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to her these friends seemed in no proper sense either her friends or one anothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drawn together from all parts of america indeed of the world by the magnetism of millions they had known one another not at all or only slightly in the period of life when thorough friendships are made even where they had been associates as children the association had rarely been of the kind that creates friendships democratic intimacy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had no common traditions no real classfeeling no common enthusiasmsunless the passion for keeping rich for getting richer for enjoying and displaying riches could be called enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were mere intimate acquaintances making small pretense of friendship having small conception of it or desire for it beyond that surface politeness which enables people whose selfish interests lie in the same direction to get on comfortably together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she divided them into two classes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were those who like herself kept up great establishments and entertained lavishly and engaged in the courteous but fierce rivalry of fashionable ostentation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there were those who hung about the courts of the rich invited because they filled in the large backgrounds and contributed conversation or ideas for new amusements accepting because they loved the atmosphere of luxury which they could not afford to create for themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leonora was undeniably in the latter class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she was associated in paulines mind with the period before her splendor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been friendly when dumont was unknown beyond saint x <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others sought herwell for the same reasons of desire for distraction and dread of boredom which made her welcome them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but leonora she more than half believed liked her to a certain extent for herselflikes me better than i like her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at times she was selfreproachful for being thus exceeded in selfgiving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leonora for example told her her most intimate secrets some of them far from creditable to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sometimes longed for a confidant or rather for some person who would understand without being told some one like olivia but her imagination refused to picture leonora as that kind of friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even more pronounced than her frankness and she was frank to her own hurt was her biting cynicismit was undeniably amusing it did not exactly inspire distrust but it put pauline vaguely on guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also she was candidly mercenary and in some moods rapaciously envious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no worse thought pauline than so many of the others here once one gets below their surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides its in a goodnatured goodhearted way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wished fanshaw were as rich as leonora longed for him to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was glad dumont seemed to be putting him in the way of making a fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was distasteful to her because she saw that he was an illtempered sycophant under a pretense of manliness thick enough to shield him from the unobservant eyes of a world of men and women greedy of flattery and busy each with himself or herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for leonoras sake she invited him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and leonora was appreciative was witty never monotonous or commonplace most helpful in getting up entertainments and good to look atalways beautifully dressed and as fresh as if just from a bath sparkling green eyes usually with goodhumored mockery in them hard smooth glistening shoulders and arms lips a crimson line at once cold and sensuous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a friday in december pauline came up from dawn hill and after two hours at the new house went to the jewelers to buy a wedding present for aurora galloway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she was passing the counter where the superintendent had his office his assistant said beg pardon mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the necklace came in this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you like to look at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused not clearly hearing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took a box from the safe behind him and lifted from it a magnificent necklace of graduated pearls with a huge solitaire diamond clasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its one of the finest we ever got together he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you can see for yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was flushing in the excitement of his eagerness to ingratiate himself with such a distinguished customer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said pauline taking the necklace as he held it out to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i ask whom its for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clerk looked puzzled then frightened as the implications of her obvious ignorance dawned upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ohii he almost snatched it from her dropped it into the box put on the lid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he stood with mouth ajar and forehead beaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please give it to me again said pauline coldly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not finished looking at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his uneasy eyes spied the superintendent approaching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he grew scarlet then white and in an agony of terror blurted out here comes the superintendent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont dont tell him i showed it to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive made some sort of a mistake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll ruin me if you speak of it to any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never thought it might be intended as a surprise to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed i wasnt supposed to know anything about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe i was mistaken his look and voice were so pitiful that pauline replied reassuringly i understandill say nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please show me those and she pointed to a tray of unset rubies in the showcase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the superintendent bowing obsequiously came up himself to take charge of this important customer she was deep in the rubies which the assistant was showing her with hands that shook and fingers that blundered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not permit her feelings to appear until she was in her carriage again and secure from observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clerks theory she could not entertain for an instant contradicted as it was by the facts of eight years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew she had surprised dumont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had learned nothing new but it forced her to stare straight into the face of that which she had been ignoring that which she must continue to ignore if she was to meet the ever heavier and crueler exactions of the debt she had incurred when she betrayed her father and mother and herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at a time when her mind was filled with bitter contrasts between what was and what might have been it brought bluntly to her the precise kind of life she was leading the precise kind of surroundings she was tolerating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whom can he be giving such a gift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she had an impulse to confide in leonora to the extent of encouraging her to hint who it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt everybody knows except me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she called for her as she had promised and took her to lunch at sherrys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the impulse to confide died as leonora talkedof money of ways of spending money of people who had money and those who hadnt money of people who were spending too much money of those who werent spending enough money of what she would do if she had money of what many did to get money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> money money moneyit was all of the web and most of the woof of her talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it ran boldly on the surface of the pattern now it was half hid under something about art or books or plays or schemes for patronizing the poor and undermining their selfrespectbut it was always there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time leonora jarred upon her fiercelyunendurably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she listened until the sound grew indistinct became mingled with the chatter of that moneyflaunting throng <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and presently the chatter seemed to her to be a maddening repetition of one word moneythe central idea in all the thought and all the action of these people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must get away she thought or i shall cry out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she left abruptly alleging that she must hurry to catch her train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only test of honormoney and ability and willingness to spend it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they must have money or theyre nobodies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if they have money who cares where it came from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one asks where the men get itwhy should any one ask where the women get it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few days afterwardit was a wednesdaypauline came up to town early in the afternoon as she had an appointment with the dressmaker and was going to the opera in the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the dressmakers while she waited for a fitter to return from the workroom she glanced at a newspaper spread upon the table so that its entire front page was in view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was filled with an account of how the woolens monopoly had in that bitter winter advanced prices twenty to thirtyfive per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the center of the page stared a picture of john dumontits expression peculiarly arrogant and sinister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she read the headlines only then turned from the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on the drive uptown she stopped the carriage at the savoy and sent the footman to the newsstand to get the paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she read the article throughparts of it several times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had langdon and honoria longview at dinner that night by indirect questioning she drew him on to confirm the article to describe how the woolens monopoly was giving the country an oldfashioned winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the way to the opera she was ashamed of her ermine wrap enfolding her from the slightest sense of the icy air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not hear the singers was hardly conscious of her surroundings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they left the metropolitan she threw back her wrap and sat with her neck bared to the intense cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reluctantly drew the fur about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when she had dropped him and then honoria and was driving on up the avenue alone she bared her shoulders and arms againlike a silly child she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it gave her a certain satisfaction for she felt like one who has a secret store of food in time of famine and feasts upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked the butler as he closed the door of their palace behind her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please tell him id like to see himin the library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had to wait only three or four minutes before he camein smoking jacket and slippers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was long since she had looked at him so carefully as she did then and she noted how much grosser he was the puffs under his eyes the lines of cruelty that were coming out strongly with autocratic power and the custom of receiving meek obedience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the incident of the necklace and its reminders of all she had suffered from him and through him came trooping into her mind and it seemed to her that she could not speak could not even remain in the room with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dropped into a chair before the open fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slowly lighted a cigar and began to smoke it his attitude one of waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been thinking she began at lastshe was looking reflectively into the fireabout your great talent for business and finance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you formed your big combination and because you understand everything about wool you employ more men you pay higher wages and you make the goods better than ever and at less cost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between a third and a half cheaper he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we employ thirty thousand more men and since we settled the last strikea grim smile that would have meant a great deal to her had she known the history of that strike and how hard he had fought before he gave inweve paid thirty per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet the profits arewell you can imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youve made millions for yourself and for those in with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent developed my ideas for nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a doctor or a man of science or a philosopher makes a discovery thatll be a benefit to the worldshe looked at him suddenly earnest appealinghe gives it freely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he gets honor and fame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why shouldnt you do that john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had forgotten herself in her subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he smiled into the firehardly a day passed that he did not have presented to him some scheme for relieving him of the burden of his riches here was another and from such an unexpected quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we spend twenty fifty times as much as we can possibly enjoy and you have more than we could possibly spend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why shouldnt a man with financial genius be like men with other kinds of genius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should he be the only one to stay down on the level with dull moneygrubbing sordid kinds of people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed so earnest was she that she did not just think john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of giving out in these charities and philanthropiesi never did believe in themtheyre bound to be more or less degrading to the people that take and when its so hard to help a friend with money without harming him how much harder it must be to help strangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of those things why not be really great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just think john how the world would honor you and how you would feel if you used your genius to make the necessaries cheap for all these fellowbeings of ours who have such a hard time getting on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be real superiorityand our life now is so vain so empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked curious as always when a new idea was presented to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this was certainly newapparently philanthropy without expense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can do as you please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not put your great combine on such a basis that it would bring an honest just return to you and the others and would pay the highest possible wages and would give the people the benefit of what your genius for manufacturing and for finance has made possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we who are so comfortable and never have to think of the necessaries of life forget how much a few cents here and there mean to most people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the things you control mean all the difference between warmth and cold between life and death john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she talked he settled back into his chair and his face hardened into its unyielding expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just like a good sentimental woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not philanthropy without expense but philanthropy at the expense both of his fortune and of his position as a master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to use his brain and his life for those ungrateful people who derided his benefactions as either contributions to the conscience fund or as indirect attempts at public bribery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not conceal his impatiencethough he did not venture to put it into words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if weif you and i john she hurried on leaning toward him in her earnestness had something like that to live for it might come to be very different with usandim thinking of gardiner most of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one no one can lead this kind of life without being dragged down without becoming selfish and sordid and cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont understand he said curtly without looking at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never heard of suchsuch sentimentalism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she winced and was silent sat watching his bold strong profile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she said in a changed strange strained voice what i asked to see you for wasjohn wont you put the pricesat least where they were at the beginning of this dreadful winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve been listening to the lies about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reading she said her eyes flashing at the insult in the accusation that she had let people attack him to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well reading then he went on wondering what he had said that angered her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he made an elaborate explanationabout the necessity of meeting fixed charges which he himself had fixed about fair share of prosperity everything more expensive the country better able to pay every one doing as we are and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she listened closely she had not come ignorant of the subject and she penetrated his sophistries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he saw her expression saw he had failed to convince her into his eyes came the look she understood wellthe look that told her she would only infuriate him and bruise herself by flinging herself against the iron of his resolve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must let me attend to my own business he ended his tone goodnatured his eyes hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat staring into the fire for several minutesfrom her eyes looked a will as strong as his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she rose and her voice lower than before but vibrating said all round ushere in new yorkall over this countryaway off in europei can see themi can feel themsuffering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as you yourself said its horribly cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she drew herself up and faced him a light in her eyes before which he visibly shrank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it shant be mine or my boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning she returned to dawn hill and arranged her affairs so that she would be free to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not since the spring day nearly nine years before when she began that vergil lesson which ended in a lesson in the pitilessness of consequences that was not yet finished had her heart been so light so hopeful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain she reminded herself that the doing of this larger duty so imperative nevertheless endangered her father and mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will be proud that im doing it she assured herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gardiners sake as well as for mine theyll be glad i separated him and myself from this debased life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they willthey must since it is right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and already she felt the easing of the bonds that had never failed to cut deeper into the living flesh whenever she had ventured to hope that she was at last growing used to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dared to exult but she did not dare to express to herself the hopes the wild incredible hopes which the very thought of freedom set to quivering deep down in her as the first warmth makes the life toss in its slumber in the planted seed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on friday she came up to new york late in the afternoon and in the evening went to the operafor a last look round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the lights were lowering for the rise of the curtain on the second act leonora and her husband entered the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave leonora the chair in front and took the one behindmillicent rowland whom she herself brought had the other front seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as her chair was midway between the two she was seeing across leonoras shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently dumont came in and took the chair behind leonoras and leaned forward his chin almost touching the slope of her neck as he talked to her in an undertone she greatly amused or pretending to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light from the stage fell across leonoras bosom fell upon a magnificent string of graduated pearls clasped with a huge solitaire beyond question the string the jewelers clerk had blunderingly shown her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there was dumonts heavy coarse profile outlined against leonoras cheek and throat her cynical sensuous profile showing just beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> open sprang a hundred doors of memory into paulines mind was discharged avalanche after avalanche of dreadful thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how infamous to think such things of my best friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she tried in vain to thrust suspicions accusations proofs back into the closets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead she sank under the flood of themsick and certain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the lights went up she said im feeling badly all at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid ill have to take you home milly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh nojust faint she replied in a voice which she succeeded in making fairly natural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other manshenstonehelped her and millicent with their wraps and accompanied them to their carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had set millicent down she drew a long breath of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time in seven years her course lay straight before her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must be entirely freefree before the whole worldi and my boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning in the midst of her preparations to take the tenoclock limited for the west her maid brought a note to hera copy of a national woolens company circular to the trade setting forth that owing to a gratifying easing in the prices for raw wool the company are able to announce and take great pleasure in announcing a ten per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the margin dumont had scrawled to go out tomorrow and to be followed in ten days by fifteen per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus by the sheer luck that had so often supplemented his skill and mitigated his mistakes he had yielded to her plea just in time to confuse the issue between her and him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she read the circular and the scrawl with a sinking heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> true he wont send out this circular if i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what does it matter one infamy more or less in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides he will accomplish his purpose in some other way of which i shall not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this was only the beginning of the battle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> punishment on punishment for an act which seemed right at the time had made her morbid distrustful of herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she could not conquer the dread lest her longing to be free was blinding her was luring her on to fresh calamities involving all whom she cared for all who cared for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whichever way she looked she could see only a choice between wrongs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to stay under the same roof with him or at dawn hillselfrespect put that out of the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to free herselfhow could she when it meant sacrificing her parents and also the thousands shivering under the extortions of his monopoly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the end she chose the course that seemed to combine the least evil with the most good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would go to the eyrie and the world and her father and mother would think she was absenting herself from her husband to attend to the bringing up of her boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would see even less of scarborough than she saw when she was last at saint x <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since we had our talk i have found out about leonora <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is impossible for me to stay here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i shall not go to my fathers because of your circular i shall go to the eyrie insteadat least for the present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two weeks after she was again settled at the eyrie langdon appeared in saint x alleging business at the national woolens factories there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he accepted her invitation to stay with her and devoted himself to gladys who took up her flirtation with him precisely where she had dropped it when they bade each the other a mockmournful goodby five months before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were so realistic that pauline came to the satisfying conclusion that her sisterinlaw was either in earnest with langdon or not in earnest with anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she had not been avoiding scarborough she would probably have seen gladys real gameto use langdon as a stalking horse for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt scarborough like all men imagines hes above jealousy gladys had said to herself casting her keen eyes over the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there never was a man who didnt race better with a pacemaker than on an empty track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toward the end of langdons first week paulines suspicions as to one of the objects of his winter trip west were confirmed by his saying quite casually dumonts dropped fanshaw and leonoras talking of the stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact shes gone abroad to study <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he was leaving after nearly three weeks he asked her when she was coming back east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neveri hope she said her fingers playing with the closecropped curls of her boy standing beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fancied soi fancied so replied langdon his eyes showing that he understood her and that he knew she understood for whom he had asked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are going to stay onat the eyrie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive not made up my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fate plays such queer tricks that ive stopped guessing at tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was it miss dumonts friend scarborough quoted from spinoza at atwaters the other night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a stone on its way from the sling through the air could speak it would say how free i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is that the way you feel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came into paulines eyes a look of pain so intense that he glanced away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we choose a path blindfold she said her tone as light as her look was dark and we must go where it goestheres no other ever afterward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the paths lead up she replied with a sad smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the precipices that lead down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well goodby miss dumontdont get married till you see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he patted the boy on the shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodby gardinerremember we men must always be brave and gentle with the ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you should want to come back to us youll have no trouble in finding us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were a lot of slow old rotters and well be just where you left usyawning and shying at new people and at all new ideas except about clothes and gossiping about each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he was in the auto and off for the station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarborough often rode with gladys and pauline sometimes with gladys alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one afternoon in august he came expecting to go out with both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but gladys was not well that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had examined her pale face and deeply circled eyes in her glass she had counseled with her maida discreetly and soothingly frank french woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too late to telephone him she had overruled her longing to see him and had decided that at what she hoped was his critical stage it would be wiser not to show herself to him thus even in her most becoming teagown which compelled the eyes of the beholder to a fascinating game of hide and seek with her neck and arms and the lines of her figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired scarborough of the servant who brought gladys message and note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarborough rode away taking the long drive through the grounds of the eyrie as it would save him a mile of dusty and not wellshaded highway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few hundred yards and he was passing the sloping meadows that lay golden bronze in the sun beyond the narrow fringe of wood skirting and shielding the drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grass and clover had been cut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> part of it was spread where it had fallen part had been raked into little hillocks ready for the wagons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the edge of one of these hillocks far down the slope he saw the tail of a pale blue skirt a white parasol cast upon the stubble beside it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reined in his horse hesitated dismounted tied his bridle round a sapling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he strode across the field toward the hillock that had betrayed its secret to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called when he was still far enough away not to be taking her by surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused debating whether to call again or to turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but soon she was risingthe lower part of her tall narrow figure hid by the hillock the upper part revealing to him the strong stamp of that vivid individuality of hers which separated her at once from no matter what company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had on a big garden hat trimmed just a little with summer flowers a blouse of some soft white material with even softer lace on the shoulders and in the long loose sleeves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave a friendly nod and glance in his direction and said oh nonot at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im glad to have help in enjoying this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was looking out toward the mists of the horizon hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heat of the day had passed the woods the hillocks of hay were casting long shadows on the palebronze fields <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a breeze had sprung up and was lifting from the dried and drying grass and clover a keen sweet intoxicating perfumelike the odor which classic zephyrs used to shake from the flowing hair of woodland nymphs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood beside her without speaking looking intently at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time he had been alone with her since the afternoon at battle field when she confessed her marriage and he his love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bandit was lame she said when it seemed necessary to say something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rode a thoroughbred bandit who would let no one else mount him whenever she got a new saddle she herself had to help put it on so alert was he for schemes to entrap him to some others service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he obeyed her in the haughty nervous way characteristic of thoroughbredsobeyed because he felt that she was without fear and because she had the firm but gentle hand that does not fret a horse yet does not let him think for an instant that he is or can be free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then too he had his share of the universal fundamental vanity we should probably find swelling the oyster did we but know how to interpret it and he must have appreciated what an altogether harmonious spectacle it was when he swept along with his mistress upon his back as light and free as a valkyr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sorry to miss the ride pauline went on after another pauseto her riding was the keenest of the many physical delights that are for those who have vigorous and courageous bodies and sensitive nerves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever it was possible she fought out her battles with herself on horseback usually finding herself able there to drown mental distress in the surge of physical exultation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he still did not speak she looked at himand could not look away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not seen that expression since their final hour together at battle field though in these few last months she had been remembering it so exactly had been wondering doubting whether she could not bring it to his face again had been forbidding herself to long to see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there it was unchanged like all the inflexible purposes that made his character and his career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and back to her came as it had come many and many a time in those years the story he had told her of his father and mother of his fathers love for his motherhow it had enfolded her from the harshness and peril of pioneer life had enfolded her in age no less than in youth had gone down into and through the valley of the shadow with her had not left her even at the gates of death but had taken him on with her into the beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and pauline trembled an enormous joy thrilling through and through her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont look at me like that please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were crying he said abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood before her obviously one who had conquered the respect of the world in fair open battle and has the courage that is for those only who have tested their strength and know it will not fail them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the sight of him the look of him filled her not with the mere belief but with the absolute conviction that no malign power in all the world or in the mystery round the world could come past him to her to harass or harm her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doubts the sense of desolation that had so agitated her a few minutes before now seemed trivial weak unworthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lowered her eyesshe had thought he would not observe the slight traces of the tears she had carefully wiped away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she clasped her hands meekly and lookedand feltlike a guilty child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coldness the haughtiness were gone from her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesii she lifted her eyesher tears had made them as soft and luminous as the eyes of a child just awake from a long untroubled sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its nothing that can be helped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you knew what a comfort it is to cry youd try it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then after a pause he added once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something in his toneshe did not venture to look at him againmade her catch her breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she instantly and instinctively knew when that once was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care to try it again thank you he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it made me able to understand what sort of comfort you were getting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the katydids were clamoring drowsily in the tops of the sycamores <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from out of sight beyond the orchard came the monotonous musical whir of a reaper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a quail whistled his pert hopeful careless bob white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the rail fence edging the wheat field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a bumblebee grumbled among a cluster of swaying clover blossoms which the mower had spared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the breeze tossed up and rolled over the meadow over the senses of the young man and the young woman great billows of that perfume which is the combined essence of all natures love philters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauline sank on the hay and scarborough stretched himself on the ground at her feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a long time its been getting darker and darker for me she began in the tone of one who is talking of some past sorrow which casts a retreating shadow over present joy to make it the brighter by contrast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> todaythis afternoon it seemed as if the light were just about to go outfor good and all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found myself lying on the groundon the bosom of this old cruelkind mother of ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she did not finishhe would know the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said if only there were some way in which i could help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt the people who appear at the crises of ones life like the hero on the stage that really help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid the crises the real crises of real life must always be met alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alone he said in an undertone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sky was blue nowcloudless blue but in that word alone he could hear the rumble of storms below the horizon storms past storms to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the real helpers she went on are those who strengthen us day by day hour by hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when no physical presence would do any good when no outside aid is possibletheyits like finding a wall at ones back when ones in dread of being surrounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you dont realize how much it means toto how many peopleto watch a man who goes straight and strong on his waywithout blustering without trampling anybody without taking any mean advantage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont mind my saying these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt the look which she did not venture to face as he answered i needed to hear them today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it seemed to me that i too had got to the limit of my strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive thought so before but somehow ive always managed to gather myself together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time it was the work of years apparently undonehopelessly undone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyshe understood that they meant the leaders of the two corrupt rings whose rule of the state his power with the people menacedthey have bought away some of my best menbought them with those favors that are so much more disreputable than money because theyre respectable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they came to mehe laughed unpleasantlyand took me up into a high mountain and showed me all the kingdoms of the earth as it were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could be governor senator they said could probably have the nomination for president evennot if i would fall down and worship them but if i would let them alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could accomplish nearly all that ive worked so long to accomplish if i would only concede a few things to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almostthat is not free at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said and they knew you no better than that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he continued it looks as if ill have to build all over again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they werent still afraid of you theyd never have come to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont fight for victory you fight for the fights sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and soshe looked at him proudlyyou cant lose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you he said in a low voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i feel as if i were sitting in a railway station waiting to begin my journeywaiting for a train thats latenobody knows how late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a great deal he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was looking round at the sky at the horizon at the fields far and near at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i should live on through anything and everything because away down under the surface where even the worst storms cant reach theres always a sort of tremendous joythe sense of being alivejust alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often when ive beenanything but happya little while ago for instancei suddenly have a feeling of ecstasy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say to myself yes im unhappy butim alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made a sudden impulsive movement toward her then restrained himself pressed his lips together and fell back on his elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i ought to be ashamed of myself she added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sitting up was speaking with all his energy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that you were telling me a while ago to encourage me applies to you tooand moremore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are what you long to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that ideal youre always trying to graspdont you know why you cant grasp it pauline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because its your own self your own image reflected as in a mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he broke off abruptly acutely conscious that he was leaning far over the barrier between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a distant shout from vigorous boyish lungs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gardiner mad with the joy of healthy seven came running and jumping across the field to land with a leap astride the hillock scattering wisps of hay over his mother and scarborough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauline turned without getting up caught her boy by the arms and with mock violence shook and thrust him deep down into the damaged hillock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to be making an outlet for some happiness too great to be contained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laughed and shouted and struggled pushed and pulled her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her hat fell off her hair loosened and the sun showered gold of many shades upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she released him and stood up straightening and smoothing her hair and breathing quickly the color high in her cheeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarborough was already standing watching her with an expression of great cheerfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the caravanhis tone was halfjesting halfserioushas been spending the heat and dust of the day on the oasis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there are the starsand the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy close to his mother and facing scarborough was looking from her to him and back againcuriously it almost seemed suspiciously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both noticed it both flushed slightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarborough shook hands with her bowed to the little boy with a formality and constraint that might have seemed ludicrous to an onlooker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went toward his horse gardiner and his mother took the course at right angles across the field in the direction in which the towers of the eyrie could be seen above the treetops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly the boy said as if it were the conclusion of a long internal argument i like mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ii dont know replied the boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish hed come and stay with us and aunt gladys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reminder made her uncomfortable made her feel that she ought to be remorseful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she hastened on to defend herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what reason had she to believe that gladys cared for him except as she always cared for difficult conquest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hadnt gladys again and again gone out of her way to explain that she wasnt in love with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hadnt she said only two days before i dont believe i could fall in love with any man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly i couldnt unless he had made it very clear to me that he was in love with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauline had latterly been suspecting that these elaborations of superfluous protestation were gladys efforts to curtain herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now she dwelt upon them with eager pleasure and assured and reassured herself that she had been supersensitive and that gladys had really been frank and truthful with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his way down the bluffs to town scarborough felt as calm and peaceful as that tranquil evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a sense of the end of a long strain of which he had until then been unconscious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i can go away and rest he said to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at sundown he set out for his farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he arrived at ten oclock by moonlight amid a baying of dogs so energetic that it roused every living thing in the barnyard to protest in a peevish chorus of clucking and grunting and quacking and squealing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabbard his farmers wife standing at the back door in calico skirt and big shawl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she saw who it was her irritated voice changed to welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it was old john lovel among the chickens or at the granary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might a knowed he wouldnt come in the full of the moon and no clouds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go straight back to bed mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabbard and dont mind me said scarborough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked after my horse and dont want anything to eat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the pause a lusty snore penetrated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when anything out of the way happens i get up and nose around to see whether its worth while to wake him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive come for a few daysto get some exercise he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dont wake me with the others tomorrow morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im away behind on sleep and dead tired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went to bedthe rooms upstairs in front were reserved for him and were always ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his brain was apparently as busy and as determined not to rest as on the worst of his many bad nights during the past four months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the thoughts were vastly different and soon those millions of monotonous murmurings from brook and field and forest were soothing his senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slept soundly with that complete relaxing of every nerve and muscle which does not come until the mind wholly yields up its despotic control and itself plunges into slumber unfathomable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the change of the air with dawn slowly wakened him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only a little after five but he felt refreshed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got himself into farm working clothes and went down to the summer diningrooma shed against the back of the house with three of its walls latticed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabbard and her daughters sally and bertha were washing the breakfast dishesgabbard and his two sons and the three hands had just started for the meadows with the hay wagons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good morning said scarborough looking in on the three women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stopped work and smiled at him and the girls dried their hands and shook hands with himall with an absolute absence of embarrassment that to one familiar with the awkward shyness of country people would have told almost the whole story of scarboroughs character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill get you some breakfast in the diningroom said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nojust a littleon the corner of the table out here replied scarborough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabbard and sally bustled about while he stood in the doorway of the shed looking out into the yard and watching the hens make their careful early morning tour of the inclosure to glean whatever might be there before scattering for the days excursions and depredations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not long to wait and he did not linger over what was served <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve et in a manner nothing complained mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent earned an appetite yet he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as he was out of view he gave a great shout and started to run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what folly to bother with a foolish troublebreeding thinking apparatus in a world like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought as the tremendous currents of vitality surged through him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he vaulted a sixrail fence and ran on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down the hollow drenched with dew across the brook which was really wide enough to be called a creek up the steep slope of the opposite hill at a slower pace and he was at the edge of the meadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was clear of the horizon now and the two wagons piled high with hay and poled down to keep the loads steady were about to move off to the barn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bring back a fork for me bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called to the driver of the nearer wagonbill was standing on the lofty top of his load which projected forward and rear so far that forward the horses were half canopied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> against bills return he borrowed gabbards fork and helped complete the other wagon the sweat streaming from his face as his broad shoulders swung down with the empty fork and up with a great mat of hay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they worked alternately in the fields and at the barns until halfpast eleven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they went into the shade at the edge of the meadow and had their dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my old woman said gabbard says that two setdown meals a day in harvest times as many as shell stand for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we have dinner out here in good weather and to the barn when it rains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the talk was of weather prospects of probable tonnage to the acre of the outlook for the corn of the health and family expectations of the mares and the cows and the pigs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it died away gradually as one man after another stretched out upon his back with a bunch of hay for an odorous pillow and his broadbrimmed straw hat for a lightshade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarborough was the fourth man to yield as he dozed off his hat was hiding that smile of boundless content which comes only to him who stretches his well body upon grass or soft stubble and feels the vigor of the earth steal up and through him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont i do this oftener <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mustand i shall now that my minds more at ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a long afternoon of the toil that tires and vexes not and at sundown he was glad to ride home on top of the last wagon instead of walking as he had intended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the suppertable was readywas spread in the diningshed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they washed their hands and sunburnt arms and soused their heads in cold water from the well and sat scarborough at one end gabbard at the other the strapping sons and the hands down either side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole meal was before themhuge platters of fried chicken great dishes full of beans and corn and potatoes plates piled high with hot corn bread other plates of saltrising mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabbards miraculous apple pies and honey for which the plundered flowers might still be mourning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesterday it would have seemed to scarborough dinner enough for a regiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> todayhe thought he could probably eat it all and wished that he might try <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to drink there were coffee and cider and two kinds of milk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried the buttermilk and kept on with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must a had a busy summer said gabbard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the first time youve been with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did hope to get here for the threshing but i couldnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the threshing set them all offit had been a record year thirtyeight bushels to the acre on the average twentyseven on the hillsides which gabbard had hesitated whether to put in or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an hour after supper scarborough could no longer hold his eyes open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wake me with the others he said to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gabbard who was making up the saltrising yeast for the morrows baking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill have breakfast when they do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon youve earned it said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eph says you laid it over em all today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i guess i at least earned my supper replied scarborough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i guess i ate it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt do so bad considerin mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothin like livin in town to take appetite away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that isnt all it takes away said scarborough going on to his own part of the house without explaining his remark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his head touched the pillow his brain instantly stopped the machinery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he needed no croonings or dronings from the fields to soothe him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not an idea in my head all day he said to himself with drowsy delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four days of this and on the fifth came the outside world in the form of burdick chairman of the county committee of his party in the county in which his farm lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sat on the fence under the big maple out of earshot of the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> larkins come out for john frankfort for the nomination for governor said burdick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even larkin couldnt get it for frankforthes too notorious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dont want to get it for him replied burdick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarborough stopped fanning himself with his widebrimmed straw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge graney was the most adroit and dangerous of john dumonts tools <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had given invaluable aid from the bench at several of the national woolens companys most critical moments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet he had retained and increased his popularity and his reputation by deciding against his secret master with a brave show of virtue when he knew the higher courts must reverse him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for several years scarborough had been looking forward to the inevitable open conflict between the forces of honesty in his party and the forces of the machine as ruled by the halfdozen big corporations who also ruled the machine of the opposition party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had known that the contest must come and that he must take part in it and he had been getting ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had not wished to give battle until he was strong enough to give a battle which even if he lost it would not strengthen the hold of the corruptionists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after he rejected larkins dazzling offers conditioned upon his aloofness rather than frank subservience he had thought the whole situation over and as he hinted to pauline had realized how apparently hopeless a fight against the machine would be just then with the people prosperous and therefore quiescent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he had decided to stand aside for the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he now saw that reluctance to attack dumont had been at least a factor in this decision and he also saw that he could not delay as he had hoped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no escapeeither he must let his work of years be undermined and destroyed or he must give battle with all his strength and skill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remembered what pauline had said you cant lose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one cant lose in this sort of fight he thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either we win or therell be no victory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sprang from the fence to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets go to the house he said to burdick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked burdick as they walked toward the gate where his horse and buggy were hitched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fight larkin and his gang in the open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill get exgovernor bowen to let us use his name and canvass the state for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll split the party then the partyll turn and split you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and later as they were separating scarborough to drive to saint x burdick to go back to marshaltown he said ill help all i can in a quiet way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buti hope youve got your cyclone cellar dug <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent been digging a cyclone cellar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been trying to manufacture a cyclone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were thirtythree clear days before the meeting of the convention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wasted not an hour of them on the manufacturing towns he went to the countryto the farmers and the villagers the men who lived each man in his own house on his own soil from which he earned his own living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up and down and across the state he went speaking organizing planning inspiringhe and the coterie of young men who looked up to him as their leader and followed him in this desperate assault as courageously as if victory were assured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not long before the convention he paused at exjudge bowens country place and spent two hours with him in his great quiet cool library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isnt it inspiring scarborough said to see so many young men in arms for a principle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man slowly shook his magnificent white head and smiled at the young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> principles without leaders go begging he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men rally to the standard only when the right voice calls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the right voice at the right time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laid his hand on scarboroughs shoulder with affection and pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the moment should come for you to think of it do not forget that the leader is the principle and that in this fight the leader is not ibut you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> larkin decided that the state convention should be held at saint x because his machine was most perfect there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the national woolens company the consolidated pipe and wire company and the indiana oil and gas corporationthe three principal political corporations in the statehad their main plants there and were in complete political control <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while larkin had no fear of the scarborough movement regarding it as a sentimental outburst in the rank and file of the party that would die away when its fomenter had been read out of the party at the convention by the regular organization still he had been in the game too long to take unnecessary chances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt that it would be wise to have the delegates assemble where all the surroundings would be favorable and where his ablest and confidential men could do their work in peace and quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the convention was to meet on the last thursday in september <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the preceding monday morning culverdumonts small thin stealthy private secretaryarrived at saint x and after making an appointment with merriweather for halfpast twelve went out to the eyrie to go through a lot of accumulated domestic business with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she in a most formal and unencouraging manner invited him to stop there he eagerly accepted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you so much he said effusively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be perfectly frank ive been tempted to invite myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have some valuables with me that i dont feel at all easy about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i should be robbed it would be a very serious matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would it be asking too much of you to ask you to put a package in your jewel safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be glad to do it for you replied pauline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres plenty of roomthe safes almost empty and its ridiculously large <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my package isnt small said culver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and on my mind it weighs tons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reached into his large bagat sight of it pauline had wondered why he had brought such a bag up from the hotel when his papers for her inspection were so few <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lifted out an oblong bulky package <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youll just touch that button said she james will come and show you how to get to the safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he said im making a nuisance of myself mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont but would you mind going to the safe with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id much rather none of the servants knew about this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pauline smiled and bade him follow her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went to her private sittingroom and she showed him the safe in a small closet built into the lower part of the bookcase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked culver as he put the package away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see that you dont lock this door often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how fortunate you spoke of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the combination is on a bit of paper in one of the little drawers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> culver found it in the first drawer he opened and handed it to her without looking at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mustnt let me know it said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill just fix the time lock so that it wont interfere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he had done so he closed the safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he left he said i shall only bother you to let me sleep in the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be very busy all day each day im here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she thought he had gone he returned to add perhaps id better explain to you that theres fortyfive thousand dollars in cash in the package <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why i was so anxious for no one to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill say nothing about it pauline assured him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> larkin came down from indianapolis the next day and registered at the palace hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as he could escape from the politicians and newspaper correspondents in the hotel office he went by a devious route to a room on the floor below his own and knocking was admitted to culver and merriweather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he nodded to dumonts political agent then said to culver youve got the dough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes culver answered in his best imitation of the tone of the man of large affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope mighty few hundreds said larkin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys are kind o shy about changing hundreddollar bills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to attract attention to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had large dreamy almost sentimental brown eyes that absurdly misrepresented his character or at least his dominant characteristics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his long slightly bent nose and sharp chin and thin tight mouth were more truthful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dumont asked me to telegraph him after id talked with you said culver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must say hes raised a darn sight more hell than i thought he would larkin answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people seem to be in a nasty mood about corruption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darn their fool souls as if they wouldnt be in the rottenest kind of a fix with no property and no jobs if we didnt keep the ignorant vote under control and head off such firebrands as this fellow scarborough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> demanded merriweather who had listened to this tirade with an expression suggesting cynicism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought and he knew joe larkin thought politics a mere game of chanceyou won or you didnt win and principles and oratory and likes and dislikes and resentments were so much hot air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the oil can had been with scarborough merriweather would have served him as cheerfully and as loyally aswell as would joe larkin in those circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> larkin wrenched a big bunch of letters and papers from the sagged inside pocket of his slouchy sack coat after some fumbling and sorting he paused upon the back of a dirty envelope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres how the convention stands to a man he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure two hundred and sixtysevenby sure i mean the fellows we own outright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> safe two hundred and fortyfiveby safe i mean those thatll stand by the organization thick and thin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> insurgents two hundred and ninetyfivethose are the chaps thatve gone clean crazy with scarborough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtful three hundred and eightysixsome of em can be bought most of em are waiting to see which way the cat jumps so as to jump with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then weve got five hundred and twelve and it takes five hundred and ninetyseven to elect said merriweather the instant the last word was out of larkins mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> merriweather was a mite of a man could hardly have weighed more than a hundred pounds had a bulging forehead was bald and gray at the temples eyes brown as walnut juice and quick and keen as a ratterriers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his expression was the gamblerscalm watchful indifferent pallid as from years of nights under the gaslight in close hot rooms with the cards sliding from the faro box hour after hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with a look at culver and some of emll come mighty high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where are you going to do business with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right here in this room where ive done it manys the time before replied larkin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow night conkey sedgwick and my boy tomll begin steerin em in one at a time about eight oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then ill turn the money over to you at seven tomorrow night said culver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got it in a safe place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not one of the banks i hope said merriweather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we noted your suggestions on that point and on all the others culver answered with gracious condescension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why i brought cash in small denominations and didnt go near anybody with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got to get to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see you here tomorrow night at seven mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess itll be judge graney on the third ballot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the first ballot the organizationll vote solid for graney and my fellowsll vote for john frankfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the second ballot half my frankfort crowdll switch over to graney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the third ill put the rest of em over and thatll be enough to electprobably the scarborough crowdll see its no use and let us make it unanimous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the losers are always hot for harmony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertha remained where he had left her lost in meditation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gaiety had vanished from her downcast face and it was very sad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three or four times she shook her head as if bewailing some remembrance or some loss but her sorrowful reflections found no vent in words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not until caleb had been occupied some time in yoking a team of horses to a waggon by the summary process of nailing the harness to the vital parts of their bodies that she drew near to father i am lonely in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want my eyes my patient here they are said caleb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are more yours than mine bertha any hour in the fourandtwenty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what shall its much the same as usual said caleb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gay colours on the walls the bright flowers on the plates and dishes the shining wood where there are beams or panels the general cheerfulness and neatness of the building make it very cheerful and neat it was wherever berthas hands could busy themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but nowhere else were cheerfulness and neatness possible in the old crazy shed which calebs fancy so transformed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have your working dress on and are not so gallant as when you wear the handsome coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father said the blind girl drawing close to his side and stealing one arm round his neck tell me something about may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she she is indeed said caleb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite a rare thing to caleb not to have to draw on his invention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her hair is dark said bertha pensively darker than mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her voice is sweet and musical i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have often loved to hear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres not a dolls in all the room to equal it said caleb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped for bertha had drawn closer round his neck and from the arm that clung about him came a warning pressure which he understood too well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he coughed a moment hammered for a moment and then fell back upon the song about the sparkling bowl his infallible resource in all such difficulties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am never tired you know of hearing about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with such fervency that caleb though his motives were so pure could not endure to meet her face but dropped his eyes as if she could have read in them his innocent deceit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tell me again about him dear father said bertha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face is benevolent kind and tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> honest and true i am sure it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the manly heart that tries to cloak all favours with a show of roughness and unwillingness beats in its and makes it noble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> added caleb in his quiet desperation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is older than may yees said caleb reluctantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a little older than may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be his patient companion in infirmity and age to be his gentle nurse in sickness and his constant friend in suffering and sorrow to know no weariness in working for his sake to watch him tend him sit beside his bed and talk to him awake and pray for him asleep what privileges these would be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what opportunities for proving all her truth and devotion to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would she do all this dear father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt of it said caleb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i love her father i can love her from my soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and saying so she laid her poor blind face on calebs shoulder and so wept and wept that he was almost sorry to have brought that tearful happiness upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the mean time there had been a pretty sharp commotion at john peerybingles for little mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peerybingle naturally couldnt think of going anywhere without the baby and to get the baby under weigh took time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that there was much of the baby speaking of it as a thing of weight and measure but there was a vast deal to do about and about it and it all had to be done by easy stages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance when the baby was got by hook and by crook to a certain point of dressing and you might have rationally supposed that another touch or two would finish him off and turn him out a tip top baby challenging the world he was unexpectedly extinguished in a flannel cap and hustled off to bed where he simmered so to speak between two blankets for the best part of an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from this state of inaction he was then recalled shining very much and roaring violently to partake of well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would rather say if youll permit me to speak generally of a slight repast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after which he went to sleep again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peerybingle took advantage of this interval to make herself as smart in a small way as ever you saw anybody in all your life and during the same short truce miss slowboy insinuated herself into a spencer of a fashion so surprising and ingenious that it had no connection with herself or anything else in the universe but was a shrunken dogseared independent fact pursuing its lonely course without the least regard to anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time the baby being all alive again was invested by the united efforts of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peerybingle and miss slowboy with a creamcoloured mantle for its body and a sort of nankeen raisedpie for its head and so in course of time they all three got down to the door where the old horse had already taken more than the full value of his days toll out of the turnpike trust by tearing up the road with his impatient autographs and whence boxer might be dimly seen in the remote perspective standing looking back and tempting him to come on without orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to a chair or anything of that kind for helping mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peerybingle into the cart you know very little of john if you think that was necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before you could have seen him lift her from the ground there she was in her place fresh and rosy if i might be allowed to mention a young ladys legs on any terms i would observe of miss slowboys that there was a fatality about them which rendered them singularly liable to be grazed and that she never effected the smallest ascent or descent without recording the circumstance upon them with a notch as robinson crusoe marked the days upon his wooden calendar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as this might be considered ungenteel ill think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got the basket with the veal and hampie and things and the bottles of beer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you havent you must turn youre a nice little article returned the carrier to be talking about turning round after keeping me a full quarter of an i am sorry for it john said dot in a great bustle but i really could not think of going to berthas i would not do it john on any account without the veal and hampie and things and this monosyllable was addressed to the horse who didnt mind it at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll be time enough to do that returned john when i begin to what a hardhearted monster you must be john not to have said so at once and save me such a turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i declared i wouldnt go to berthas without the veal and hampie and things and the bottles of beer for any money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> regularly once a fortnight ever since we have been married john have we made our little picnic there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anything was to go wrong with it i should almost think we were it was a kind thought in the first instance said the carrier my dear john replied dot turning very red dont talk about again so visibly and instantly embarrassed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes an odd fish said the carrier looking straight along the road before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe theres yes said the carrier with his eyes attracted to her face by the great earnestness of her manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am glad you feel so certain of it because its a confirmation to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its curious that he should have taken it into his head to ask leave to go on lodging with us so very strangely she rejoined in a low voice scarcely audible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however hes a goodnatured old gentleman said john and pays as a gentleman and i think his word is to be relied upon like a gentlemans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had quite a long talk with him this morning he can hear me better already he says as he gets more used to my voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told me a great deal about himself and i told him a great deal about myself and a rare lot of questions he asked me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave him information about my having two beats you know in my business one day to the right from our house and back again another day to the left from our house and back again for hes a stranger and dont know the names of places about here and he seemed quite pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why then i shall be returning home to night your way he says when i thought youd be coming in an exactly opposite direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may trouble you for another lift perhaps but ill engage not to fall so sound asleep again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was afraid from the look of your face that i had gone rambling on so long as to set you thinking about something else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was very near it ill dot making no reply they jogged on for some little time in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was not easy to remain silent very long in john peerybingles cart for everybody on the road had something to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though it might only be how are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and indeed it was very often nothing else still to give that back again in the right spirit of cordiality required not merely a nod and a smile but as wholesome an action of the lungs withal as a longwinded parliamentary speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes passengers on foot or horseback plodded on a little way beside the cart for the express purpose of having a chat and then there was a great deal to be said on both sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then boxer gave occasion to more goodnatured recognitions of and by the carrier than halfadozen christians could have done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody knew him all along the road especially the fowls and pigs who when they saw him approaching with his body all on one side and his ears pricked up inquisitively and that knob of a tail making the most of itself in the air immediately withdrew into remote back settlements without waiting for the honour of a nearer acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had business everywhere going down all the turnings looking into all the wells bolting in and out of all the cottages dashing into the midst of all the dameschools fluttering all the pigeons magnifying the tails of all the cats and trotting into the publichouses like a regular customer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherever he went somebody or other might have been heard to cry halloa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and out came that somebody forthwith accompanied by at least two or three other somebodies to give john peerybingle and his pretty wife good day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the packages and parcels for the errand cart were numerous and there were many stoppages to take them in and give them out which were not by any means the worst parts of the journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some people were so full of expectation about their parcels and other people were so full of wonder about their parcels and other people were so full of inexhaustible directions about their parcels and john had such a lively interest in all the parcels that it was as good as a play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> likewise there were articles to carry which required to be considered and discussed and in reference to the adjustment and disposition of which councils had to be holden by the carrier and the senders at which boxer usually assisted in short fits of the closest attention and long fits of tearing round and round the assembled sages and barking himself hoarse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all these little incidents dot was the amused and openeyed spectatress from her chair in the cart and as she sat there looking on a charming little portrait framed to admiration by the tilt there was no lack of nudgings and glancings and whisperings and envyings among the younger men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this delighted john the carrier beyond measure for he was proud to have his little wife admired knowing that she didnt mind it that if anything she rather liked it perhaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trip was a little foggy to be sure in the january weather and was raw and cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but who cared for such trifles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not tilly slowboy for she deemed sitting in a cart on any terms to be the highest point of human joys the crowning circumstance of earthly hopes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the baby ill be sworn for its not in baby nature to be warmer or more sound asleep though its capacity is great in both respects than that blessed young peerybingle was all the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you couldnt see very far in the fog of course but you could see a great deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its astonishing how much you may see in a thicker fog than that if you will only take the trouble to look for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why even to sit watching for the fairyrings in the fields and for the patches of hoarfrost still lingering in the shade near hedges and by trees was a pleasant occupation to make no mention of the unexpected shapes in which the trees themselves came starting out of the mist and glided into it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hedges were tangled and bare and waved a multitude of blighted garlands in the wind but there was no discouragement in this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was agreeable to contemplate for it made the fireside warmer in possession and the summer greener in expectancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the river looked chilly but it was in motion and moving at a good pace which was a great point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the canal was rather slow and torpid that must be admitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would freeze the sooner when the frost set fairly in and then there would be skating and sliding and the heavy old barges frozen up somewhere near a wharf would smoke their rusty iron chimney pipes all day and have a lazy time of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one place there was a great mound of weeds or stubble burning and they watched the fire so white in the daytime flaring through the fog with only here and there a dash of red in it until in consequence as she observed of the smoke getting up her nose miss slowboy choked she could do anything of that sort on the smallest provocation and woke the baby who wouldnt go to sleep again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but boxer who was in advance some quarter of a mile or so had already passed the outposts of the town and gained the corner of the street where caleb and his daughter lived and long before they had reached the door he and the blind girl were on the pavement waiting to receive them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boxer by the way made certain delicate distinctions of his own in his communication with bertha which persuade me fully that he knew her to be blind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never sought to attract her attention by looking at her as he often did with other people but touched her invariably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what experience he could ever have had of blind people or blind dogs i dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had never lived with a blind master nor had mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boxer nor any of his respectable family on either side ever been visited with blindness that i am aware of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may have found it out for himself perhaps but he had got hold of it somehow and therefore he had hold of bertha too by the skirt and kept bold until mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peerybingle and the baby and miss slowboy and the basket were all got safely within doors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may fielding was already come and so was her mother a little querulous chip of an old lady with a peevish face who in right of having preserved a waist like a bedpost was supposed to be a most transcendent figure and who in consequence of having once been better off or of labouring under an impression that she might have been if something had happened which never did happen and seemed to have never been particularly likely to come to pass but its all the same was very genteel and patronising indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gruff and tackleton was also there doing the agreeable with the evident sensation of being as perfectly at home and as unquestionably in his own element as a fresh young salmon on the top of the great pyramid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried dot running up to meet her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her old friend was to the full as hearty and as glad as she and it really was if youll believe me quite a pleasant sight to see them embrace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know sometimes when you are used to a pretty face how when it comes into contact and comparison with another pretty face it seems for the moment to be homely and faded and hardly to deserve the high opinion you have had of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this was not at all the case either with dot or may for mays face set off dots and dots face set off mays so naturally and agreeably that as john peerybingle was very near saying when he came into the room they ought to have been born sisters which was the only improvement you could have suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton had brought his leg of mutton and wonderful to relate a tart besides but we dont mind a little dissipation when our brides are in the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont get married every day and in addition to these dainties there were the veal and hampie and things as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peerybingle called them which were chiefly nuts and oranges and cakes and such small deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the repast was set forth on the board flanked by calebs contribution which was a great wooden bowl of smoking potatoes he was prohibited by solemn compact from producing any other viands tackleton led his intended motherinlaw to the post of honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the better gracing of this place at the high festival the majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but let us be genteel or die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caleb sat next his daughter dot and her old schoolfellow were side by side the good carrier took care of the bottom of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss slowboy was isolated for the time being from every article of furniture but the chair she sat on that she might have nothing else to knock the babys head against <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as tilly stared about her at the dolls and toys they stared at her and at the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the venerable old gentlemen at the street doors who were all in full action showed especial interest in the party pausing occasionally before leaping as if they were listening to the conversation and then plunging wildly over and over a great many times without halting for breath as in a frantic state of delight with the whole proceedings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly if these old gentlemen were inclined to have a fiendish joy in the contemplation of tackletons discomfiture they had good reason to be satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton couldnt get on at all and the more cheerful his intended bride became in dots society the less he liked it though he had brought them together for that purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he was a regular dog in the manger was tackleton and when they laughed and he couldnt he took it into his head immediately that they must be laughing at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to talk of those why you ant particularly old at any time are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at my sober plodding husband there returned dot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many youll add to mays i am sure i dont know said dot laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she cant be much less than a hundred years of age ha ha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hollow as a drum that laugh though <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he looked as if he could have twisted dots neck comfortably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only to remember how we used to talk at school about the husbands we would choose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how young and how handsome and how gay and how lively mine was not to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know whether to laugh may seemed to know which to do for the colour flushed into her face and tears stood in her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the very persons themselves real live young men were fixed on sometimes said dot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we little thought how things would come about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never fixed on john im sure i never so much as thought of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i had told you you were ever to be married though may didnt say yes she certainly didnt say no or express no by any means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton laughed quite shouted he laughed so loud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john peerybingle laughed too in his ordinary goodnatured and contented manner but his was a mere whisper of a laugh to tackletons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you couldnt help yourselves for all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you couldnt resist some of them are dead said dot and some of them forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of them if they could stand among us at this moment would not believe we were the same creatures would not believe that what they saw and heard was real and we could forget them so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they she had spoken with such earnestness and fire that she stood in need of some recalling to herself without doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her husbands cheek was very gentle for he merely interfered as he supposed to shield old tackleton but it proved effectual for she stopped and said no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an uncommon agitation even in her silence which the wary tackleton who had brought his halfshut eye to bear upon her noted closely and remembered to some purpose too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may uttered no word good or bad but sat quite still with her eyes cast down and made no sign of interest in what had passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the good lady her mother now interposed observing in the first instance that girls were girls and byegones byegones and that so long as young people were young and thoughtless they would probably conduct themselves like young and thoughtless persons with two or three other positions of a no less sound and incontrovertible character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then remarked in a devout spirit that she thanked heaven she had always found in her daughter may a dutiful and obedient child for which she took no credit to herself though she had every reason to believe it was entirely owing to herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton she said that he was in a moral point of view an undeniable individual and that he was in an eligible point of view a soninlaw to be desired no one in their senses could doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with regard to the family into which he was so soon about after some solicitation to be admitted she believed mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton knew that although reduced in purse it had some pretensions to gentility and if certain circumstances not wholly unconnected she would go so far as to say with the indigo trade but to which she would not more particularly refer had happened differently it might perhaps have been in possession of wealth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then remarked that she would not allude to the past and would not mention that her daughter had for some time rejected the suit of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton and that she would not say a great many other things which she did say at great length <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally she delivered it as the general result of her observation and experience that those marriages in which there was least of what was romantically and sillily called love were always the happiest and that she anticipated the greatest possible amount of bliss not rapturous bliss but the solid steadygoing article from the approaching nuptials <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she concluded by informing the company that tomorrow was the day she had lived for expressly and that when it was over she would desire nothing better than to be packed up and disposed of in any genteel place of burial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as these remarks were quite unanswerable which is the happy property of all remarks that are sufficiently wide of the purpose they changed the current of the conversation and diverted the general attention to the veal and hampie the cold mutton the potatoes and the tart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in order that the bottled beer might not be slighted john peerybingle proposed tomorrow the weddingday and called upon them to drink a bumper to it before he proceeded on his journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for you ought to know that he only rested there and gave the old horse a bait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had to go some four of five miles farther on and when he returned in the evening he called for dot and took another rest on his way home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the order of the day on all the picnic occasions had been ever since their institution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were two persons present besides the bride and bridegroom elect who did but indifferent honour to the toast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these was dot too flushed and discomposed to adapt herself to any small occurrence of the moment the other bertha who rose up hurriedly before the rest and left the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said stout john peerybingle pulling on his dreadnought good bye john returned caleb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to say it by rote and to wave his hand in the same unconscious manner for he stood observing bertha with an anxious wondering face that never altered its expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the jolly carrier bending down to kiss the child which tilly slowboy now intent upon her knife and fork had deposited asleep and strange to say without damage in a little cot of berthas furnishing good bye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time will come i suppose when youll turn out into the cold my little friend and leave your old father to enjoy his pipe and his rheumatics in the im here john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returned the carrier clapping his sounding hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was such a wonder ever heard of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was not so soon done either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it lay in the usual place the carriers dreadnought pocket with the little pouch her own work from which she was used to fill it but her hand shook so that she entangled it and yet her hand was small enough to have come out easily i am sure and bungled terribly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the filling of the pipe and lighting it those little offices in which i have commended her discretion were vilely done from first to last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the whole process tackleton stood looking on maliciously with the halfclosed eye which whenever it met hers or caught it for it can hardly be said to have ever met another eye rather being a kind of trap to snatch it up augmented her confusion in a most remarkable degree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why what a clumsy dot you are this afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i with these goodnatured words he strode away and presently was heard in company with boxer and the old horse and the cart making lively music down the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what time the dreamy caleb still stood watching his blind daughter with the same expression on his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how changed you are my darling in a few hours since this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the blind girl bursting into tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caleb drew his hand across his eyes before he answered her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but think how cheerful and how happy you have been bertha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how that strikes me to the heart dear father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> always so mindful of caleb was very much perplexed to understand her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be to be blind bertha my poor dear he faltered is a i have never felt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never felt it in its fulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have sometimes wished that i could see you or could see him only once dear father only for one little minute that i might know what it is i treasure up she laid her hands upon her breast and hold here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i might be sure and have it right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and sometimes but then i was a child i have wept in my prayers at night to think that when your images ascended from my heart to heaven they might not be the true resemblance of yourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have never had these feelings and they will again said caleb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh my good gentle father bear with me if i am wicked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is not the sorrow that so her father could not choose but let his moist eyes overflow she was so earnest and pathetic but he did not understand her yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bring her to me said bertha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot hold it closed and shut may heard the mention of her name and coming quietly towards her touched her on the arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blind girl turned immediately and held her by both hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look into my face dear heart sweet heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> read it with your beautiful eyes and tell me if the truth is written on the blind girl still upturning the blank sightless face down there is not in my soul a wish or thought that is not for your good bright may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is not in my soul a grateful recollection stronger than the deep remembrance which is stored there of the many many times when in the full pride of sight and beauty you have had consideration for blind bertha even when we two were children or when bertha was as much a child as ever blindness can be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the less my dear may and she drew towards her in a closer grasp not the less my bird because today the knowledge that you are to be his wife has wrung my heart almost to breaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh forgive me that it is so for the sake of all he has done to relieve the weariness of my dark life and for the sake of the belief you have in me when i call heaven to witness that i could not wish him married to a wife more while speaking she had released may fieldings hands and clasped her garments in an attitude of mingled supplication and love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sinking lower and lower down as she proceeded in her strange confession she dropped at last at the feet of her friend and hid her blind face in the folds of her dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed her father smitten at one blow with the truth have i deceived her from the cradle but to break her heart it was well for all of them that dot that beaming useful busy little dot for such she was whatever faults she had and however you may learn to hate her in good time it was well for all of them i say that she was there or where this would have ended it were hard to tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dot recovering her selfpossession interposed before may could reply or caleb say another word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how composed she is you see already and how good it is of her to mind us said the cheery little woman kissing her upon the forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a noble little dot in such things and it must have been an obdurate nature that could have withstood her influence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had got poor caleb and his bertha away that they might comfort and console each other as she knew they only could she presently came bouncing back the saying is as fresh as any daisy i say fresher to mount guard over that bridling little piece of consequence in the cap and gloves and prevent the dear old creature from making discoveries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so bring me the precious baby tilly said she drawing a chair to the fire and while i have it in my lap heres mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fielding tilly will tell me all about the management of babies and put me right in twenty points where im as wrong as can be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wont you not even the welsh giant who according to the popular expression was so slow as to perform a fatal surgical operation upon himself in emulation of a jugglingtrick achieved by his arch enemy at breakfasttime not even he fell half so readily into the snare prepared for him as the old lady did into this artful pitfall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact of tackleton having walked out and furthermore of two or three people having been talking together at a distance for two minutes leaving her to her own resources was quite enough to have put her on her dignity and the bewailment of that mysterious convulsion in the indigo trade for fourandtwenty hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this becoming deference to her experience on the part of the young mother was so irresistible that after a short affectation of humility she began to enlighten her with the best grace in the world and sitting bolt upright before the wicked dot she did in half an hour deliver more infallible domestic recipes and precepts than would if acted on have utterly destroyed and done up that young peerybingle though he had been an infant samson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to change the theme dot did a little needlework she carried the contents of a whole workbox in her pocket however she contrived it i dont know then did a little nursing then a little more needlework then had a little whispering chat with may while the old lady dozed and so in little bits of bustle which was quite her manner always found it a very short afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as it grew dark and as it was a solemn part of this institution of the picnic that she should perform all berthas household tasks she trimmed the fire and swept the hearth and set the teaboard out and drew the curtain and lighted a candle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she played an air or two on a rude kind of harp which caleb had contrived for bertha and played them very well for nature had made her delicate little ear as choice a one for music as it would have been for jewels if she had had any to wear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time it was the established hour for having tea and tackleton came back again to share the meal and spend the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caleb and bertha had returned some time before and caleb had sat down to his afternoons work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he couldnt settle to it poor fellow being anxious and remorseful for his daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was touching to see him sitting idle on his workingstool regarding her so wistfully and always saying in his face have i deceived when it was night and tea was done and dot had nothing more to do in washing up the cups and saucers in a word for i must come to it and there is no use in putting it off when the time drew nigh for expecting the carriers return in every sound of distant wheels her manner changed again her colour came and went and she was very restless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not as good wives are when listening for their husbands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was another sort of restlessness from that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gradual approach of all the sounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scratching paw of boxer at the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returned the carrier standing in the portal with his brown face ruddy as a winter berry from the keen night air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is not to be deceived observed the carrier laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then every man in the regiment creole and backwoodsman lay back to laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answer of the garrison was a defiant cheer and those who had dropped finding they were not shot at picked themselves up again and gained the top helping to pull the ladders after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bowmans men swung back into place the rattle and drag were heard in the blockhouse as the cannon were run out through the ports and the battle which had held through the night watches began again with redoubled vigor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was more caution on the side of the british for they had learned dearly how the kentuckians could measure crack and crevice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there followed two hours and a futile waste of ammunition the lead from the garrison flying harmless here and there and not a patch of skin or cloth showing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i am obliged to storm you may depend upon such treatment as is justly due to a murderer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beware of destroying stores of any kind or any papers or letters that are in your possession or of hurting one house in the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you do there shall be no mercy shown you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so read colonel clark as he stood before the log fire in monsieur boutons house at the back of the town the captains grouped in front of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to raise his hair said captain charleville <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon the boys will see to that said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel clark folded the letter addressed it and turned gravely to monsieur bouton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will oblige me sir said he by taking this to governor hamilton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will be provided with a flag of monsieur bouton was a round little man as his name suggested and the men cheered him as he strode soberly up the street a piece of sheeting tied to a sapling and flung over his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through such humble agencies are the ends of providence accomplished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur bouton walked up to the gate disappeared sidewise through the postern and we sat down to breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a very short time monsieur bouton was seen coming back and his face was not so impassive that the governors message could not be read thereon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis not a loveletter he has ill warrant said terence as the little man disappeared into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so accurately had monsieur boutons face betrayed the news that the men went back to their posts without orders some with half a breakfast in hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and soon the rank and file had the message <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lieutenantgovernor hamilton begs leave to acquaint colonel clark that he and his garrison are not disposed to be our men had eaten their enemy was within their grasp and clark and all his officers could scarce keep them from storming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such was the deadliness of their aim that scarce a shot came back and time and again i saw men fling themselves in front of the breastworks with a war whoop wave their rifles in the air and cry out that they would have the har buyers sculp before night should fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not tuned to the nicer courtesies of warfare the memory of hamiltons war parties of blackened homes of families dead and missing raged unappeased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were not content to leave vengeance in the lords hands and when a white flag peeped timorously above the gate a great yell of derision went up from river bank to riverbank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of the poster n stepped the officer with the faded scarlet coat and in due time went back again haughtily his head high casting contempt right and left of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again the postern opened and this time there was a cheer at sight of a man in hunting shirt and leggings and coonskin cap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after him came a certain major hay indianenticer of detested memory the lieutenant of him who followedthe hair buyer himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a murmur of hatred arose from the men stationed there and many would have shot him where he stood but for clark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the devil has the grit said cowan though his eyes blazed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lieutenantgovernor hamilton stared indifferently at the glowering backwoodsmen as he walked the few steps to the church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was colonel clark waiting at the door through which the good creoles had been wont to go to worship bowing somewhat ironically to the british general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a strange meeting they had in st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> xaviers by the light of the candles on the altar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hot words passed in that house of peace the general demanding protection for all his men and our colonel replying that he would do with the indian partisans as he chose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and whom mean you by indian partisans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i take major hay to be one of them our colonel had answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was soon a matter of common report how clark had gazed fixedly at the major when he said this and how the major turned pale and trembled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with our own eyes we saw them coming out major hay as near to staggering as a man could be the governor blushing red for shame of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they went sorrowfully back to the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel clark stood at the steps of the church looking after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i we who stood by the church had indeed heard firing in the direction of the hills east of the town and had wondered thereat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perceiving a crowd gathered at the far end of the street we all ran thither save the colonel who directed to have the offenders brought to him at monsieur boutons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a party of canadians and indians had just returned from the falls of the ohio with scalps they had taken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain williams had gone out with his company to meet them had lured them on and finally had killed a number and was returning with the prisoners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> williams himself walked ahead with two dishevelled and frightened coureurs du bois twoscore at least of the townspeople of vincennes friends and relatives of the prisoners pressing about and crying out to williams to have mercy on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for williams he took them in to the colonel the towns people pressing into the dooryard and banking in front of it on the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind all a tragedy impended nor can i think of it now without sickening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the frightened creoles in the street gave back against the fence and from behind them issuing as a stormcloud came the half of williams company yelling like madmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pushed and jostled ahead of them were four indians decked and feathered the halfdried scalps dangling from their belts impassive true to their creed despite the indignity of jolts and jars and blows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on and on pressed the mob gathering recruits at every corner and when they reached st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> xaviers before the fort half the regiment was there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> others watched too from the stockade and what they saw made their knees smite together with fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here were four bronzed statues in a row across the street the space in front of them clear that their partisans in the fort might look and consider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was passing in the savage mind no man might know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a lip trembled nor an eye faltered when a backwoodsman his memory aflame at sight of the pitiful white scalps on their belts thrust through the crowd to curse them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fletcher blount frenzied snatched his tomahawk from his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried with a great oath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well pay the har buyer in his own coin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> call the garrison he had raised his arm and turned to strike when the savage put up his hand not in entreaty but as one man demanding a right from another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cries the curses the murmurs even were hushed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> throwing back his head arching his chest the notes of a song rose in the heavy air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wild strange notes they were that struck vibrant chords in my own quivering being and the song was the deathsong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay and the lifesong of a soul which had come into the world even as mine own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and somewhere there lay in the song half revealed the awful mystery of that creator whom the soul leaped forth to meet the myriad green of the sun playing with the leaves the fish swimming lazily in the brown pool the doe grazing in the thicket and a naked boy as free from care as these and still the life grows brighter as strength comes and stature and power over man and beast and then god knows what memories of fierce love and fiercer wars and triumphs of desires gained and enemies conqueredgod who has made all lives akin to something which he holds in the hollow of his hand and then the rain beating on the forest crown beating beating beating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the indian knelt in the black mud not at the feet of fletcher blount but on the threshold of the great spirit who ruleth all things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the axe fell yet he uttered no cry as he went before his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the four sang each in turn and died in the sight of some who pitied and some who feared and some who hated for the sake of land and women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the four went beyond the power of gold and gewgaw and were dragged in the mire around the walls and flung into the yellow waters of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the dreary afternoon the men lounged about and cursed the parley and hearkened for the tattoo the signal agreed upon by the leaders to begin the fighting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had been no command against taunts and jeers and they gathered in groups under the walls to indulge themselves and even tried to bribe me as i sat braced against a house with my drum between my knees and the sticks clutched tightly in my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres a spanish dollar for a couple o taps davy shouted jack terrell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on ye pack of rebel cutthroats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yelled a man on the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was answered by a torrent of imprecations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so they flung it back and forth until nightfall when out comes the same fadedscarlet officer holding a letter in his hand and marches down the street to monsieur boutons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there would be no storming now nor any man suffered to lay fingers on the hair buyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember in particular hamilton the hair buyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the fiend my imagination had depicted i have since learned that most villains do not look the part but a man with a great sorrow stamped upon his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun rose on that th of february and the mud melted and one of our companies drew up on each side of the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> downward slid the lion of england the garrison drums beat a dirge and the hair buyer marched out at the head of his motley troops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came my own greatest hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all morning i had been polishing and tightening the drum and my pride was so great as we fell into line that so much as a smile could not be got out of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> picture it all vincennes in black and white by reason of the bright day eaves and gables stockade line and capped towers sharply drawn and straight above these a stark flagstaff waiting for our colors pigs and fowls straying hither and thither unmindful that this day is red on the calendar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is a bit of color toothe villagers on the side streets to see the spectacle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gay wools and gayer handkerchiefs there amid the joyous cheering crowd of thricechanged nationality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the drummer boy stepping proudly behind the colonel himself with a soul lifted high above mire and puddle into the blue above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was laughter amongst the giants behind me and cowan saying softly as when we left kaskaskia go it davy my little gamecock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the whisper of it was repeated among the ranks drawn up by the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes here was the gate and now we were in the fort and an empire was gained never to be lost again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stars and stripes climbed the staff and the folds were caught by an eager breeze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thirteen cannon thundered from the blockhousesone for each colony that had braved a king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there in the miry square within the vincennes fort thin and bronzed and travelstained were the men who had dared the wilderness in ugliest mood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet none by himself would have done iteach had come here compelled by a spirit stronger than his own by a master mind that laughed at the body and its ailments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel george rogers clark stood in the centre of the square under the flag to whose renown he had added three stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straight he was and square and self contained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no weakening tremor of exultation softened his face as he looked upon the men by whose endurance he had been able to do this thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waited until the white smoke of the last gun had drifted away on the breeze until the snapping of the flag and the distant village sounds alone broke the stillness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have not suffered all things for a reward he said but because a righteous cause may grow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and though our names may be forgotten our deeds will be remembered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have conquered a vast land that our children and our childrens children may be freed from tyranny and we have brought a just vengeance upon our enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thank you one and all in the name of the continental congress and of that commonwealth of virginia for which you have fought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are no longer virginians kentuckians kaskaskians and cahokians he paused and we were silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though his words moved us strongly they were beyond us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mention no deeds of heroism of unselfishness of lives saved at the peril of others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am the debtor of every man here for the years to come to see that he and his family have justice from the commonwealth and again he stopped and it seemed to us watching that he smiled a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall name one he said one who never lagged who never complained who starved that the weak might i trembled my teeth chattered as the water had never made them chatter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe i should have fallen but for tom who reached out from the ranks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stumbled forward in a daze to where the colonel stood and the cheering from the ranks was a thing beyond me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the colonels hand on my head brought me to my senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david ritchie he said i give you publicly the the next thing i knew i was on cowans shoulders and he was tearing round and round the fort with two companies at his heels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the divil said terence mccann he dhrummed us over the wather an through the wather and faix he would have dhrummed the sculp from hamiltons head by gar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried antoine le gris now he drum us on out of the gate rushed cowan the frightened villagers scattering right and left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antoine had a friend who lived in this street and in ten minutes there was rum in the colonel clark was sitting alone in the commanding officers room of the garrison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the afternoon sun slanting through the square of the window fell upon the maps and papers before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i halted in sheer embarrassment on the threshold looked up at his face and came on troubled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy he said do you want to go back to i should like to stay to the end colonel i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried bitterly a man of sense measures his force and does not try the impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could as soon march against philadelphia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the end i say and the general must give way to the politician <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and may god have mercy on the politician who will try to keep a peoples affection without money or help from he fell back wearily in his chair while i stood astonished wondering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had thought to find him elated with victory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> congress or virginia said he will have to pay monsieur vigo and father gibault and monsieur gratiot and the other good people who have trusted me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you the congress are far from here i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay he answered too far to care about you and me he ended abruptly and sat for a while staring out of the window at the figures crossing and recrossing the muddy paradeground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom mcchesney goes tonight to kentucky with letters to the county lieutenant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are to go with him and then i shall have no one to remind me when i am hungry and bring me hominy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall have no financier no strategist for a tight place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he smiled a little sadly at my sorrowful look and then drew me to him and patted my shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is no place for a young lad an idle garrison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think he continued presently i think you have a future david if you do not lose your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kentucky will grow and conquer and in twenty years be a thriving community <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and presently you will go to virginia and study law and come back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i would tell you one thing said he with force serve the people as all true men should in a republic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but do not rely upon their gratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will remember a long time he paused looking on me with a significance i did not then understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he spoke again his voice showed no trace of emotion save in the note of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have been a faithful friend davy when i needed loyalty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps the time may come again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodby davy he said and god bless you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stared at me but with kindness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may said he you may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perchance we may i went out from his presence vaguely troubled to find tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and before the early sun had set we were gliding down the wabash in a canoe past places forever dedicated to our agonies towards kentucky and polly ann <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy said tom i reckon shell be standin under the simmon tree waitin fer us with the little shaver in and so she was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eden of one man may be the inferno of his neighbor and now i am to throw to the winds like leaves of a worthless manuscript some years of time and introduce you to a new kentuckya kentucky that was not for the pioneer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one page of this manuscript might have told of a fearful winter when the snow lay in great drifts in the bare woods when tom and i fashioned canoes or noggins out of the great roots when a new and feminine bit of humanity cried in the bark cradle and polly ann sewed deer leather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another pagenay a dozencould be filled with indian horrors ambuscades and massacres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also i might have told how there drifted into this land hitherto unsoiled the refuse cast off by the older colonies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must add quickly that we got more than our share of their best stock along with this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner had the sun begun to pit the snow hillocks than wild creatures came in from the mountains haggard with hunger and hardship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had left their homes in virginia and the carolinas in the autumn an unheralded winter of arctic fierceness had caught them in its grip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bitter tales they told of wives and children buried among the rocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fast on the heels of these wretched ones trooped the spring settlers in droves and i have seen whole churches march singing into the forts the preacher leading and thanking god loudly that he had delivered them from the wilderness and the savage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little forts would not hold them and they went out to hew clearings from the forest and to build cabins and stockades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and our own people starved and snowbound went out likewisetom and polly ann and their little family and myself to the farm at the riverside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and while the water flowed between the stumps over the black land we planted and ploughed and prayed always alert watching north and south against the coming of the indians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and his kind were the scouts the advance guard of civilization not tillers of the soil or lovers of close communities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farther and farther they went afield for game and always they grumbled sorely against this horde which had driven the deer from his cover and the buffalo from his wallow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking back i can recall one evening when the long summer twilight lingered to a close <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom was lounging lazily against the big persimmon tree smoking his pipe the two children digging at the roots and polly ann seated on the doorlog sewing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i drew near she looked up at me from her work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a woman upon whose eternal freshness industry made no mar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy she exclaimed how yeve growed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought yed be a wizened little body but this year yeve shot up my father was six feet two inches in his moccasins i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell be wallopin me soon said tom with a grin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took a long whiff at his pipe and added thoughtfully i reckon this aint no place fer me now with all the something better i answered well put a dam and make our fortune grinding corn for the settlers cried polly ann showing a line of very white teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tom was mildly interested and went with us at daylight to measure the fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he allowed that he would have the more time to hunt if the mill were a success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a month i had had the scheme in my mind where the dam was to be put the race and the wondrous wheel rimmed with cow horns to dip the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and fixed on the wheel there was to be a crank that worked the pounder in the mortar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we were to grind until i could arrange with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarlett the new storekeeper in harrodstown to have two grindingstones fetched across the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the corn ripened and the melons swelled and the flax flowered our axes rang by the rivers side and sometimes as we worked cowan and terrell and mccann and other long hunters would come and jeer good naturedly because we were turning civilized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often they gave us a lift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was september when the millstones arrived and i spent a joyous morning of final bargaining with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarlett was from connecticut had been a quartermaster in the army and at much risk brought ploughs and hardware and scissors and buttons and broadcloth and corduroy across the alleghanies and down the ohio in flatboats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these he sold at great profit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had no money not even the worthless scrip that congress issued but a beaver skin was worth eighteen shillings a bearskin ten and a fox or a deer or a wildcat less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half the village watched the barter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest lounged sullenly about the land court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was just a windowless log house built outside the walls our temple of avarice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the case was this henderson for whose company daniel boone cut the wilderness road believed that he had bought the country and issued grants therefor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom held one of these grants alas and many others whom i knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keen faced speculators bought acre upon acre and tract upon tract from the state and crossed the mountains to extort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the court set in the sunlight in the midst of a fair land held by the shameless thronged day after day by the homeless and the needy jostling quarrelling beseeching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even as i looked upon this strife a man stood beside me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drat em said the stranger as he watched a hawk eyed extortioner in drab for these did not condescend to hunting shirts drat em ef i had my way id wring the i turned with a start and there was mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howdy davy he said yeve growed some sence yeve ben with clark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused and then continued in the same strain tis the same at boonesboro and up thar at the falls settlement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the critters is everywhar robbin men of their claims <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boone earnestly you know that i come into kaintuckee when it warent nothin but wilderness and resked my life time and again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> them varmints is wussn redskinstheyve robbed you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i exclaimed indignant that he of all men should suffer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyve took one claim after another tracts that i staked out long afore they heerd of kaintuckee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rubbed his rifle barrel with his buckskin sleeve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i get a little for my skins and a little by surveyin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when the game goes i reckon where mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy he answered sadly you kin cope with em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they tell me youre buildin a mill up at mcchesneys and i reckon youre as cute as any of em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stood silent for a while our attention caught by a quarrel which had suddenly come out of the doorway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the men was jim willismy friend of clarks campaignwho had a henderson claim near shawanee springs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other was the hawkeyed man of whom mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boone had spoken and fragments of their curses reached us where we stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hunting shirts surged around them alert now at the prospect of a fight men came running in from all directions and shouts of hang him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a common enough spectacle for him and he was not excitable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover he knew that the death of one extortioner more or less would have no effect on the system <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had become as the fowls of the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was acrost the mountain last month said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boone presently and one of them skunks had stole campbells silver spoons at abingdon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> campbell was out arter him for a week with a coil of rope on his saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boone wished me luck in my new enterprise bade me goodby and set out for redstone where he was to measure a tract for a revolutioner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the speculator having been rescued from jim williss clutches by the sheriff the crowd goodnaturedly helped us load our stones between packhorses and some of them followed us all the way home that they might see the grinding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half of mcafees new station had heard the news and came over likewise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from that day we ground as much corn as could be brought to us from miles around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polly ann and i ran the mill and kept the accounts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often of a crisp autumn morning we heard a gobble gobble above the tumbling of the water and found a wild turkey perched on top of the hopper eating his fill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of our meat we got that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for tom he was off and on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the roving spirit seized him he made journeys to the westward with cowan and ray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> generally they returned with packs of skins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but sometimes soberly thanking heaven that their hair was left growing on their heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this and patrolling the wilderness road and other militia duties made up toms life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner was the mill fairly started than off he went to the cumberland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mention this not alone because i remember well the day of his return but because of a certain happening then that had a heavy influence on my after life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the episode deals with an easymannered gentleman named potts who was the agent for a certain major colfax of virginia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom owned under a henderson grant the major had been given this and other lands for his services in the war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> potts arrived one rainy afternoon and found me standing alone under the little leanto that covered the hopper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how we served him with the aid of mccann and cowan and other neighbors and how we were near getting into trouble because of the prank will be seen later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning i rode into harrodstown not wholly easy in my mind concerning the wisdom of the thing i had done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no one to advise me for colonel clark was far away building a fort on the banks of the mississippi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom had laughed at the consequences he cared little about his land and was for moving into the wilderness again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for polly anns sake i wished that we had treated the land agent less cavalierly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was soon distracted from these thoughts by the sight of harrodstown itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no sooner ridden out of the forest shade when i saw that the place was in an uproar men and women gathering in groups and running here and there between the cabins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> urging on the mare i cantered across the fields and the first person i met was james ray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an army of redskins has crossed the ohio and not a man to take command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my god cried ray pointing angrily at the swarms about the land office what trash we have got this last year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kentucky can go to the devil half the stations be wiped out and not a have you sent word to the colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he was here said ray bitterly hed have half of em swinging inside of an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill warrant hed send i rode on into the town potts gone out of my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apart from the landoffice crowds and looking on in silent rage stood a group of the old settlerstall lean powerful yet impotent for lack of a leader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a contrast they were these buckskinclad pioneers to the illassorted humanity they watched absorbed in struggles for the very lands they had won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said jack terrell if the yeath somethings got to be done captain harrod put in gloomily the red varmintsll be on us in another day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the broiling about the land court too was suddenly hushed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men stopped in their tracks staring fixedly at three forms which had come out of the woods into the clearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> redskins they were but not the blanketed kind that drifted every day through the station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their warpaint gleamed in the light and the white edges of the feathered headdresses caught the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one held up in his right hand a white belttoken of peace on the frontier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said fletcher blount be they chickasaws by the headgear said terrell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy nothing loath i put the mare into a gallop and i passed over the very place where polly ann had picked me up and saved my life long since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the indians came on at a dog trot but when they were within fifty paces of me they halted abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chief waved the white belt around his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says he and i trembled from head to foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how well i knew that voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cried and rode up to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank god you are come sir said i for the people here are landmad and the northern indians are crossing the he took my bridle and leading the horse began to walk rapidly towards the station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay he answered i know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a runner came to me with the tidings where i was building a fort on the mississippi and i took willis here and saunders and i glanced at my old friends who grinned at me through the berrystain on their faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we reached a ditch through which the rain of the night before was draining from the fields clark dropped the bridle stooped down and rubbed his face clean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up he got again and flung the feathers from his head and i thought that his eyes twinkled despite the sternness of his look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy my lad said he you and i have seen some strange things together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perchance we shall see stranger a shout went up for he had been recognized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and captain harrod and ray and terrell and cowan who had just ridden in ran up to greet him and press his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called them each by name these men whose loyalty had been proved but said no word more nor paused in his stride until he had reached the edge of the mob about the land court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he stood for a full minute and we who knew him looked on silently and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the turmoil had begun again the speculators calling out in strident tones the settlers bargaining and pushing and all clamoring to be heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while there was money to be made or land to be got they had no ear for the public weal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man shouldered his way through roughly and they gave back cursing surprised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reached the door and flinging those who blocked it right and left entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he was recognized and his name flew from mouth to mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked up to the table strewn with books and deeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was no need they were still for once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this court is closed he cried while kentucky is in danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a deed shall be signed nor an acre granted until i come back from the out they went indeed judge brokers speculators the evicted and the triumphant together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the place was empty clark turned the key and thrust it into his hunting shirt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood for a moment on the step and his eyes swept the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he said there have been many to claim this as i live they cheered him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hands were flung up that were past counting and men who were barely rested from the hardships of the wilderness trail shouted their readiness to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but others slunk away and were found that morning grumbling and cursing the chance that had brought them to kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within the hour the news had spread to the farms and men rode in to harrodstown to tell the colonel of many who were leaving the plough in the furrow and the axe in the wood and starting off across the mountaills in anger and fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the colonel turned to me as he sat writing down the names of the volunteers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy said he when you are grown you shall not stay at home i promise you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take your mare and ride as for your life to mcchesney and tell him to choose ten men and go to the crab orchard on the wilderness road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him for me to turn back every man woman and child i met tom coming in from the field with his rawhide harness over his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polly ann stood calling him in the door and the squirrel broth was steaming on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not wait for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kissing her he flung himself into the saddle i had left and we watched him in the night i found myself sitting up in bed listening to a running and stamping near the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy she whispered the we peered out of the loophole together and through the little orchard we had planted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon flooded the fields and beyond it the forest was a dark blur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can recall the scene now the rude mill standing by the water side the twisted rail fences and the black silhouettes of the horses and cattle as they stood bunched together behind us little tom stirred in his sleep and startled us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that very evening polly ann had frightened him into obedience by telling him that the shawanees would get him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mcafees station was four miles away and rays clearing two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not leave polly ann alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing for it but to wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silently that the children might not be waked and lurking savage might not hear we put the powder and bullets in the middle of the room and loaded the guns and pistols <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for polly ann had learned to shoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took the loopholes of two sides of the cabin i of the other two and then began the fearful watching and waiting which the frontier knows so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly the cattle stirred again and stampeded to the other corner of the field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came a whisper from polly ann <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i answered running over to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her sharp eyes had not deceived her for mine perceived plainly a dark form skulking in the hickory grove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next a movement behind the rail fence and darting back to my side of the house i made out a long black body wriggling at the edge of the withered cornpatch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how i wished that tom were home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stealthy sound began to intrude itself upon our ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> listening intently i thought it came from the side of the cabin where the leanto was where we stored our wood in winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the black shadow fell on that side and into a patch of bushes peering out of the loophole i could perceive nothing there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noise went on at intervals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all at once there grew on me with horror the discovery that there was digging under the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long the sound continued i know notit might have been an hour it might have been less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i thought i heard it under the wall now beneath the puncheons of the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pitchy blackness within was such that we could not see the boards moving and therefore we must needs kneel down and feel them from time to time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes this one was lifting from its bed on the hard earth beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it rose an inchthen an inch more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gripping the handle of my tomahawk i prayed for guidance in my stroke for the blade might go wild in the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upward crept the board and suddenly it was gone from the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i swung a full circleand to my horror i felt the axe plunging into soft flesh and crunching on a bone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a yell shattered the nights the puncheon fell with a rattle on the boards and my tomahawk was gone from my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without the fierce warcry of the shawanees that i knew so well echoed around the log walls and the door trembled with a blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no time to think my great fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill polly ann <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then i heard her calling out to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cried hide under the shakedown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has i heard her answer and then the sound of a scuffle that maddened me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knife in hand i crept slowly about and put my fingers on a mans neck and side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next polly ann careened against me and i lost him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy davy i heard her gasp look out fer the it was too late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the puncheon rose under me i stumbled and it fell again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more the awful changing notes of the warwhoop sounded without <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a body bumped on the boards a white light rose before my eyes and a sharp pain leaped in my side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then all was black again but i had my senses still and my fingers closed around the knotted muscles of an arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thrust the pistol in my hand against flesh and fired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two of us fell together but the thought of polly ann got me staggering to my feet again calling her name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the grace of god i heard her answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twas she who had the presence of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stumbled over a body in reaching it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we seized the handles and with all our strength hauled it athwart the loose puncheon that seemed to be lifting even then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mighty splintering shook the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried polly ann as our heads knocked together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to find the rifles and prime them seemed to take an age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next i was staring through the loophole along a barrel and beyond it were three black forms in line on a long beam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we firedpolly ann and iat the same time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we saw a comedy of the beam dropping heavily on the foot of another and he limping off with a guttural howl of rage and pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fired a pistol at him but missed him and then i was ramming a powder charge down the long barrel of the rifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly there was silenceeven the children had ceased crying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> outside in the dooryard a feathered figure writhed like a snake towards the fence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon still etched the picture in black and white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shots awoke me i think distant shots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they sounded like the ripping and tearing of cloth for a wound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twas no new sound to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy dear said a voice tenderly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of the mist the tearstained face of polly ann bent over me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put up my hand and dropped it again with a cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then my senses coming with a rush the familiar objects of the cabin outlined themselves toms winter hunting shirt polly anns woollen shift and sunbonnet on their pegs the big stone chimney the ladder to the loft the closed door with a long jagged line across it where the wood was splintered and dearest of all the chubby forms of peggy and little tom playing on the trundle bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then my glance wandered to the floor and on the puncheons were three stains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again came a faroff rattle like stones falling from a great height down a rocky bluff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre fighting at mcafees station said polly ann <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put her cool hand on my head and little tom climbed up on the bed and looked up into my face wistfully calling my name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh davy said his mother i thought ye were never and the redskins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she drew the child away lest he hurt me and shuddered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon twas only a warparty she answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if they beat em off she stopped abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall be saved i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall never forget that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polly ann left my side only to feed the children and to keep watch out of the loopholes and i lay on my back listening and listening to the shots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then though we strained our ears we heard them no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun slid across the heavens and shot narrow blades of light now through one loophole and now through another until a ray slanted from the western wall and rested upon the redandblack paint of two dead bodies in the corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was afeard to open the door and throw em out said polly ann apologetically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them had a great cleft across his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i thought i hit him in the shoulder i exclaimed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polly ann thrust her hand gently across my eyes <end> <end>

<start> <start> i was overwhelmed by the love which had just been revealed to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so i was to be educated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been in my mind these many years but i had never spoken of it to polly ann <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my eyes filled at the thought that she herself had determined upon this sacrifice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were footsteps at the door and these i heard and heeded not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there came a voicea womans voice modulated and trained in the perfections of speech and in the art of treating things lightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sound of that voice i caught my breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry if we have sought for virtue it was the man who answered and stirred another chord of my memory <end> <end>

<start> <start> she paused and joined in the mans laugh <end> <end>

<start> <start> and yet a fortnight ago this sylvan retreat was the scene of murder yes indians said the woman but they are beaten off and forgotten <end> <end>

<start> <start> lets have in they came and i looked on the woman and would have leaped from my bed had the strength been in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> superb she was though her closefitting travelling gown of green cloth was frayed and torn by the briers and the beauty of her face enhanced by the marks of i know not what trials and emotions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little darkpencilled lines under the eyes were nigh robbing these of the haughtiness i had once seen and hated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> set high on her hair was a curving green hat with a feather illsuited to the wilderness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as illequipped as she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a london tailor must have cut his suit of gray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a single band of linen soiled by the journey was wound about his throat and i remember oddly the buttons stuck on his knees and cuffs and these silkembroidered in a crisscross pattern of lighter gray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for his face twas as handsome as ever for dissipation sat well upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my thoughts flew back to that day long gone when a friendless boy rode up a long drive to a pillared mansion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the horse with the craning neck the liveried servant at the bridle the listless young gentleman with the shiny boots reclining on the horseblock and above him under the portico the grand lady whose laugh had made me sad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i remembered too the wild neglected lad who had been to me as a brother warmhearted and generous who had shared what he had with a foundling who had wept with me in my first great sorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i was face to face once more with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady started as she gazed at me and her tired eyes widened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried harry he puts me in mind of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there there sally says he all brats resemble she turned upon him an appealing glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said with a little catch of her breath is there no such thing as oblivion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there a place in the or the lack of it answered mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> riddle pulling out a silver snuffbox from his pocket and staring at it ruefully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damme the snuff i fetched from paris is gone it was the same in rome the lady continued unheeding when we met the izards and at venice that nasty colonel tarleton saw us at the opera <end> <end>

<start> <start> we might as well be speaking the corner where i lay was dark for the cabin had no windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if my life had depended upon speaking i could have found no fit words then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned from me and her mood changed swiftly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for she laughed lightly musically and put a hand on his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perchance i am ghostridden she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not ghosts of a past happiness at all events he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat down on a stool before the hearth and clasping her fingers upon her knee looked thoughtfully into the embers of the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she began to speak in a low even voice he looking down at her his feet apart his hand thrust backward towards the heat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry she said do you remember all our contrivances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how you used to hold my hand in the garden under the table while i talked brazenly to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how jealous jack temple used to get <end> <end>

<start> <start> and he yes blind the lady agreed <end> <end>

<start> <start> we should have gone that night if your courage had my courage <end> <end>

<start> <start> riddle repeated and what i am wondering sarah is how the how do these good people live who helped us when mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> riddle flung his hand eloquently around the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something of disgust in the gesture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is love said the lady in a low tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sally he cried i have visions of you gracing the board at which we sat today patting journeycakes on the hearth stewing squirrel broth with the same pride that you once planned a rout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cleaning the pots and pans and standing anxious at the doorway staring my lord and master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the lady and there was so much of scorn in the words that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come he said i grant now that you could make pans shine like pierglasses that you could cook bacon to a turnalthough i would have laid an hundred guineas against it some years ago <end> <end>

<start> <start> with the intellectual companionship of the mcchesneys and their friends <end> <end>

<start> <start> but now i vow you go beyond she did not answer but sat leaning forward over the hearth he staring at her in angry perplexity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sound broke the afternoon stillnessthe pattering of small bare feet on the puncheons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a tremor shook the womans shoulders and little tom stood before her a quaint figure in a butternut smock his blue eyes questioning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laid a hand on her arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a sudden impulse she turned and flung her arms about the boy and strained him to her and kissed his brown hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he struggled but when she released him he sat very still on her knee looking into her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he was a solemn child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady smiled at him and there were two splashes like raindrops on her fair cheeks <end> <end>

<start> <start> there were gentry too from the tidewaters come to retrieve the fortunes which they had lost by their patriotism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarlett adventurers and neerdoweels who hoped to start with a clean slate and a host of lazy vagrants who thought to scratch the soil and find abundance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must not forget how at the age of seventeen i became a landowner thanks to my name being on the roll of colonel clarks regiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for in a spirit of munificence the assembly of the commonwealth of virginia had awarded to every private in that regiment one hundred and eight acres of land on the ohio river north of the falls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sergeant thomas mcchesney as a reward for his services in one of the severest campaigns in history received a grant of two hundred and sixteen acres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you who will may look at the plat made by william clark surveyor for the board of commissioners and find sixteen acres marked for thomas mcchesney in section and two hundred more in section  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> section fronted the ohio some distance above bear grass creek and was of course on the illinois shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for my own plots some miles in the interior i never saw them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i own them to this day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mention these things as bearing on the story of my life with which i must get on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore i may not dwell upon this injustice to the men who won an empire and were flung a bone long afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was early autumn once more and such a busy week we had had at the mill that tom was perforce obliged to remain at home and help though he longed to be gone with cowan and ray ahunting to the southwest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up rides a man named jarrott flings himself from his horse passes the time of day as he watches the grinding helps tom to tie up a sack or two and hands him a paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says tom staring at it blankly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye wont blame me mac answers mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jarrott somewhat ashamed of his role of processserver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taint read it davy said tom giving it to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stopped the mill and unfolding the paper read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember not the quaint wording of it save that it was illspelled and illwrit generally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short it was a summons for tom to appear before the court at danville on a certain day in the following week and i made out that a mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neville colfax was the plaintiff in the matter and that the suit had to do with land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i exclaimed thats the man for ay ay said tom and sat him down on the meal hev the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried polly ann who had come in theres no chance agin the law said tom hopelessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thars perkins had his land tuck away last year and terrells moved out and twenty more i could name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most the rich bottom he tuck up the critters hev got away yell go to danville and take davy with ye and fight it answered polly ann decidedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy has a word to say i reckon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twas he made the mill and scart that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye have the grit maam he said as he mounted his the remembrance of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> potts weighed heavily upon my mind during the next week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perchance tom would have to pay for this prank likewise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twas indeed a foolish childish thing to have done and i might have known that it would only have put off the evil day of reckoning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since then by reason of the mill site and the business we got by it the land had become the most valuable in that part of the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had i known colonel clarks whereabouts i should have gone to him for advice and comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was we were forced to await the issue without counsel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polly ann and i talked it over many times while tom sat morose and silent in a corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the pioneer pure and simple afraid of no man red or white in open combat but defenceless in such matters as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis davy will save us tom said polly ann with i had indeed been reading at the mill while the hopper emptied itself such odd books as drifted into harrodstown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these was called bacons abridgment it dealt with law and it puzzled me sorely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the children polly ann continuedyell not make me pick up the four of em and pack it to louisiana because mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colfax wants the land weve made for there were four of them now indeedthe youngest still in the bark cradle in the corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he bore a no less illustrious name than that of the writer of these chronicles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be hard to say which was the more troubled tom or i that windy morning we set out on the danville trace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polly ann alone had been sereneay and smiling and hopeful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had kissed us each goodby impartially <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we left her with a future governor of kentucky on her shoulder tripping lightly down to the mill to grind the mcgarrys corn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the forest was cleared at danville justice was housed first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not the serene inexorable dame whom we have seen in pictures holding her scales above the jars of earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> justice at danville was a somewhat highspirited quarrelsome lady who decided matters oftenest with the stroke of a sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a certain dignity about her temple withalfor instance if a judge wore linen that linen must not be soiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor was it etiquette for a judge to lay his own hands in chastisement on contemptuous persons though justice at danville had more compassion than her sisters in older communities upon human failings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a temple built to her of hewed or sawed logs nine inches thickso said the specifications <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within the temple was a rude platform which served as a bar and since justice is supposed to carry a torch in her hand there were no windowsnor any windows in the jail next door where some dozen offenders languished on the afternoon that tom and i rode into town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing auspicious in the appearance of danville and no man might have said then that the place was to be the scene of portentous conventions which were to decide the destiny of a state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was a sprinkling of log cabins some in the building and an inn by courtesy so called <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom and i would have preferred to sleep in the woods near by with our feet to the blaze this was partly from motives of economy and partly because tom in common with other pioneers held an inn in contempt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to come back to our arrival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a sunny and windy afternoon and the leaves were flying in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around the courthouse was a familiar buzzing scenethe backwoodsmen lounging against the wall or brawling over their claims the sleek agents and attorneys and half a dozen of a newer type <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were adventurous young gentlemen of family some of them lawyers and some of them late officers in the continental army who had been rewarded with grants of land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were the patrons of the log tavern which stood near by with the blackened stumps around it where there was much cardplaying and roistering ay and even duelling of nights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thars mac cried a backwoodsman who was sitting on the courthouse steps as we rode up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howdy mac howdy mac said a dozen more paying a tribute to toms popularity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some of them greeted me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is this whar they take a mans land away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says tom jerking his thumb at the open door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom had no intention of uttering a witticism but his words were followed by loud guffaws from all sides even the lawyers joining in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon this is the place tom came the answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon ill take a peep in thar said tom leaping off his horse and shouldering his way to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two elderly gentlemen of grave demeanor sat on stools behind a puncheon table and near them a young man was writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind the young man was a young gentleman who was closing a speech as we entered and he had spoken with such vehemence that the perspiration stood out on his brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a murmur from those listening and i saw tom pressing his way to the front <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hev any of ye seen a feller named colfax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cries tom in a loud voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says he owns the land i another gust of laughter drowned his words and then one of the judges got up and rapped on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gentleman who had just made the speech glared mightily and i supposed he had lost the effect of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you mean by interrupting the court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get out sir or ill have you fined for tom looked dazed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at that moment a hand was laid on his shoulder and tom turned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why says he thars no devil if it aint the colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and quite right tom colonel clark answered smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if your honors please said he this gentleman is an old soldier of mine and unused to the ways of court <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg your the judges smiled back and the colonel led us out of the building <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now tom said he after he had given me a nod and a kind word i know this mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colfax and if you will come into the tavern this evening after court well see tom was very grateful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spent the remainder of the daylight hours with other friends of his shooting at a mark near by serenely confident of the result of his case now that colonel clark had a hand in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom being one of the best shots in kentucky he had won two beaver skins before the early autumn twilight fell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for me i had an afternoon of excitement in the court fascinated by the marvels of its procedures by the impassioned speeches of its advocates by the gravity of its judges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the big room of the tavern was filled with men in heated talk over the days doings some calling out for black betty some for rum and some demanding apple toddies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlords slovenly negro came in with candles their feeble rays reenforcing the firelight and revealing the mudchinked walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom and i had barely sat ourselves down at a table in a corner when in came colonel clark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside him was a certain swarthy gentleman whom i had noticed in the court a man of some thirtyfive years with a fine fleshy face and coalblack hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his expression was not one to give us the hope of an amicable settlementin fact he had the scowl of a thundercloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was talking quite angrily and seemed not to heed those around him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the devil should i see the man clark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the colonel did not answer until they had stopped in front of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> major colfax said he this is sergeant tom mcchesney one of the best friends i have in kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think a vast deal of tom major <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was one of the few that never failed me in the illinois campaign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is as honest as the day you will find him plainspoken if he speaks at all and i have great hopes that you will agree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom the major and i are boyhood friends and for the i fear that your kind efforts will be useless colonel major colfax put in rather tartly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however helpless he might be in a court he could be counted on to stand up stanchly in a personal argument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his retorts would certainly not be brilliant but they surely would be dogged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon yeve got no rights that i know on said tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cleart the land and settled it and i have a better right to it nor any man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ive got a grant a henderson grant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the major tis so much i reckon its good enough fer me answered tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it come from those who blazed their way out here and druv the redskins off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know nothin about this newfangled law but tis a queer thing to my thinkin if them major colfax turned to colonel clark with marked impatience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you it would be useless clark said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i care not a fig for a few paltry acres and as god hears me im a reasonable man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not look it then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i swear by the evangels ill let no squatter have the better of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not serve virginia for gold or land but i lost my fortune in that service and before i know it these backwoodsmen will have every acre of my grant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its an old story said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colfax hotly and why the devil did we fight england if it wasnt that every man should have his rights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by god ill not be frightened or wheedled out of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sent an agent to kentucky to deal politely and reasonably with these gentry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what did they do to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of them threw him out neck and crop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i am not mistaken said major colfax fixing a piercing eye upon tom if i am not mistaken it was this worthy sergeant of yours who came near to hanging him and made the poor devil flee kentucky for his this remark brought me near to an untimely laugh at the remembrance of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> potts and this though i was far too sober over the outcome of the conference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel clark seized hold of a chair and pushed it under major colfax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit down gentlemen we are not so far apart said the colonel coolly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slovenly negro lad passing at that time he caught him by the sleeve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here boy a bowl of toddy quick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mind you brew it strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now tom said he what is this fine tale about a twant nothin said tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you tell me you didnt try to hang mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you nothin said tom and his jaw was set more stubbornly than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> major colfax glanced at colonel clark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could hold my tongue no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> major colfax is unjust sir i cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says colonel clark turning to me sharply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you had a hand in this davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might have guessed who the devil is this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sort of ward of mine answers the colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drummer boy financier strategist in my illinois campaign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allow me to present to you major mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when my men objected to marching through iceskimmed water up to their necks mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie showed god bless my soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the major staring at me from under his black eyebrows he was but a with an old head on his shoulders said the colonel and his banter made me flush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the negro boy arriving with the toddy colonel clark served out three generous gourdfuls a smaller one for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your health my friends and i drink to a peaceful you may drink to the devil if you like says major colfax glaring at tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come davy said colonel clark when he had taken half the gourd lets have the tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill warrant youre i flushed again and began by stammering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i had a great fear that major colfaxs temper would fly into bits when he heard it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir said i i was grinding corn at the mill when the man came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought him a smoothmannered person and he did not give his business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was just for wheedling me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he was all for praise of thomas mcchesney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is at the far pasture said i and may be looked for any moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon he sits down and tries to worm out of me the business of the mill the yield of the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that he begins to talk about the great people he knows sevier and shelby and robertson and boone and the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay and his intimates the randolphs and the popes and the colfaxes in virginia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> demanded the colonel as he dipped himself more of the toddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes colonel campbell was his intimate and ranted if he did not tarry a week with him at abingdon on his journeys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that he follows me to the cabin and sees polly ann and tom and the children on the floor poking a possum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah says he in his softest voice a pleasant family scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he praised the mill site and the land all over again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis good enough for a farmer says tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who holds under hendersons grant i cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twas that you wished to say an hour by the eternal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried colonel clark bringing down i glanced at major colfax but for the life of me i could make nothing of his look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what did your man say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called on the devil to bite me sir i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the colonel put down his gourd and began to laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the major was looking at me fixedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was then polly ann called him a thief to take away the land tom had fought for and paid for and tilled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man was all politeness once more said that the matter was unfortunate and that a new and good he said that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interrupted major colfax half rising so i thought sir i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tut colfax said the colonel pulling him by the sleeve of his greatcoat sit down and let the lad finish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boone had told me of a land agent who had made off with colonel campbells silver spoons from abingdon and how the colonel had ridden east and west after him for a week with a rope hanging on his saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to tell this story and instead of the description of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boones man i put in that of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pottsin height some five feet nine spare of sallow complexion and a green greatcoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> major colfax leaped up in his chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shouted you described the colonel clark roared with laughter thereby spilling some of his toddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill warrant he did so he cried and ill warrant theres not a great deal more sir i answered looking apprehensively at major colfax who still stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man vowed i lied but tom laid hold of him and which would ill have suited your purpose put in the we put him in a loft sir and then i told tom that he was not campbells thief at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i had a craving to scare the man out of kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i rode off to the neighbors and gave them the tale and bade them come after nightfall as though to hang campbells thief which they did and they were near to smashing the door trying to get in the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom told them the rascal had escaped but they must needs come in and have jigs and toddies until midnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were gone and we called down the man from the loft he was in such a state that he could scarce find the rungs of the ladder with his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rode away into the night and that was the last colonel clark was speechless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when for the moment he would conquer his mirth a glance at major colfax would set him off again in laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought my colonel more human than of old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried giving a poke to the the majors face was purplewith what emotion i could not say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he swung full at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to tell me that you were the general of this hoaxyou <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he demanded in a strange voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing seemed an injustice to me sir i replied in a rascal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the major a knave a poltroon a simpleton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he came to me with no tale of having been outwitted by a stripling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon major colfax began to shake gently at first and presently he was in such a gale of laughter that i looked on him in amazement colonel clark joining in again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the majors eye rested at length upon tom and gradually he grew calm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mcchesney said he well have no bickerings in court among soldiers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the land is yours and tomorrow my attorney shall give you a deed of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your hand the stubbornness vanished from toms face and there came instead a dazed expression as he thrust a great hard hand into the majors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twant the land sir he stammered these varmints of settlers is gittin thick as flies in july <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twas there there said the major i thank the lord i came to kentucky to see for myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have plenty moreand little else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned quizzically to colonel clark revealing a line of strong white teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose we drink a health to your drummer boy said he lifting up his gourd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis what yeve a right to davy said polly ann and she handed me a little buckskin bag on which she had been sewing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i opened it with trembling fingers and poured out chinking on the table such a motley collection of coins as was never seenspanish milled dollars english sovereigns and crowns and shillings paper issues of the confederacy and i know not what else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom looked on with a grin while little tom and peggy reached out their hands in delight their mother vigorously blocking their intentions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yeve earned it yerself said polly ann forestalling my protest tis what ye got by the mill and ive laid and what do you get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cried striving by feigned anger to keep the tears back from my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you faith she answered we have the mill that ye gave us and the farm and toms rifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon well fare better than ye think tho well miss ye sore about the i picked out two sovereigns from the heap dropped them in the bag and thrust it into my hunting shirt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there said i my voice having no great steadiness not a penny more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill keep the bag for your sake she had had a song on her lips ever since our coming back from danville seven days agone a song on her lips and banter on her tongue as she made me a new hunting shirt and breeches for the journey across the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now with a sudden movement she burst into tears and flung her arms about my neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh davy tis no time to be stubborn she sobbed and eddication is a costly thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever sence i found ye on the trace years ago ive thought of ye one day as a great man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when ye come back to us so big and larned id wish to be saying with pride that i helped and who else polly ann <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i faltered my heart racked with the parting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you found me a homeless davy yell not forget us when yere great i know she stood back and smiled at me through her tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light of heaven was in that smile and i have dreamed of it even since age has crept upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> truly god sets his own mark on the pure in heart on the unselfish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i glanced for the last time around the rude cabin every timber of which was dedicated to our sacrifices and our love the fireplace with its rough stones on the pegs the quaint butternut garments which polly ann had stitched the baby in his bark cradle the rough bedstead and the little trundle pushed under itand the very homely odor of the place is dear to me yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> despite the rigors and the dangers of my life here should i ever again find such happiness and peace in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children clung to my knees and with a god bless ye davy and come back to us tom squeezed my hand until i winced with pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i leaped on the mare and with blinded eyes rode down the familiar trail past the mill to harrodsburg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neville colfax was waiting to take me across the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a story in every mans life like the kernel in the shell of a hickory nut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am ill acquainted with the arts of a biographer but i seek to give in these pages little of the shell and the whole of the kernel of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twould be unwise and tiresome to recount the journey over the bare mountains with my new friend and benefactor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a strange gentleman now jolly enough to make me shake with laughter and forget the sorrow of my parting now moody for a night and a day now he was all sweetness now all fire now he was abstemious now selfindulgent and prodigal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a will like flint and under it a soft heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cross his moods and he hated you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never thought to cross them therefore he called me davy and his friendliness grew with our journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his anger turned against rocks and rivers landlords and emigrants but never against me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for this i was silently thankful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how had he come to take me over the mountains and to put me in the way of studying law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mindful of the kernel of my story i have shortened the chapter to tell you out of the proper place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> major colfax had made tom and me sup with himself and colonel clark at the inn in danville <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so pleased had the major professed himself with my story of having outwitted his agent that he must needs have more of my adventures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel clark gave him some and tomhis tongue loosed by the toddyothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the colonel added to the debt i owed him by suggesting that major colfax take me to virginia and recommend me to a lawyer there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay cried the major i will do more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like the lad for he is modest despite the way you have paraded him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have an uncle in richmond judge wentworth to whom i will take him in person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the judge has done with him if he is not flayed and tattooed thus did i break through my environment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was settled that i should meet the major in seven days at harrodstown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once in the journey did the major make mention of a subject which had troubled me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy said he clark has changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is not the same man he was when i saw him in williamsburg virginia has used him shamefully sir i answered and suddenly there came flooding to my mind things i had heard the colonel say in the campaign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> commonwealths have short memories said the major they will accept any sacrifice with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shakespeare i believe speaks of royal ingratitudehe knew not commonwealths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clark was closelipped once not given to levity andto toddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there there he is my friend as well as yours and i will prove it by pushing his cause in virginia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the devil fend me from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a monarch would have given him fifty thousand acres on the wabash a palace and a sufficient annuity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> virginia has given him a sword eight thousand wild acres to be sure repudiated the debts of his army and left him to starve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there no room for a genius at length as christmas drew near we came to major colfaxs seat some forty miles out of the town of richmond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was called nevilles grange the majors grandfather having so named it when he came out from england some sixty years before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a huge rambling draughty house of woodmortgaged so the major cheerfully informed me thanks to the patriotism of the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at nevilles grange the major kept a somewhat roisterous bachelors hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place was overrun with negroes and dogs and scarce a night went by that there was not merrymaking in the house with the neighbors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time passed pleasantly enough until one frosty january morning major colfax had a twinge of remembrance cried out for horses took me into richmond and presented me to that very learned and decorous gentleman judge wentworth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my studies began within the hour of my arrival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall burden no one with the dry chronicles of a law office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the acquirement of learning is a slow process in life and perchance a slower one in the telling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lacked not application during the three years of my stay in richmond and to earn my living i worked at such odd tasks as came my way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge resembled major colfax in but one trait he was choleric <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was painstaking and cautious and i soon found out that he looked askance upon any one whom his nephew might recommend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he liked the major but he vowed him to be a roisterer and spendthrift and one day some months after my advent the judge asked me flatly how i came to fall in with major colfax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of this conversation he took my breath away by bidding me come to live with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like many lawyers of that time he had a little house in one corner of his grounds for his office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it stood under great spreading trees and there i was wont to sit through many a summer day wrestling with the authorities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the evenings we would have political arguments for the confederacy was in a seething state between the federalists and the republicans over the new constitution now ratified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between the federalists and the jacobins i would better say for the virulence of the french revolution was soon to be reflected among the parties on our side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kentucky swelled into an unmanageable territory was come near to rebellion because the government was not strong enough to wrest from spain the free navigation of the mississippi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet i yearned to go back and looked forward eagerly to the time when i should have stored enough in my head to gain admission to the bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was therefore greatly embarrassed when my examinations came by an offer from judge wentworth to stay in richmond and help him with his practice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an offer not to be lightly set aside and yet i had made up my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flew into a passion because of my desire to return to a wild country of outlaws and vagabonds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why damme he cried kentucky and this pretty state of franklin which desired to chip off from north carolina are traitorous places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> intriguing with a spanish minister and the spanish governor of louisiana to secede from their own people and join the king of spain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed if our new federal constitution is adopted i would hang jack sevier of franklin and your kentuckian wilkinson to the highest i can see the little gentleman as he spoke his black broadcloth coat and lace ruffles his hand clutching the gold head of his cane his face screwed up with indignation under his white wig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on a sunday and he was standing by the lilac bushes on the lawn in front of his square brick house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david said he more calmly i trust i have taught you something besides the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i trust i have taught you that a strong federal government alone will be the salvation you cannot blame kentucky greatly sir said i feeling that i must stand up for my friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the federal government has done little enough for its people and treated them to a deal of neglect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they won that western country for themselves with no federal nor virginia or north carolina troops to help them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no man east of the mountains knows what that fight has been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no man east of the mountains knows the horror of that indian warfare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this government gives them no protection now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay congress cannot even procure for them an outlet for their commerce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> spain closes the mississippi arrests our merchants seizes their goods and often throws them into prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no the judge stared at me aghast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time what he sputtered what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are a separatist you whom i have received into the bosom of my family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seizing the cane at the middle he brandished it in my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont misunderstand me sir said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have given me books to read and have taught me what may be the destiny of our nation on this continent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must forgive a people whose lives have been spent in a fierce struggle for their homes whose families have nearly all lost some member by massacre who are separated he looked at me speechless and turned and walked into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i had sinned past forgiveness and i was beyond description uncomfortable for he had been like a parent to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the next morning at half after seven he walked into the little office and laid down some gold pieces on my table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gold was very scarce in those days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are for your journey david said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my only comfort in your going back is that you may grow up to put some temperance into their wild heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a commission for you at jonesboro in what was once the unspeakable state of franklin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can stop there on your way to kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew from his pocket a great bulky letter addressed to thomas wright esquire barristeratlaw in jonesboro north carolina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the good gentleman could not bring himself to write franklin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was late in september of the year when i set out on my homeward wayfor kentucky was home to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was going back to polly ann and tom and visions of that homecoming rose before my eyes as i rode <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a packet in my saddlebags were some dozen letters which mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wrenn the schoolmaster at harrodstown had writ at polly anns bidding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wrenn was plainly an artist and had set down on the paper the words just as they had flowed from her heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay and there was news in the letters though not surprising news among those pioneer families whom god blessed so abundantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since david ritchie mcchesney i mention the name with pride had risen above the necessities of a bark cradle two more had succeeded him a brother and a sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spurred my horse onward and thought impatiently of the weary leagues between my family and me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have often pictured myself on that journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was twentyone years of age though one would have called me older <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my looks were nothing to boast of and i was grown up tall and weedy so that i must have made quite a comical sight with my long legs dangling on either side of the pony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wore a suit of gray homespun and in my saddlebags i carried four precious law books the stock in trade which my generous patron had given me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as i mounted the slopes of the mountains my spirits rose too at the prospect of the life before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the woods were all aflame with color with wine and amber and gold and the hills wore the misty mantle of shadowy blue so dear to my youthful memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i left the rude taverns of a morning and jogged along the heights i watched the vapors rise and troll away from the valleys far beneath and saw great flocks of ducks and swans and cackling geese darkening the air in their southward flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strange that i fell in with no company for the trail leading into the tennessee country was widened and broadened beyond belief and everywhere i came upon blackened fires and abandoned leantos and refuse bones gnawed by the wolves and bleached by the weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i slept in some of these leantos with my fire going brightly indifferent to the howl of wolves in chase or the scream of a panther pouncing on its prey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i was born of the wilderness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had no terrors for me nor did i ever feel alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great cliffs with their clinging gnarled trees the vast mountains clothed in the motley colors of the autumn the sweet and smoky smell of the indian summerall were dear to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i drew near to jonesboro my thoughts began to dwell upon that strange and fascinating man who had entertained polly ann and tom and me so lavishly on our way to kentuckycaptain john sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he had made a great noise in the world since then and the wrath of such men as my late patron was heavy upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes john sevier nollichucky jack had been a king in all but name since i had seen him the head of such a principality as stirred the blood to read about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it comprised the watauga settlement among the mountains of what is now tennessee and was called prosaically as is the wont of the anglosaxon the free state of franklin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were certain conservative and unimaginative souls in this mountain principality who for various reasons held their old allegiance to the state of north carolina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one colonel tipton led these loyalist forces and armed partisans of either side had for some years ridden up and down the length of the land burning and pillaging and slaying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we in virginia had heard of two sets of courts in franklin of two sets of legislators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of late the rumor had grown persistently that nollichucky jack was now a kind of fugitive and that he had passed the summer pleasantly enough fighting indians in the vicinity of nickajack cave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was court day as i rode into the little town of jonesboro the air sparkling like a blue diamond over the mountain crests and i drew deep into my lungs once more the scent of the frontier life i had loved so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the streets currents of excited men flowed and backed and eddied backwoodsmen and farmers in the familiar hunting shirts of hide or homespun and lawyers in dress less rude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a line of horses stood kicking and switching their tails in front of the log tavern rough carts and wagons had been left here and there with their poles on the ground and between these piles of skins were heaped up and bags of corn and grain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the log meetinghouse was deserted but the courthouse was the centre of such a swirling crowd as i had often seen at harrodstown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there are brawls and brawls and i should have thought with shame of my kentucky bringingup had i not perceived that this was no ordinary court day and that an unusual excitement was in the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tying my horse and making my way through the press in front of the tavern door i entered the common room and found it stifling brawling and drinking going on apace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarce had i found a seat before the whole room was emptied by one consent all crowding out of the door after two men who began a roughandtumble fight in the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had seen roughandtumble fights in kentucky and if i have forborne to speak of them it is because there always has been within me a loathing for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so i sat quietly in the common room until the landlord came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked him if he could direct me to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wrights house as i had a letter for that gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his answer was to grin at me incredulously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckoned you wahnt from these parts said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nollichucky jacks been heah in jonesboro young ay sevier he repeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with martin and tipton and all the caroliny men right heah having a council of mility officers in the courthouse in rides jack with his frontier boys like a whirlwind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he beant afeard of em and a bench warrant out agin him for high treason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had sech a jamboree sence i kept the tavern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they was in this here room most of the day and they was five fights before they and colonel tipton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh tipton said he he haint afeard neither but he and where is sevier now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long hev you ben in town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wal said he shifting his tobacco from one sallow cheek to the other i reckon he and his boys rud out just afore you come in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mark me he added when i tell ye therell be trouble yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton and martin and the caroliny folks is burnin mad with chucky jack for the murder of corn tassel and other peaceful chiefs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but jack hez a wild lot with himsome of the nollichucky cave traders and theres one young lad that looks like he was a gentleman once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon jack himself wouldnt like to get into a fight with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great goliah he exclaimed running to the door ef thar aint agoin to be another fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never seed sech i likewise ran to the door and this fight interested me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a great blackbearded mountaineerfarmer desperado in the midst of a circle pouring out a torrent of abuse at a tall young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that thars hump gibson said the landlord genially pointing out the blackbearded ruffian and the young lawyer feller hez git a jedgment agin him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got spunk but i reckon humpll tar the innards outn him yell git jedgment agin me ye caroliny splinter will ye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill pay bill wilder the skins when i git ready and all the pinhook youll pay bill wilder or go to jail by the eternal cried the young man quite as angrily whereupon i looked upon him with a mixture of admiration and commiseration with a gulping certainty in my throat that i was about to see murder done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a strange young man with the rare marked look that would compel even a poor memory to pick him out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for example he was very tall and very slim with red hair blown every which way over a high and towering forehead that seemed as long as the face under it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the face too was long and all freckled by the weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blue eyes held me in wonder and these blazed with such prodigious wrath that if a look could have killed hump gibson would have been stricken on the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gibson was however very much alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> skin out o here afore i kill ye he shouted and he charged at the slim young man like a buffalo while the crowd held its breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i who had looked upon cruel sights in my day was turning away with a kind of sickening when i saw the slim young man dodge the rush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with two strides of his long legs he reached the fence ripped off the topmost rail and his huge antagonist having changed his direction and coming at him with a bellow was met with the point of a scantling in the pit of his stomach and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gibson fell heavily to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had all happened in a twinkling and there was a moments lull while the minds of the onlookers needed readjustment and then they gave vent to ecstasies of delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the landlord breathlessly he awestruck i looked at the tall young man and he was the very essence of wrath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unmindful of the plaudits he stood brandishing the fencerail over the great writhing figure on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i recall that this fact gave a twinge to something in my memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on hump gibson he cried come on!at which the crowd went wild with pure joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thought ye was goin to eat im up hump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye aint hed yer meal yet hump reminded another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hump gibson arose slowly out of the dust yet he did not stand straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the young lawyerfellow and he thrust the point of the rail within a foot of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lacked the supreme test of courage which was demanded on this occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he turned and walked away very slowly as though his pace might mitigate in some degree the shame of his retreat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man flung away the fencerail and thrusting aside the overzealous among his admirers he strode past me into the tavern his anger still hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i remembered a slim wild sandyhaired boy digging his toes in the red mud long ago at the waxhaws settlement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i recalled with a smile my own fierce struggle at the schoolhouse with the same boy and how his slobbering had been my salvation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned and went in after him with the landlord who was rubbing his hands with glee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon hump wont come crowin round heah any more cot days mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson swept the room with his eyes and then glared at the landlord so that he gave back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson i believe hes afraid to race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a horse that could show heels to a light seemed to dawn on the landlords countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried ye dont mean with sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay says the landlord hes been afightin with sevier all summer and i reckon he aint afeard of nothin any more than you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> waithis name was temple nick temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was going to bet me a sixforty he has at nashboro that his horse could beat mine on the greasy cove track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the landlord apologetically nollichucky is he a man of honor or isnt he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord sir i only seen him once but id stake my oath on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to say mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple has been here nicholas temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bewildered landlord turned towards me helplessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who the devil are you sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith a thoroughbred hoss says he sech nostrils and sech a gray eye with the devil in it fer goyellow they rud into town he lowered his voice for the room was filling snapped their fingers at tipton and his warrant and rud out agin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my god but that was like nollichucky jack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson who had been divided between astonishment and impatience and anger burst out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the devil do you mean by interfering with my business sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because it is my business too i answered quite as by jehovah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried jackson come outside sir the landlord backed away and the men in the tavern began to press around us expectantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont let him git near no fences stranger said another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson turned on this man with such truculence that he edged away to the rear of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson starting for the door before i could reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed perforce not without misgivings the crowd pushing eagerly after <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before we reached the dusty street jackson began pulling off his coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a trice the shouting onlookers had made a ring and we stood facing each other he in his shirtsleeves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well fight fair said he his lips wetting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very good said i if you are still accustomed to this hasty manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not asked my name my i know not whether it was what i said that made him stare or how i said it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pistols if you like said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said i i am in a hurry to find mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i you fought me this way once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noise of the crowd was hushed and they drew nearer to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson said i you are a lawyer and a gentleman and so am i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not care to be beaten to a pulp but i am not afraid of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i am in a hurry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will step back into the tavern i will explain to you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson stared at me the more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the eternal said he you are a cool man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me my coat he shouted to the bystanders and they helped him on with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said he as they made to follow him keep back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would talk to this gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the heavens he cried when he had gained the room i believe you are not afraid of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw it in your then i laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson said i doubtless you do not remember a homeless boy named david whom you took to your i do he exclaimed as i live i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why we slept and you stumped your toe getting into bed and swore said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that he laughed so heartily that the landlord came running across the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we fought together at the old fields school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by god but what about temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah i answered i come to that quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after i left your uncles house is he a charlestown temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i spent some time gambling and horse racing with the gentry there and i know many of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a wild lad i repeat his exact words and i ran up a bill in charlestown that would have filled a folio volume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith all i had left me was the clothes on my back and a good horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made up my mind one night that if i could pay my debts and get out of charlestown i would go into the back country and study law and sober down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> braiden in the ordinary who staked me two hundred dollars at rattleandsnap against my horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i left charlestown with honor i studied law at salisbury in north carolina you seem to have the talent said i smiling at the remembrance of the hump gibson incident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is my history in a nutshell said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he added since you are mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temples cousin and friend and an old acquaintance of mine to boot i will where is that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill stake a cowbell that sevier will stop at the widow browns he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill put you on the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mind you you are to tell mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple that he is to come ill warrant him to come said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon we left the inn together more amicably than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson had a thoroughbred horse near by that was a pleasure to see and my admiration of his mount seemed to set me as firmly in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacksons esteem again as that gentleman himself sat in the saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as good as his word rode out with me some distance on the road and reminded me at the last that nick was to race him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not to my credit that i should have lost the trail after mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the night was dark the country unknown to me and heavily wooded and mountainous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in addition to these things my mind ran like fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my thoughts sometimes flew back to the wondrous summer evening when i trod the nollichucky trace with tom and polly ann when i first looked down upon the log palace of that prince of the border john sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i remembered him broad shouldered handsome gay a courtier in buckskin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> small wonder he was idolized by the watauga settlers that he had been their leader in the struggle of franklin for liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and small wonder that nick temple should be in his following <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mind was in a torment concerning him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should i speak of having seen her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went blindly through the woods for hours after the night fell my horse stumbling and weary until at length i came to a lonely clearing on the mountain side and a fierce pack of dogs dashed barking at my horses heels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a dark cabin ahead indistinct in the starlight and there i knocked until a gruff voice answered me and a tousled man came to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i had missed the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook his head when i asked for the widow browns and bade me share his bed for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i would go on i was used to the backwoods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon he thawed a little kicked the dogs and pointed to where the mountain dipped against the starstudded sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a trail there which led direct to the widow browns if i could follow it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once the fear had settled deeply of missing nick at the widow browns i put my mind on my journey and thanks to my early training i was able to keep the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doubled around the spurs forded stony brooks in diagonals and often in the darkness of the mountain forest i had to feel for the blazes on the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gained the notch with the small hours of the morning started on with the descent crisscrossing following a stream here and a stream there until at length the song of the higher waters ceased and i knew that i was in the valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly there was no crowncover over my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had gained the road once more and i followed it hopefully avoiding the stumps and the deep wagon ruts where the ground was spongy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning light revealed a milky mist through which the trees showed like phantoms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there came stains upon the mist of royal purple of scarlet of yellow like a mandarins robe peeps of deep blue fading into azure as the mist lifted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fiery eye of the sun was cocked over the crest and beyond me i saw a house with its logs all golden brown in the level rays the withered cornstalks orange among the blackened stumps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my horse stopped of his own will at the edge of the clearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cock crew a lean hound prostrate on the porch of the house rose to his haunches sniffed growled leaped down and ran to the road and sniffed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i listened startled and made sure of the distant ring of many hoofs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet i stayed there irresolute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could it be tipton and his men riding from jonesboro to capture sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hoof beats grew louder and then the hound in the road gave tongue to the short sharp bark that is the call to arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other dogs hitherto unseen took up the cry and turning in my saddle i saw a body of men riding hard at me through the alley in the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at their head on a heavy stronglegged horse was one who might have stood for the figure of turbulence and i made no doubt that this was colonel tipton himselfcolonel tipton once secessionist now champion of the old north state and archenemy of john sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sight of me he reined up so violently that his horse went back on his haunches and the men behind were near overriding him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look out boys he shouted with a fierce oath theyve got guards out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flung back one hand to his holster for a pistol while the other reached for the powder flask at his belt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he primed the pan and seeing me immovable set his horse forward at an amble his pistol at the cock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a traveller from virginia i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what are you doing here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have just this moment come here said i as calmly he glared at me purpling perplexed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he pointing at the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton turned to his men who were listening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surround the house he cried and watch this i rode on perforce towards the house with tipton and three others while his men scattered over the cornfield and cursed the dogs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then we saw in the open door the figure of a woman shading her eyes with her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we pulled up five of us before the porch in front of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good morning colonel answered the widow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton leaped from his horse flung the bridle to a companion and put his foot on the edge of the porch to mount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady turned deftly seized a chair from within and pulled it across the threshold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat herself down firmly an expression on her face which hinted that the late lamented mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brown had been a dominated man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel tipton stopped staggering from the very impetus of his charge and gazed at her blankly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have come for colonel sevier he blurted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then his anger rising i will have no trifling maam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont tell me answered the widow in a tone that was wholly conversational <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is in this house shouted the colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon youve guessed wrong colonel said the widow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an awkward pause until tipton heard a titter behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a warrant against the scoundrel for high treason he cried and by god i will search the house still the widow sat tight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rock of ages was neither more movable nor calmer than she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely colonel you would not invade the house of an the colonel evidently with a great effort throttled his wrath for the moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his new tone was apologetic but firm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i regret to have to do so maam said he but both the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeated the widow seemingly tickled at the word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she smiled indulgently at the colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton that the law compels you to arrest such a good friend of yours as colonel sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a second titter behind him whereat he swung round quickly and the crimson veins in his face looked as if they must burst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw me with my hand over my mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shouted and turning again leaped to the porch and tried to squeeze past the widow into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shrieked giving him a vigorous push backwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the four of us his three men and myself laughed outright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he returned to the attack again and again and yet at the crucial moment his courage would fail him and he would let the widow thrust him back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly i became aware that there were two new spectators of this comedy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i started and looked again and was near to crying out at sight of one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others did cry out but tipton paid no heed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten years had made his figure more portly but i knew at once the man in the wellfitting hunting shirt with the long hair flowing to his shoulders with the keen dark face and courtly bearing and humorous eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes humorous even now for he stood smiling at this comedy played by his enemy unmindful of his peril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the widow saw him before tipton did so intent was he on the struggle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton drew back involuntarily and a smile broadened on the widows face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shame on you for doubting a ladys tipton turned stared as a man might who sees a ghost and broke into such profanity as i have seldom heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the eternal god john sevier he shouted ill colonel sevier merely made a little ironical bow and looked at the gentleman beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have surrendered to colonel love he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton snatched from his belt the pistol which he might have used on me and there flashed through my head the thought that some powder might yet be held in its pan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cried out all of us his men the widow and myself all save sevier who stood quietly smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly while we waited for murder a tall figure shot out of the door past the widow the pistol flew out of tiptons hand and tipton swung about with something like a bellow to face mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and oddly enough at that time riddles words of long ago came to me god help the woman you love or the man you fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was thin even to seeming frailness yet it was the frailness of the racehorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the golden hair suntanned awry across his forehead the face the same thin and finely cut face of the boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gray eyes held an anger that did not blaze it was far more dangerous than that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel john tipton looked and as i live he recoiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you touch him ill kill you said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor did he say it angrily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i marked for the first time that he held a pistol in his slim fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what tipton might have done when he swung to his new bearings is mere conjecture for colonel sevier himself stepped up on the porch laid his hand on temples arm and spoke to him in a low tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he said we didnt hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the astonishing thing was that neither of them for the moment paid any attention to the infuriated man beside them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he smiledthe smile the landlord had described the smile that made men and women willing to die for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that colonel sevier stooped down and picked up the pistol from the floor of the porch and handed it with a bow to tipton butt first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton took it seemingly without knowing why and at that instant a negro boy came around the house leading a horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sevier mounted it without a protest from any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am ready to go with you gentlemen he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel tipton slipped his pistol back into his belt stepped down from the porch and leaped into his saddle and he and his men rode off into the stumplined alley in the forest that was called a road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nick stood beside the widow staring after them until they had disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shouted to the gaping negro who vanished on the errand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rescue him maam cried nick beginning to pace up and down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cozby and evans are there and before night we shall have made jonesboro la mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple said the widow with unfeigned admiration i never saw the like of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i know john tipton and hell have colonel sevier started for then well follow says nick beginning to pace again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly at a cry from the widow he stopped and stared at me a light in his eye like a point of steel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hand slipped to his waist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a spy he said and turned and smiled at the lady who was watching him with a kind of fascination but damnably cool he continued looking at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder if he thinks to outride me on that beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look you sir he cried as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> browns negro came back struggling with a deepribbed highcrested chestnut that was making half circles on his hind legs ill give you to the edge of the woods and lay you a sixforty against a pair god forbid that i ever do i answered fervently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he exclaimed and you here with him on i am here with him on no errand said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and his crew came on me a quarter of an hour since at the edge of the clearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple i am here to find you and egad youll have to ride like the devil then said he and he stooped and snatched the widows hand and kissed it with a daring gallantry that i had thought to find in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raised his eyes to hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple she saidthere was a tremor he snatched the bridle from the boy and with one leap he was on the rearing wheeling horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on he cried to me and waving his hat at the lady on the porch he started off with a gallop up the trail in the opposite direction from that which tiptons men had taken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that i saw of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholas temple on that ride to turners was his back and presently i lost sight of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in truth i never got to turners at all for i met him coming back at the winds pace a huge swarthy determined man at his side and four others spurring after the spume dripping from the horses mouths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did not so much as look at me as they passed and there was nothing left for me to do but to turn my tired beast and follow at any pace i could make towards jonesboro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was late in the afternoon before i reached the town the town set down among the hills like a caldron boiling over with the wrath of franklin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the news of the capture of their beloved sevier had flown through the mountains like seeds on the autumn wind and from north south east and west the faithful were coming in cursing tipton and carolina as they rode <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tethered my tired beast at the first picket and was no sooner on my feet than i was caught in the hurrying stream of the crowd and fairly pushed and beaten towards the courthouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around it a thousand furious men were packed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard cheering hoarse and fierce cries threats and imprecations and i knew that they were listening to oratory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was suddenly shot around the corner of a house saw the orator himself and gasped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something awe impelling in the tall slim boyish figure that towered above the crowd in the finely wrought passionate face in the voice charged with such an anger as is given to few men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what has north carolina done for franklin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you gave her to the confederacy for a war debt and the confederacy flung her back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you shook yourselves free from carolinas tyranny and traitors betrayed you again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now they have betrayed your leader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you avenge him or will you sit down like cowards while they his voice was drowned but he stood immovable with arms folded until there was silence again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried and the roar rose again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by tomorrow we shall have two thousand here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> invade north carolina humble pandemonium reigned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hats were flung in the air rifles fired shouts and curses rose and blended into one terrifying note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gradually in the midst of this mad uproar the crowd became aware that another man was standing upon the stump from which nicholas temple had leaped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the huge swarthy man i had seen riding hard with nick that morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sculptor might have chosen his face and frame for a type of the ironhanded leader of pioneers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will was supreme in the great featuresinflexible indomitable will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hunting shirt was open across his great chest his black hair fell to his shoulders and he stood with a compelling hand raised for silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he spoke slowly resonantly men fell back before his words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temples courage and above all his loyalty to our beloved general said major cozby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple is young and the heated counsels of youth must not prevail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friends in order to save jack his voice strong as it was was lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got silence again by the magnetic strength he had in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very good he said but get your general first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we lead you across the mountains now his blood will be upon your heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no man is a better friend to jack sevier than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leave his rescue to me and i will get him for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused and they were stilled perforce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will get him for you he repeated slowly or north there was an instant when they might have swung either way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> came in a thin piping voice from somewhere near the stump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may have been this that turned their minds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> others took up the question i dont know cried the major i dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i did know i wouldnt tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i will get nollichucky jack if i have to burn morganton and rake the five hundred hands flew up five hundred voices cried im with ye major cozby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the major only shook his head and smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he said was lost in the roar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fighting my way forward i saw him get down from the stump put his hand kindly on nicks shoulder and lead him into the courthouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were followed by a score of others and the door was shut behind them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was then i bethought myself of the letter to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wright and i sought for some one who would listen to my questions as to his whereabouts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length the man himself was pointed out to me haranguing an excited crowd of partisans in front of his own gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some twenty minutes must have passed before i could get any word with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a vigorous little man with black eyes like buttons he wore brown homespun and white stockings and his hair was clubbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had yielded the ground to another orator i handed him the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew me aside read it on the spot and became all hospitality at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town was full and though he had several friends staying in his house i should join them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dinner had been forgotten that day but would i enter and partake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short i found myself suddenly provided for and i lost no time in getting my weary mount into mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i sat down with several other gentlemen at mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wrights board where there was much guessing as to major cozbys plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no other man west of the mountains could have calmed that crowd after that young daredevil temple had stirred them up declared mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ventured to say that i had business with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith then i will invite him here said my host <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie that he is a trigger set on the hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he does not fancy you he may quarrel with you and shoot you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he is in no temper to be trifled i am not an easy person to quarrel with i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to look at you i shouldnt say that you were said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are going to the courthouse and i will see if i can get a word with the young hotspur and send him i waited on the porch as the day waned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tumult of the place had died down for men were gathering in the houses to discuss and conjecture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and presently sauntering along the street in a careless fashion his spurs trailing in the dust came nicholas temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped before the house and stared at me with a fine insolence and i wondered whether i myself had not been too hasty in reclaiming him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a greeting died on my lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir he said so you are the gentleman who i dog no one mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well not quibble about words said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would it be impertinent to ask your businessand perhaps your did not mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might have mentioned it i did not hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it at that i lost my temper entirely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be and it may not i retorted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am david he changed before my eyes as he stared at me and then ere i knew it he had me by both arms crying david ritchie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my davywho ran away from me and we were going to kentucky together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i have never forgiven youthe smile that there was no resisting belied his words as he put his face close to mine i never will forgive you <end> <end>

<start> <start> and when i woke up the world was black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed your trail down the drive and to the cross it was not ingratitude nick i said you were all i had in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i faltered the sadness of that faroff time coming over me in a flood and the remembrance of his generous sorrow for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how the devil did you track me to the widow browns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson had a shrewd notion you were there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by the way he was in a fine temper because you had that sorreltopped lanternheaded mr <end> <end>

<start> <start> and when i do find him i swear to you that there will be no such i shuddered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all my life i had never known such a moment of indecision <end> <end>

<start> <start> the question had haunted me all the night and i had lost my way in consequence nor had the mornings ride from the widow browns sufficed to bring me to a decision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of what use to tell him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the woman loved him that had been clear to me yet by telling nick what i knew i might induce him to desist from his search and if i did not tell nick might some day run across the trail follow it up take riddles life and lose his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment made for confession as it was passed <end> <end>

<start> <start> well have a rare old time together though i have no doubt you can drink me under the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> egad davy you need only a woolsack to become a full fledged judge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now tell me how fortune has buffeted it was my second night without sleep for we sat burning candles in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wrights house until the dawn making up the time which we had lost away from each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when left to myself i was wont to slide into the commonplace and where my own dull life intrudes to clog the action i cut it down here and pare it away there until i am merely explanatory and not too much in evidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rode out the wilderness trail fell in with other travellers was welcomed by certain old familiar faces at harrodstown and pressed on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a vivid recollection of a beloved vigorous figure swooping out of a cabin door and scattering a brood of children right and left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said and she halted trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom she cried tom its davy come back and tom himself flew out of the door ramrod in one hand and rifle in the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never shall i forget them as they stood there he grinning with sheer joy as of yore and she with her hair flying and her blue gown snapping in the wind in a tremor between tears and laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i leaped to the ground and she hugged me in her arms as though i had been a child calling my name again and again and little tom pulling at the skirts of my coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i caught the youngster by the collar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> polly ann said i hes grown to what i was when and now its little davy no more she answered swept me a courtesy and added with a little quiver in my heart is still where it was said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was with them a fortnight in the familiar cabin and then i took up my journey northward heavy at leaving again but promising to see them from time to time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for tom was often at the falls when he went ascouting into the illinois country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as of old polly ann who ran the mill and was the real bread winner of the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louisville was even then bursting with importance and as i rode into it one bright november day i remembered the wilderness i had seen here not ten years gone when i had marched hither with captain harrods company to join clark on the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was even then a thriving little town of log and clapboard houses and schools and churches and wise men were saying of it what colonel clark had long ago predictedthat it would become the first city of commercial importance in the district of kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not mean to give you an account of my struggles that winter to obtain a foothold in the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time was a heyday for young barristers and troubles in those early days grew as plentifully in kentucky as corn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short i got a practice for colonel clark was here to help me and thanks to the men who had gone to kaskaskia and vincennes i had a fairly large acquaintance in kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> credes store which was famed for the glass windows which had been fetched all the way from philadelphia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crede was the embodiment of the enterprising spirit of the place and often of an evening he called me in to see the new fashionable things his barges had brought down the ohio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day certain young sparks would drop into my room to waylay the belles as they came to pick a costume to be worn at mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nickles dancing school or at the ball at fort finney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the winter slipped away and one cool evening in may there came a negro to my room with a note from colonel clark bidding me sup with him at the tavern and meet a celebrity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put on my best blue clothes that i had brought with me from richmond and repaired expectantly to the tavern about eight of the clock pushed through the curious crowd outside and entered the big room where the company was fast assembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> against the red blaze in the great chimneyplace i spied the figure of colonel clark more portly than of yore and beside him stood a gentleman who could be no other than general wilkinson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a man to fill the eye handsome of face symmetrical of figure easy of manner and he wore a suit of bottlegreen that became him admirably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short so fascinated and absorbed was i in watching him as he greeted this man and the other that i started as though something had pricked me when i heard my name called by colonel clark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come here davy he cried across the room and i came and stood abashed before the hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> general allow me to present to you the drummer boy of kaskaskia i hear that you drummed them to victory through a very hell of torture mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is an honor to grasp the hand of one who did such general wilkinson availed himself of that honor and encompassed me with a smile so benignant so winning in its candor that i could only mutter my acknowledgment and colonel clark must needs apologize laughing for my youth and timidity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie is not good at speeches general said he but i make no doubt he will drink a bumper to your health before we sit down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gentlemen he cried filling his glass from a bottle on the table a toast to general the company responded with a shout tossed off the toast and sat down at the long table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chance placed me between a young dandy from lexingtonone of several the general had brought in his trainand mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wharton a prominent planter of the neighborhood with whom i had a speaking acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a backwoods feast though served in something better than the old backwoods style and we had venison and bears meat and prairie fowl as well as pork and beef and breads that came stinging hot from the dutch ovens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toasts to this and that were flung back and forth and jests and gibes and the butt of many of these was that poor federal government which as one gentleman avowed was like a bantam hen trying to cover a nestful of turkeys eggs and clucking with importance all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this picture brought on gusts of laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what say you of the jay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried one what hisses greeted the name for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jay wished to enter into a treaty with spain agreeing to close the river for five and twenty years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel clark stood up and rapped on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gentlemen said he louisville has as her guest of honor tonight a man of whom kentucky may well be proud loud cheering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five years ago he favored lexington by making it his home and he came to us with the laurel of former achievements still clinging to his brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fought and suffered for his country and attained the honorable rank of major in the continental line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was chosen by the people of pennsylvania to represent them in the august body of their legislature and now he has got new honor in a new field renewed cheering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has come to kentucky to show her the way to prosperity and glory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kentucky had a grievance loud cries of yes yes! <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her hogs and cattle had no market her tobacco and agricultural products of all kinds were rotting because the spaniards had closed the mississippi to our traffic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could the federal government open the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said to the kentucky planters give your tobacco to me and i will sell it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put it in barges he floated down the river and as became a man of such distinction he was met by governor general miro on the levee at new orleans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where is that tobacco now gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel clark was here interrupted by such roars and stamping that he paused a moment and during this interval mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wharton leaned i stared at mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a man nearing the middle age with a lacing of red in his cheeks a pleasant gray eye and a singularly quiet manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thanks to the genius of general wilkinson colonel clark continued waving his hand towards the smilingly placid hero that tobacco has been deposited in the kings store at ten dollars per hundreda privilege heretofore confined to spanish subjects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well might wilkinson return from new orleans in a chariot and four to a grateful kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this year we have tripled nay quadrupled our crop of tobacco and we are here tonight to give thanks to the author of this prosperity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alas colonel clarks hand was not as steady as of yore and he spilled the liquor on the table as he raised his glass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gentlemen they drank it willingly and withal so lengthily and noisily that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wilkinson stood smiling and bowing for full three minutes before he could be heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a very paragon of modesty was the general and a man whose attitudes and expressions spoke as eloquently as his words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none looked at him now but knew before he opened his mouth that he was deprecating such an ovation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gentlemenmy friends and fellowkentuckians he said i thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindness but i assure you that i have done nothing worthy of it loud protests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a simple practical man who loves kentucky better than he loves himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is no virtue for we all have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have the misfortune to be governed by a set of worthy gentlemen who know little about kentucky and her wants and think less cries of ay ay! <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not decrying general washington and his cabinet it is but natural that the wants of the seaboard and the welfare and opulence of the eastern cities should be uppermost in their minds another interruption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kentucky if she would prosper must look to her own welfare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if any credit is due to me gentlemen it is because i reserved my decision of his excellency governorgeneral miro and his people until i saw them for myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little calm reason a plain statement of the case will often remove what seems an insuperable difficulty and i assure you that governor general miro is a most reasonable and courteous gentleman who looks with all kindliness and neighborliness on the people of kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us drink a toast to him to him your gratitude is due for he sends you word that in general wilkinsons barges said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wharton leaning over and subsiding again at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the general was the first to drink the toast and he sat down very modestly amidst a thunder of applause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man on the other side of me somewhat flushed leaped to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried what have they done for us indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before general wilkinson went to new orleans the spaniards seized our flat boats and cargoes and flung our traders into prison ay and sent them to the mines of brazil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the federal government takes sides with the indians against us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what has that government done for you colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he demanded turning to clark you who have won for them half of their territory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have cast you off like an old moccasin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the continental officers who fought in the east have halfpay for life or five years full pay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a swift vision came to me of a man young alert commanding stern under necessity selfrepressed at all timesa man who by the very dominance of his character had awed into submission the fierce northern tribes of a continent who had compelled men to follow him until the life had all but ebbed from their bodies who had led them to victory in the end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i remembered a boy who had stood awestruck before this man in the commandants house at fort sackville <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay and i heard again his words as though he had just spoken them promise me that you will not forget me if i am unfortunate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now because of a certain blinding of my eyes i did not see him clearly as he got slowly to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked around himi dare not sayvacantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then suddenly he spoke with a supreme anger and a supreme bitterness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a shilling has this government given me he cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> virginia was more grateful from her i have some acres of wild land anda sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sword gentlemen and not new at that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh a grateful government we serve one careful of the honor of her captains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gentlemen i stand today a discredited man because the honest debts i incurred in the service of that government are repudiated because my friends who helped it father gibault vigo and gratiot and others have never a dozen men had sprung clamoring to their feet before he sat down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one more excited than the rest got the ear of the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have them here with us tonight in this room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the contemptible enemies in kentucky who call themselves federalists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have fought once for our liberties let us fight again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us make a common cause with our real friends on the i rose sick at heart but every man was standing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then a strange thing happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw general wilkinson at the far end of the room his hand was raised and there was that on his handsome face which might have been taken for a smile and yet was not a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> others saw him too i know not by what exertion of magnetism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they looked at him and they held their tongues <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fear that we are losing our heads gentlemen he said and i propose to you the health of the first citizen of kentucky colonel george rogers clark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found myself out of the tavern and alone in the cool may night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as i walked slowly down the deserted street my head in a whirl a hand was laid on my shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned startled to face mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would speak a word with you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie he certainly sir i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that we walked along together in silence my own mind heavily occupied with what i had seen and heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> credes store went in at the picket gate beside it and down the path to my own door which i unlocked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt for the candle on the table lighted it and turned in surprise to discover that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wharton was poking up the fire and pitching on a log of wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flung off his greatcoat and sat down with his feet to the blaze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat down beside him and waited thinking him a sufficiently peculiar man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor particularly handsome he continued nor i agreed to this perforce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may thank god for it said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be a strange outpouring sir said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at me and smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what think you of this paragon general wilkinson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> egad said he well add caution to your lack of negative accomplishments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have had an eye on you this winter though you did not know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have made inquiries about you and hence i am not here tonight entirely through impulse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not made a fortune at the law but you have worked hard steered wide of astonished i merely nodded in reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not here to waste your time or steal your sleep he went on giving the log a push with his foot and i will come to the point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i first laid eyes on this fine gentleman general wilkinson i too fell a victim to his charms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on the eve of this epochmaking trip of which we heard so glowing an account tonight and i made up my mind that no spaniard however wily could resist his persuasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said to me wharton give me your crop of tobacco and i promise you to sell it in spite of all the royal mandates that go out of madrid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went he saw he conquered the obdurate miro as he has apparently conquered the rest of the world and he actually came back in a chariot and four as befitted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a heavy crop of tobacco was raised in kentucky that year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i helped to raise it added mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave the general my second crop and he sent it down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie i have to this day never received a piastre for my merchandise nor am i the only planter in this my astonishment somewhat prevented me from replying to this too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wharton meant to sue the general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remembered how inconspicuous he had named me and hope died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wharton did not look at me but stared into the fire for he was plainly not a man to rail and rant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie you are young but mark my words that man wilkinson will bring kentucky to ruin if he is not found out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole district from crab orchard to bear grass is mad about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even clark makes a fool colonel clark sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you have some hot blood he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so do i or i should not have been there tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the treatment he has had would bring a blush of shame to the cheek of any nation save a republic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in george rogers clark they have thrown away a general who might some day have decided the fate of this country they have left to stagnate a man fit to lead a nation to war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he is ready to intrigue against the government with any adventurer mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wharton i said rising did you come here to but mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wharton continued to stare into the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like you the better for it my dear sir said he and i assure you that i mean no offence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel clark is enshrined in our hearts democrats and federalists alike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever he may do we shall love him always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed which was as near a vigorous expression as he got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i too am a federalist a friend of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> humphrey marshall and as you know we are sadly in the minority in kentucky now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came here tonight to ask you to undertake a mission in behalf of myself and certain other gentlemen and i assure you that my motives are not wholly mercenary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused smiled and put the tips of his fingers together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would willingly lose every crop for the next ten years to convict this wilkinson of treason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie answered the planter i gave you credit for some shrewdness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you suppose the federal government does not realize the danger of this situation in kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have tried in vain to open the mississippi and are too weak to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this man wilkinson goes down to see miro and miro straightway opens the river to us through him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do you suppose wilkinson i said something i know not what as the light began to dawn on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i added i had not thought ah replied mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now you may easily imagine that general wilkinson has come to a very pretty arrangement with miro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a certain stipulated sum best known to wilkinson and miro general wilkinson agrees gradually to detach kentucky from the union and join it to his catholic majestys dominion of louisiana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bribethe opening of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the government could not do wilkinson did by the lifting mind you he said we have no proof of this and that is my reason for coming here tonight mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you want me i said bewildered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i repeat that you are not handsomei think he emphasized this undulythat you are selfeffacing inconspicuous in short you are not a man to draw suspicion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might travel anywhere and scarcely be noticedi have observed that about you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in addition to this you are wary you are discreet you are painstaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ask you to go first to st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis in louisiana territory and this for two reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first because it will draw any chance suspicion from your real objective new orleans and second because it is necessary to get letters to new orleans from such leading citizens of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis as colonel chouteau and monsieur gratiot and i will give you introductions to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are then to take passage to new orleans in a barge of furs which monsieur gratiot is sending down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mind we do not expect that you will obtain proof that miro is paying wilkinson money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you do so much the better but we believe that both are too sharp to leave any tracks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will make a report however upon the conditions under which our tobacco is being received and of all other matters which you may i had made up my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i will go i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wharton but with no more enthusiasm than he had previously shown i thought i had not misjudged you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is your law business so onerous that i laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i could settle what affairs i have by noon mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie i like your manner said he and he sat with me half an hour longer carefully reviewing his instructions and then he left me to a night of contemplation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by eleven oclock the next morning i had wound up my affairs having arranged with a young lawyer of my acquaintance to take over such cases as i had and i was busy in my room packing my saddlebags for the journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the warm scents of spring were wafted through the open door and window smells of the damp earth giving forth the green things and tender shades greeted my eyes when i paused and raised my head to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> purple buds littered the black ground before my doorstep and against the living green of the grass i saw the red stain of a robins breast as he hopped spasmodically hither and thither now pausing immovable with his head raised now tossing triumphantly a wriggling worm from the sod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he flew away and i heard a voice from the street side that brought me stark upright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hold there neighbor can you direct me to the there was no mistaking that voiceit was nicholas temples <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard a laugh and an answer the gate slammed and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple himself in a long gray riding coat booted and spurred stood before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy he cried come out here and hug me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why and if you were i answered you could not have at jonesboro acting the gallant with the widow winning and losing skins and cowbells and land at rattle andsnap horseracing with that wild mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith he near shot the top of my head off because i beat him at i laughed despite my anxiety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not heard how sevier got off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> egad that was a crowning stroke of genius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cozby and evans captains greene and gibson and seviers two boys whom you met on the nollichucky rode over the mountains to morganton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greene and gibson and seviers boys hid themselves with the horses in a clump outside the town while cozby and evans disguised as bumpkins in hunting shirts jogged into the town with seviers racing mare between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they jogged into the town i say through the crowds of white trash and rode up to the courthouse where sevier was being tried for his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evans stood at the open door and held the mare and gaped while cozby stalked in and shouldered his way to the front within four feet of the bar like a big awkward countryman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack sevier saw him and he saw evans with the mare outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then by thunder cozby takes a step right up to the bar and cries out judge arent you about done with that man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith it was like judgment day such a mixup as there was after that and nollichucky jack made three leaps and got on the mare and in the confusion cozby and evans were off too and the whole state of north carolina couldnt catch em then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id have given my soul to have been there he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come in said i for lack of something better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cursed if you havent given me a sweet reception davy said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you lost your practice or is there a lady here you rogue and he poked into the cupboard with his stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hullo where are you going now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added his eye falling on the saddlebags <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had it on my lips to say and then i remembered mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going on a journey said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i leave in about an hour said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i leave too he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean that i will go with you said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i shall be gone three months or more i protested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have nothing to do said nick placidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a vague trouble had been working in my mind but now the full horror of it dawned upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple and harry riddle were gone there so polly ann had avowed and nick could not help meeting riddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sorely beset i bent over to roll up a shirt and refrained from answering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came and laid a hand on my shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the devil ails you davy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it is an elopement of course i wont press you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im hanged it is no elopement i retorted my face growing hot in spite of myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i go with you said he for i vow you need taking care of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant put me off i say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but never in my life have i had such a reception and from my own i was in a quandary so totally unforeseen was this situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then a glimmer of hope came to me that perhaps his mother and riddle might not be in st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i recalled the conversation in the cabin and reflected that this wayward pair had stranded on so many beaches had drifted off again on so many tides that one place could scarce hold them long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perchance they had sunkwho could tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned to nick who stood watching me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not that i did not want you i said you must believe that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have wanted you ever since that night long ago when i slipped out of your bed and ran away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going first to st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis and then to new orleans on a mission of much delicacy a mission that requires discretion and secrecy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may come with all my heart with one condition onlythat you do not ask done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy i was always sure of you you are the one fixed quantity in my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis eh and to new orleans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> egad what havoc well make among the creole girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill run to the inn said nick and be back in ten minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got as far as the door slapped his thigh who <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked with a catch of my breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry riddle he answered and if so may god he ran down the path the gate clicked and i heard him whistling in the street on his way to the inn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after dinner we rode down to the ferry nick on the thoroughbred which had beat mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacksons horse and his man benjy on a scraggly pony behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> benjy was a small black negro with a very squat nose alert and talkative save when nick turned on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> benjy had been born at temple bow he worshipped his master and all that pertained to him and he showered upon me all the respect and attention that was due to a member of the temple family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this i was very grateful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have been an easier journey had we taken a boat down to fort massac but such a proceeding might have drawn too much attention to our expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no space to describe that trip overland which reminded me at every stage of the march against kaskaskia the woods the chocolate streams the coffeecolored swamps flecked with dead leavesand at length the prairies the grass not waisthigh now but young and tender giving forth the acrid smell of spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made me recount every detail of my trials as a drummer boy or kept me in continuous spells of laughter over his own escapades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short i began to realize that we were as near to each other as though we had never been parted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we looked down upon kaskaskia from the selfsame spot where i had stood on the bluff with colonel clark and the sounds were even then the samethe sweet tones of the church bell and the lowing of the cattle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found a few virginians and pennsylvanians scattered in amongst the french the forerunners of that change which was to come over this country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we spent the night with my old friend father gibault still the faithful pastor of his flock cheerful though the savings of his lifetime had never been repaid by that country to which he had given his allegiance so freely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> travelling by easy stages on the afternoon of the second day after leaving kaskaskia we picked our way down the high bluff that rises above the american bottom and saw below us that yellow monster among the rivers the mississippi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a blind monster he seemed searching with troubled arms among the islands for his bed swept onward by an inexorable force and on his heaving shoulders he carried great trees pilfered from the unknown forests of the north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down in the moist and shady bottom we came upon the log hut of a halfbreed trapper and he agreed to ferry us across <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for our horses a keel boat must be sent after these and monsieur gratiot would no doubt easily arrange for this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so we found ourselves about five oclock on that saturday evening embarked in a wide pirogue on the current dodging the driftwood avoiding the eddies and drawing near to a village set on a low bluff on the spanish side and gleaming white among the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as i looked the thought came again like a twinge of pain that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple and riddle might be there thinking themselves secure in this spot so removed from the world and its doings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how now my man of mysterious affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried nick from the bottom of the boat you are as puckered as a sour persimmon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you a treaty with spain in your nothing if you do not i answered smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord send we dont admire the same lady then said nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pierrot he cried turning to one of the boatmen the man missed a stroke in his astonishment and the boat swung lengthwise in the swift current <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dame monsieur il y en a he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where did you learn french nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mason had it hammered into me he answered carelessly his eyes on the line of keel boats moored along the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our guides shot the canoe deftly between two of these the prow grounded in the yellow mud and we landed on spanish territory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we looked about us while our packs were being unloaded and the place had a strange flavor in that year of our lord  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a swarthy boatman in a tow shirt with a bright handkerchief on his head stared at us over the gunwale of one of the keel boats and spat into the still yellow water three highcheeked indians with smudgy faces and dirty red blankets regarded us in silent contempt and by the waterside above us was a sled loaded with a huge water cask a bony mustang pony between the shafts and a chanting negro dipping gourdfuls from the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a road slanted up the little limestone bluff and above and below us stone houses could be seen nestling into the hill houses higher on the river side and with galleries there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we climbed the bluff benjy at our heels with the saddlebags and found ourselves on a yellowclay street lined with grass and wild flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great peace hung over the village an air of a different race a restfulness strange to a kentuckian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clematis and honeysuckle climbed the high palings and behind the privacy of these low bigchimneyed houses of limestone weathered gray could be seen their roofs sloping in gentle curves to the shaded porches in front or again houses of posts set upright in the ground and these filled between with plaster and so immaculately whitewashed that they gleamed against the green of the trees which shaded them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind the houses was often a kind of pinkandcream paradise of flowering fruit trees so dear to the french settlers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were vineyards too and thrifty patches of vegetables and lines of flowers set in the carefully raked mould <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we walked on enraptured by the sights around us by the heavy scent of the roses and the blossoms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was a quaint stone horsemill a stable or a barn set uncouthly on the street a bakers shop with a glimpse of the white capped baker through the shaded doorway and an appetizing smell of hot bread in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little farther on we heard the tinkle of the blacksmiths hammer and the man himself looked up from where the hoof rested on his leather apron to give us a kindly bon soir messieurs as we passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here was a cabaret with the inevitable porch from whence came the sharp click of billiard balls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we walked on stopping now and again to peer between the palings when we heard amidst the rattling of a cart a cheval a cheval pour aller voir ma mie a shaggy indian pony came ambling around the corner between the long shafts of a charette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a bareheaded young man in tow shirt and trousers was driving and three laughing girls were seated on the stools in the cart behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly before i quite realized what had happened the young man pulled up the pony the girls fell silent and nick was standing in the middle of the road with his hat in his hand bowing elaborately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> je vous salue mesdemoiselles he cried mes anges a charabanc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pouvezvous me diriger chez monsieur sapristi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the young man but he laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young women stood up giggling and peered at nick over the young mans shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them wore a fresh redandwhite calamanco gown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a complexion of ivory tinged with red raven hair and dusky longlashed mischievous eyes brimming with merriment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> volontiers monsieur she answered before the others could catch their breath premiere droite et premiere gauche <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried tapping the young gaspard came to himself flicked the pony and they went off down the road with shouts of laughter while nick stood waving his hat until they turned the corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> egad said he id take to the highway if i could be sure of holding up such a cargo every time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> off with you benjy and find out where she lives he cried and the obedient benjy dropped the saddlebags as though such commands were not uncommon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pick up those bags benjy said i laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> benjy glanced uncertainly at his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do as i tell you you black scalawag said nick or marse dave began benjy rolling his eyes in discomfiture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look you nick temple said i when you shipped with me you promised that i should command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant afford to have the town about our ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh very well if you put it that way said nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little honest diversion pick up the bags benjy obeying mademoiselles directions we trudged on until we came to a comfortable stone house surrounded by trees and set in a halfblock bordered by a sevenfoot paling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hardly had we opened the gate when a tall gentleman of grave demeanor and sober dress rose from his seat on the porch and i recognized my friend of cahokia days monsieur gratiot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a little more portly his hair was dressed now in an eelskin and he looked every inch the man of affairs that he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he greeted us kindly and bade us come up on the porch where he read my letter of introduction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why he exclaimed immediately giving me a cordial grasp of the hand of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strategist the john law the reader of character of colonel clarks and why worse sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you predicted that congress would never repay me it was not such a little loan monsieur i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nimporte said he i went to richmond with my box of scrip and promissory notes but i was not ill repaid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i did not get my money i acquired at least a host of distinguished acquaintances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur gratiot looked at him fixedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked and a sudden vague fear seized me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said nick now they are become a worthless lot of refugees and outlaws who by good fortune have before monsieur gratiot could answer a child came running around the corner of the house and stood surprised staring at us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nick made a face stooped down and twirled his finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shouting with a terrified glee the boy fled to the garden path nick after him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the revolution ruined many familieshis was one i answered with what firmness of tone i could muster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then nick came back carrying the shouting youngster on his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that instant a lady appeared in the doorway leading another child and we were introduced to madame gratiot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gentlemen said monsieur gratiot you must make my house your home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fear your visit will not be as long as i could wish mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie he added turning to me if mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have an engagement to have my furs in new orleans by a certain time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am late in loading and as there is a moon i am sending off my boats tomorrow night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the we were fortunate to come in such good season i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a delicious supper of gumbo a creole dish of fricassee of creme brule of red wine and fresh wild strawberries we sat on the porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crickets chirped in the garden the moon cast fantastic shadows from the pecan tree on the grass while nick struggling with his french talked to madame gratiot and now and then their gay laughter made monsieur gratiot pause and smile as he talked to me of my errand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed strange to me that a man who had lost so much by his espousal of our cause should still be faithful to the american republic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although he lived in louisiana he had never renounced the american allegiance which he had taken at cahokia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he regarded with no favor the pretensions of spain toward kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and remarkably enough he looked forward even then to the day when louisiana would belong to the republic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie said he the most casual student of your race must come to the same conclusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have seen for yourself how they have overrun and conquered kentucky and the cumberland districts despite a hideous warfare waged by all the tribes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your people will not be denied and when they get to louisiana they will take it he was a man strong in argument was monsieur gratiot for he loved it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay he said finally spain might as well try to dam the mississippi as to dam your commerce on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for france i love her though my people were exiled to switzerland by the edict of nantes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but france is rotten through the prodigality of her kings and nobles and she cannot hold louisiana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kingdom is sunk in debt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for this wilkinson of whom you speak i know something of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no doubt that miro pensions him but i know miro likewise and you will obtain no proof of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will however discover in new orleans many things of interest to your government and to the federal party in kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel chouteau and i will give you letters to certain french gentlemen in new orleans who can be trusted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is saintgre for instance who puts a french louisiana into his prayers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has never forgiven oreilly and his spaniards for the murder of his father in sixtynine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> saintgre is a good fellowa cousin of the present marquis in franceand his ancestors held many positions of trust in the colony under the french regime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he entertains lavishly at les iles his plantation on the mississippi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has the gossip of new orleans at his tongues tip and you will be suspected of nothing save a desire to amuse yourselves if you go there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused interrupted by the laughter of the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when strangers of note or of position drift here and pass on to new orleans i always give them letters to saintgre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he monsieur gratiot produced his tabatiere and took a pinch of snuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i summoned my courage for the topic which had trembled all the evening on my lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some years ago monsieur gratiot a lady and a gentleman were rescued on the wilderness trail in monsieur gratiot leaned forward quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must have been the clives he cried it can have been no other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell mea woman still beautiful commanding of perhaps eight and thirty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a woman who had a sorrow?a great sorrow though we have never learned it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clive a man of fashion ill content yes i said eagerly my voice sinking near to a monsieur gratiot took another pinch of snuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it it is curious that you should mention them for i gave them letters to new orleansamongst others to saint gre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur clive talked of nothing but paris where they had lived once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at last she gave in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is more than a year ago he continued seeming not to notice my emotion they went by way of new orleans in one of chouteaus boats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clive sunday came with the soft haziness of a june morning and the dew sucked a fresh fragrance from the blossoms and the grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked out of our window at the orchard all pink and white in the early sun and across a patch of clover to the stone kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pearly feathery smoke was wafted from the chimney a delicious aroma of creole coffee pervaded the odor of the blossoms and a cotton clad negro a pieds nus came down the path with two steaming cups and knocked at our door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he who has tasted creole coffee will never forget it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the effect of it was lost upon nick for he laid down the cup sighed and promptly went to sleep again while i dressed and went forth to make his excuses to the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found monsieur and madame with their children walking among the flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is charming your cousin said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let him sleep by all means until after mass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you must come with us to madame chouteaus my mothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her madame chouteau my motherinlaw is the queen regent of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are all afraid of her and i warn you that she is a very determined and formidable personage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is the widow of the founder of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis the sieur laclede although she prefers her own name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rules us with a strong hand dispenses justice settles disputes and you will see a very pretty french custom of submission to parents said madame gratiot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may seem very strange to you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie but we believe that sunday was made to enjoy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will have time to attend the ball before you send them down the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she added mischievously turning to her husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly said he the loading will not be finished presently madame gratiot went off to mass while i walked with monsieur gratiot to a storehouse near the rivers bank whence the skins neatly packed and numbered were being carried to the boats on the sweating shoulders of the negroes the halfbreeds and the canadian boatmenbulky bales of yellow elk from the upper plains of the missouri of buffalo and deer and bear and priceless little packages of the otter and the beaver trapped in the green shade of the endless northern forests and brought hither in pirogues down the swift river by the red tribesmen and canadian adventurers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwards i strolled about the silent village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a private of the spanish louisiana regiment in a dirty uniform slouched behind the palings in front of the commandants quartersa quaint stone house set against the hill with dormer windows in its curving roof with a wide porch held by eight sturdy hewn pillars here and there the muffled figure of a prowling indian loitered or a barefooted negress shuffled along by the fence crooning a folksong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the world had obeyed the call of the church bell save theseand nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bethought myself of nick and made my way back to monsieur gratiots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found my cousin railing at benjy who had extracted from the saddlebags a wondrous gray suit of london cut in which to array his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clothes became nicks slim figure remarkably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this coat was cut away smartly like a uniform towards the tails and was brought in at the waist with an infinite art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i exclaimed but you have slept through the best part is to come said nick giving a final touch to his neckband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> followed by benjys adoring eyes he started out of the door and i followed him perforce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we came to the little church of upright logs and plaster with its crudely shingled peaked roof with its tiny belfry crowned by a cross with its porches on each side shading the line of windows there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside the church a little at the back was the cures modest house of stone and at the other hand under spreading trees the graveyard with its rough wooden crosses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and behind these graves rose the wooded hill that stretched away towards the wilderness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a span of life had been theirs who rested here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their youth perchance had been spent amongst the crooked streets of some french village streets lined by redtiled houses and crossing limpid streams by quaint bridges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> death had overtaken them beside a monster tawny river of which their imaginations had not conceived a river which draws tribute from the remote places of an unknown landa river indeed which mixing all the waters seemed to symbolize a coming race which was to conquer the land by its resistless flow even as the mississippi bore relentlessly towards the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were my own thoughts as i listened to the tones of the priest as they came droningly out of the door while nick was exchanging jokes in doubtful french with some halfbreeds leaning against the palings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we heard benches scraping on the floor and the congregation began to file out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who reached the steps gave back respectfully and there came an elderly lady in a sober turban a black mantilla wrapped tightly about her shoulders and i made no doubt that she was monsieur gratiots motherinlaw madame chouteau she whom he had jestingly called the queen regent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sure of this when i saw madame gratiot behind her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame chouteau indeed had the face of authority a highbridged nose a determined chin a mouth that shut tightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame gratiot presented us to her mother and as she passed on to the gate madame chouteau reminded us that we were to dine with her at two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after her the congregation the welltodo and the poor alike poured out of the church and spread in merry groups over the grass keel boatmen in tow shirts and partycolored worsted belts the blacksmith the shoemaker the farmer of a small plot in the common fields in large cotton pantaloons and lightwove camlet coat the more favored in skullcaps linen smallclothes cotton stockings and silverbuckled shoesevery man pausing dipping into his tabatiere for a word with his neighbor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the women too made a picture strange to our eyes the matrons in jacket and petticoat a madras handkerchief flung about their shoulders the girls in fresh cottonade or calamanco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all at once cries of polyte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were heard and a nimble young man with a jesterlike face hopped around the corner of the church trundling a barrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind polyte came two rotund little men perspiring freely and laden down with various articlesa birdcage with two yellow birds a hattrunk an inlaid card box a roll of scarlet cloth and i know not what else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they deposited these on the grass beside the barrel which polyte had set on end and proceeded to mount encouraged by the shouts its an auction i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but nick did not hear me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed his glance to the far side of the circle and my eye was caught by a red ribbon a blush that matched it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a glance shot from underneath long lashesbut not for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside the girl and palpably uneasy stood the young man who had been called gaspard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but nick had pulled off his hat and was sweeping her a bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl looked down smoothing her ribbon gaspard took a step forward and other young women near us tittered with delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the voice of hippolyte rolling his mssieurs et mesdames ce sont des effets dun pauvre officier qui est mort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he opened the hattrunk produced an antiquated beaver with a gold cord and surveyed it with a covetousness that was admirably feigned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mssieurs to own such a hat were a patent of nobility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> am i bid there was a loud laughter and he was bid four <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gaspard cried the auctioneer addressing the young man of the tumbrel suzanne would no longer hesitate if she saw you in such a hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowd howled suzanne simpered and gaspard turned as pink as clover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was not to be bullied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hat was sold to an elderly person the red cloth likewise a pot of grease went to a housewife and there was a veritable scramble for the box of playing cards and at last hippolyte held up the wooden cage with the fluttering yellow birds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried his eyes on gaspard once more a gentle presenta present to make a heart relent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and monsieur leon perchance you will make a bid although instantly from somewhere under the barrel a cock crew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the yellow birds looked surprised and as for polyte he nearly dropped the cage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was impassive but suddenly i remembered his boyhood gift how he had imitated the monkeys and i began to shake with inward laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said an old man at last searching with an uncertain hand for his snuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur cried nick to the auctioneer i will make a bid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but first you must tell me whether they are cocks parbleu answered the puzzled hippolyte that i do everybody looked at nick including suzanne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well said he i will make a bid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if they turn out to be gamecocks i will fight them with monsieur there was a laugh as of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried gaspard and his voice broke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mssieurs he shouted they are from the canaries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another laugh and gaspard wiped the perspiration from his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said nick and the villagers turned to him in wonderment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what could such a fine monsieur want with two yellow birds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> en avant gaspard said hippolyte and suzanne shot another barbed glance in our direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten cried hippolyte i am offered ten livres for the yellow birds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no appeals entreaties or taunts could persuade him to bid more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at length hippolyte with a gesture of disdain handed nick the cage as though he were giving it away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur he said the birds are yours since there are no more lovers who are worthy of the name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they monsieur answered nick it is to disprove that statement that i have bought the birds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle he added turning to the flushing suzanne i pray that you will accept this present with every assurance of my mademoiselle took the cage and amidst the laughter of the village at the discomfiture of poor gaspard swept nick a frightened courtesyone that nevertheless was full of coquetry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at that instant to cap the situation a rotund little man with a round face under a linen biretta grasped nick by the hand and cried in painful but sincere monsieur you mek my daughter ver happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she want those bird ever sence captain lopez he die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur i am jean baptiste lenoir colonel chouteaus miller and if monsieur will lead the way said nick instantly taking the little man by the arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you are to dine at madame chouteaus i expostulated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plus tard mademoiselle nous danserons plus what devil inhabits you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said when i had got him started on the way to madame chouteaus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your own at present davy he answered laying a hand on my shoulder else i should be on the way to the pon with lenoir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the ball is to come and he executed several steps in anticipation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i demanded though feeling a little self commiseration also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will never know how to enjoy yourself said he with conviction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame chouteau lived in a stone house wide and low surrounded by trees and gardens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a pretty tribute of respect her children and grandchildren paid her that day in accordance with the old french usage of honoring the parent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like to linger on the scene and tell how nick made them all laugh over the story of suzanne lenoir and the yellow birds and how the children pressed around him and made him imitate all the denizens of wood and field amid deafening shrieks of delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have probably delayed gaspards wooing another year mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suzanne is a sad coquette said colonel auguste chouteau laughing as we set out for the ball <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was hanging low over the western hills as we approached the barracks and out of the open windows came the merry mad sounds of violin guitar and flageolet the tinkle of a triangle now and then the shouts of laughter the shuffle of many feet over the puncheons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within the door smiling and benignant unmindful of the stifling atmosphere sat the blackrobed village priest talking volubly to an elderly man in a scarlet cap and several stout ladies ranged along the wall beyond them on a platform zeron the baker fiddled as though his life depended on it the perspiration dripping from his brow frowning gesticulating at them with the flageolet and the triangle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in a dim noisy heated whirl the whole village went round and round and round under the low ceiling in the valse young and old rich and poor high and low the sound of their laughter and the scraping of their feet cut now and again by an agonized squeak from zerons fiddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from time to time a staggering panting couple would fling themselves out help themselves liberally to pink sirop from the bowl on the side table and then fling themselves in once more until zeron stopped from sheer exhaustion to tune up for a pas de deux <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across the room by the sirop bowl a pair of red ribbons flaunted a pair of eyes sent a swift challenge zeron and his assistants struck up again and there in a corner was nick temple with characteristic effrontery attempting a pas de deux with suzanne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though nick was ignorant he was not ungraceful and the village laughed and admired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when zeron drifted back into a valse he seized suzannes plump figure in his arms and bore her unresisting like a prize among the dancers avoiding alike the fat and unwieldy the clumsy and the spiteful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a while the tune held its mad pace and ended with a shriek and a snap on a high note for zeron had broken a string <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amid a burst of laughter from the far end of the room i saw nick stop before an open window in which a prying indian was framed swing suzanne at arms length and bow abruptly at the brave with a grunt that startled him into life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would gain suzanne for a dance only to have her snatched away at the next by the slim and reckless young gentleman in the gray court clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little nick cared that the affair soon became the amusement of the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from time to time as he glided past with suzanne on his shoulder he nodded gayly to colonel chouteau or made a long face at me and to save our souls we could not help laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl has met her match for she has played shuttle cock with all the hearts in the village said monsieur chouteau <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but perhaps it is just as well that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have signed a bon mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie by which you can obtain money at new orleans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and do not forget to present our letter to monsieur de saint gre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has a daughter by the way who will be more of a the evening faded into twilight with no signs of weariness from the dancers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and presently there stood beside us jean baptiste lenoir the colonels miller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bsoir monsieur le colonel he said touching his skull cap the water is very low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you fren he added turning he is going away tonightin an hour or so i answered with thanksgiving in my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry said monsieur lenoir politely but his looks belied his words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peut etre he marry her but i think not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i come away from france to escape the fine gentlemen long time ago they how long ago did you come from france monsieur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked to get away from an uncomfortable subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is twenty years said he dreamily in french <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was born in the quartier saint jean on the harbor of the city of marseilles near notre dame de la nativite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he told of a tall uneven house of four stories with a high pitched roof and a little barred door and window at the bottom giving out upon the rough cobbles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke of the smell of the sea of the rollicking sailors who surged through the narrow street to embark on his majestys men ofwar and of the kings white soldiers in ranks of four going to foreign lands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how he had become a farmer the tenant of a country family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excitement grew on him and he mopped his brow with his blue rumal handkerchief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they desire all the nobles he cried i make the land good and they seize it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i marry a pretty wife and monsieur le comte he want her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lbon dieu he added bitterly relapsing into french <end> <end> 
<start> <start> france is for the king and the nobility monsieur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor have but little chance there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the country i have seen the peasants eat roots and in the city the poor devour the refuse from the houses of the rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was we who paid for their luxuries and with mine own eyes i have seen their gilded coaches ride down weak men and women in the streets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will murder louis and burn the great chateaux <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i who speak to you am of the people monsieur the sun had long set and with flint and tow they were touching the flame to the candles which flickered transparent yellow in the deepening twilight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so absorbed had i become in listening to lenoirs description that i had forgotten nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i searched for him among the promenading figures and missed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain did i seek for a glimpse of suzannes red ribbons and i grew less and less attentive to the millers reminiscences and arraignments of the nobility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had nick indeed run away with his daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dancing went on with unabated zeal and through the open door in the fainting azure of the sky the summer moon hung above the hills like a great yellow orange <end> <end> 
<start> <start> striving to hide my uneasiness i made my farewells to madame chouteaus sons and daughters and their friends and with colonel chouteau i left the hall and began to walk towards monsieur gratiots hoping against hope that nick had gone there to change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we had scarce reached the road before we could see two figures in the distance hazily outlined in the midlight of the departed sun and the coming moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first was monsieur gratiot himself the second benjy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur gratiot took me by the hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i regret to inform you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie said he politely that my keel boats are loaded and ready to leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were you on any other errand i should implore you to stay with is temple at your house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why no said monsieur gratiot i thought he was where is your master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint seed him marse dave sence i put him inter he has gone off with the girl put in colonel chouteau laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said with growing anger at this lack of consideration on nicks part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill warrant that gaspard or hippolyte beaujais will know if they can be found said the colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither as we hurried back towards the throbbing sounds of zerons fiddle i apologized as best i might to monsieur gratiot declaring that if nick were not found within the halfhour i would leave without him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my host protested that an hour or so would make no difference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were about to pass through the group of loungers that loitered by the gate when the sound of rapid footsteps arrested us and we turned to confront two panting and perspiring young men who halted beside us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one was hippolyte beaujais more fantastic than ever as he faced the moon and the other was gaspard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had plainly made a common cause but it was hippolyte who spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur he cried you seek your friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said colonel chouteau repressing another laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the pond monsieurin a boat monsieur with suzanne monsieur le colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and moreover he will parbleu said the colonel i should think not for any arguments that you two could muster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we will how far is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked thinking of monsieur gratiot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about a mile said colonel chouteau a pleasant we stepped out hippolyte and gaspard running in front the colonel and monsieur gratiot and myself following and a snicker which burst out now and then told us that benjy was in the rear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on any other errand i should have thought the way beautiful for the country road rutted by wooden wheels wound in and out through pleasant vales and over gentle rises whence we caught glimpses from time to time of the mississippi gleaming like molten gold to the eastward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there nestling against the gentle slopes of the hillside clearing was a lowthatched farmhouse among its orchards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we walked nicks escapade instead of angering monsieur gratiot seemed to present itself to him in a more and more ridiculous aspect and twice he nudged me to call my attention to the two vengefully triumphant figures silhouetted against the moon ahead of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from time to time also i saw colonel chouteau shaking with laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for me it was impossible to be angry at nick for any space <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody else would have carried off a girl in the face of her rivals for a moonlight row on a pond a mile away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length we began to go down into the valley where chouteaus pond was and we caught glimpses of the shimmering of its waters through the trees ay and presently heard them tumbling lightly over the milldam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spot was made for romancea sequestered vale clad with forest trees cleared a little by the waterside where monsieur lenoir raised his maize and his vegetables <end> <end> 
<start> <start> below the mill so monsieur gratiot told me where the creek lay in pools on its limestone bed the village washing was done and every monday morning barelegged negresses strode up this road the bundles of clothes balanced on their heads the paddles in their hands followed by a stream of black urchins who tempted providence to drown them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down in the valley we came to a path that branched from the road and led under the oaks and hickories towards the pond and we had not taken twenty paces in it before the notes of a guitar and the sound of a voice reached our ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then when the six of us stood huddled in the rank growth at the waters edge we saw a boat floating idly in the forest shadow on the far side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put my hand to my mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came for an answer with the careless and thine eyes are bright as the stars at night helas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed hippolyte sadly there is no nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouted again reenforced vociferously by the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the music ceased there came feminine laughter across go away and amuse yourselves at the dance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peste it is scarce an hour ago i threatened to row ashore and a scream of delight from suzanne followed this sally which was received by gaspard and hippolyte with a rattle of sacres anddespite our irritationthe colonel monsieur gratiot and myself with a burst of involuntary laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> parbleu said the colonel choking it is a pity to disturb such a one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gratiot if it was my boat id delay indeed i shall have had no small entertainment as a the tinkle of the guitar was heard again and nicks sposin i was to go to n oleans an take sick an die like a bird into the country my spirit would fly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go way old man and leave me alone there was a murmur of voices in the boat the sound of a paddle gurgling as it dipped and the dugout shot out towards the middle of the pond and drifted again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one might think new orleans was across the street the dugout was coming towards us now propelled by easy strokes and nick could be heard the while talking in low tones to suzanne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could only guess at the tenor of his conversation which ceased entirely as they drew near <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length the prow slid in among the rushes was seized vigorously by gaspard and hippolyte and the boat hauled ashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you very much messieurs you are most obliging said nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and taking suzanne by the hand he helped her gallantly over the gunwale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur he added turning in his most irresistible manner to monsieur gratiot if i have delayed the departure of your boat i am exceedingly sorry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i appeal to you if i have not and he bowed to suzanne who stood beside him coyly looking down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for polyte and gaspard they were quite breathless between rage and astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but colonel chouteau began to laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> diable monsieur you are right he cried and rather than have missed this entertainment i would pay au revoir mademoiselle said nick i will return when i am released from bondage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when this terrible mentor relaxes vigilance i will escape and make my way oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried mademoiselle to me you will let him assuredly mademoiselle i said but i have known him longer than you and i tell you that in a month he hippolyte gave a grunt of approval to this plain speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suzanne exclaimed but before nick could answer footsteps were heard in the path and lenoir himself perspiring panting exhausted appeared in the midst of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and turning to nick he added quite simply so monsieur you did not there was no place to run monsieur answered nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> praise be to god for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the miller heartily there is some advantage in living in the wilderness i shall come back and try monsieur said nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you that he will not monsieur i put in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thanked me profusely and suddenly an idea seemed to strike him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is the priest he cried monsieur le cure there was an awkward silence broken at length by an exclamation from gaspard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel chouteau turned his back and i saw his shoulders heave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all eyes were on nick but the rascal did not seem at all perturbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur he said bowing marriage is a serious thing and not to be entered into lightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thank you from my heart but i am bound now with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ritchie on an errand of such importance that i must make a sacrifice if mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temple wishes i began with malicious delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but nick took me by the shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear davy he said giving me a vicious kick i could not think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will go with you at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adieu mademoiselle said he bending over suzannes unresisting hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adieu messieurs and i thank you for your and now monsieur gratiot i have already presumed we left them lenoir suzanne and her two suitors standing at the pond and made our way through the path in the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not until we reached the road and had begun to climb out of the valley that the silence was broken between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur said colonel chouteau slyly do you it might have been closer said nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> assuredly said nick to the extent of abducting monsieur le cure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for you davy he added between it was well for us that the colonel and monsieur gratiot took the escapade with such good nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so we walked along through the summer night talking gayly until at length the lights of the village twinkled ahead of us and in the streets we met many parties making merry on their homeward way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we came to monsieur gratiots bade our farewells to madame picked up our saddlebags the two gentlemen escorting us down to the river bank where the keel boat was tugging at the ropes that held her impatient to be off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her captain a picturesque canadian by the name of xavier paret was presented to us we bade our friends farewell and stepped across the plank to the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we were casting off monsieur gratiot called to us that he would take the first occasion to send our horses back to kentucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the oars were manned the heavy hulk moved and we were shot out into the mighty current of the river on our way to new orleans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nick and i stood for a long time on the deck and the windows of the little village gleamed like stars among the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we passed the last of its houses that nestled against the hill and below that the forest lay like velvet under the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the song of our boatmen broke the silence of the night voici le temps et la saison voici le temps et la saison ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vrai que les journees sont longues we were embarked on a strange river in a strange boat and bound for a strange city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to us westerners a halo of romance of unreality hung over new orleans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to us it had an old world almost oriental flavor of mystery and luxury and pleasure and we imagined it swathed in the moisture of the delta built of quaint houses with courts of shining orange trees and magnolias and surrounded by flowering plantations of unimagined beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was most fitting that such a place should be the seat of dark intrigues against material progress and this notion lent added zest to my errand thither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for nick it took no great sagacity on my part to predict that he would forget suzanne and begin to look forward to the creole beauties of the mysterious city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first there was the furladen keel boat in which we travelled gone forever now from western navigation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had its rude square sail to take advantage of the river winds its mast strongly braced to hold the long towropes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but towropes were for the endless upriver journey when a numerous crew strained day after day along the bank chanting the voyageurs songs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now we were lightmanned two halfbreeds and two canadians to handle the oars in time of peril and captain xavier who stood aft on the cabin roof leaning against the heavy beam of the long curved tiller watching hawklike for snag and eddy and bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within the cabin was a great fireplace of stones where our cooking was done and bunks set round for the men in cold weather and rainy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in these fair nights we chose to sleep on deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far into the night we sat nick and i our feet dangling over the forward edge of the cabin looking at the glory of the moon on the vast river at the endless forest crown at the haze which hung like silver dust under the high bluffs on the american side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we awoke again as the moon was shrinking abashed before the light that glowed above these cliffs and the river was turned from brown to gold and then to burnished copper the forest to a thousand shades of green from crest to the banks where the river was licking the twisted roots to nakedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the south wind wafted the sharp woodsmoke from the chimney across our faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the stern xavier stood immovable against the tiller his short pipe clutched between his teeth the colors of his new worsted belt made gorgeous by the rising sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bjour michie he said and added in the english he had picked up from the british traders the breakfas he is ready and jean make him good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you have we went down the ladder into the cabin where the odor of the furs mingled with the smell of the cooking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a fricassee steaming on the crane some of zerons bread brought from st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis and coffee that monsieur gratiot had provided for our use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we took our bowls and cups on deck and sat on the edge of the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by gad cried nick it lacks but the one element and what is that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> xavier who overheard gave a delighted laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> parbleu michie you have right he said but michie nick got to his feet and if anything he did could have surprised me i should have been surprised when he put his arm coaxingly about xaviers neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> xavier himself was surprised and correspondingly delighted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me xavier he said with a look not to be beauties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed xavier la nouvelle orleans it is the home of beauty michie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they promenade themselves on the levee they look down from ze gallerie but mon dieu michie they are vair difficile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not like englis beauties there is the father and the mother andthe convent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and xavier who had a wen under his eye laid his finger on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for shame xavier cried nick and you are balked xavier thought this an exceedingly good joke and he took his pipe out of his mouth to laugh the better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet ze alcalde he mek me afraid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once he put me in ze calaboose when i tried nick roared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will show you how xavier he said as to climbing the balconies there is a convenance in it as in all else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance one must be daring and discreet and nimble and ready to give the law a presentable answer and lacking that a piastre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the fair one must be a fair one nay said nick i learned it all and much more xavier stared at me for an instant and considering that he knew nothing of my character i thought it extremely impolite of him to laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed he tried to control himself for some reason standing in awe of my appearance and then he burst out into such loud hawhaws that the crew poked their heads above the cabin hatch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> michie reetchie said xavier and again he burst into laughter that choked further speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he controlled himself and laid his finger on his wen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont believe it said nick offended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an incurable said nick an amazingly clever rogue at device when there is a petticoat in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> davy do i do xavier roared again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> xavier said nick gently taking the tiller out of his mon dieu said xavier and who is to pay michie volontiers michie as we go now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there come a time when i even i who am twenty year on her do not know whether it is right or left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ze snag he grip you like dat and xavier twined his strong arms around nick until he was helpless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ze barhe hol you by ze leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an who is to tell you how far he run under ze yellow water michie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i who speak to you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i know not how i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said nick pushing him away i xavier laughed and sat down on the edge of the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nick took easily to accomplishments and he handled the clumsy tiller with a certainty and distinction that made the boatmen swear in two languages and a patois <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great waterlogged giant of the northern forests loomed ahead of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> xavier sprang to his feet but nick had swung his boat swiftly smoothly into the deeper water on the outer side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> saint jacques michie cried xavier you mek him fascinated by a new accomplishment nick held to the tiller while xavier with a trained eye scanned the troubled yellowglistening surface of the river ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind died the sun beat down with a moist and venomous sting and northeastward above the edge of the bluff a bank of cloud like sulphur smoke was lifted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gradually xavier ceased his jesting and became quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looks like a hurricane said nick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mon dieu said xavier you have right michie and he called in his rapid patois to the crew who lounged forward in the cabins shade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came to my mind the memory of that hurricane at temple bow long ago a storm that seemed to have brought so much sorrow into my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i glanced at nick but his face was serene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cloudbank came on in black and yellow masses and the saffron light i recalled so well turned the living green of the forest to a sickly pallor and the yellow river to a tinge scarce to be matched on earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> xavier had the tiller now and the men were straining at the oars to send the boat across the current towards the nearer western shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as my glance took in the scale of things the miles of bluff frowning above the bottom the river that seemed now like a lake of lava gently boiling and the wilderness of the western shore that reached beyond the ken of man i could not but shudder to think of the conflict of natures forces in such a place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a grim stillness reigned over all broken only now and again by a sharp command from xavier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men were rowing for their lives the sweat glistening on their red faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked not to the northeast whence the banks of cloud had risen but to the southwest and it seemed as though a little speck was there against the hurrying film of cloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were drawing near the forest line where a little creek made an indentation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i listened and from afar came a sound like the strumming of low notes on a guitar and sad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the terrified scream of a panther broke the silence of the forest and then the other distant note grew stronger and stronger yet and rose to a high hum like unto no sound on this earth and mingled with it now was a lashing like water falling from a great height <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we grounded and xavier seizing a great towrope leaped into the shallow water and passed the bight around a trunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cried out to nick but my voice was drowned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seized me and flung me under the cabins lee and then above the fearful note of the storm came cracklings like gunshots of great trees snapping at their trunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we saw the forest wall burst outhow far away i know not and the air was filled as with a flock of giant birds and boughs crashed on the roof of the cabin and tore the water in the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long we lay clutching each other in terror on the rocking boat i may not say but when the veil first lifted there was the river like an angry sea and limitless the wind in its fury whipping the foam from the crests and bearing it off into space <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and presently as we stared the note lowered and the wind was gone again and there was the water tossing foolishly and we lay safe amidst the green wreckage of the forest as by a miracle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was nick who moved first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with white face he climbed to the roof of the cabin and idly seizing the great limb that lay there tried to move it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> xavier who lay on his face on the bank rose to a sitting posture and crossed himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond me crowded the four members of the crew unhurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we heard xaviers voice in french thanking the blessed virgin for our escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> further speech was gone from us for men do not talk after such a matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we laid hold of the tree across the cabin and straining flung it over into the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great drop of rain hit me on the forehead and there came a silvergray downpour that blotted out the scene and drove us down below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then from somewhere in the depths of the dark cabin came a sound to make a mans blood run cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> benjy said he thank god he did not die of fright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we lighted a candle and poking around found the negro where he had crept into the farthest corner of a bunk with his face to the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when we touched him he gave vent to a yell that was bloodcurdling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ise a bad nigger lod yes i is he moaned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe most people still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and shouting charges and triumphs and flags and bandsin a time when half the world drew its food supply from regions ten thousand miles away the man with the white face paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i glanced at him and his face was intent on the floor of the carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little railway station a string of loaded trucks a signalbox and the back of a cottage shot by the carriage window and a bridge passed with a clap of noise echoing the tumult of the train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that he said i dreamt often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for three weeks of nights that dream was my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the worst of it was there were nights when i could not dream when i lay tossing on a bed in this accursed life and theresomewhere lost to methings were happeningmomentous terrible things  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lived at nightsmy days my waking days this life i am living now became a faded faraway dream a drab setting the cover of the book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could tell you all tell you every little thing in the dream but as to what i did in the daytimeno <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not telli do not remember <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the business of life slips from me he leant forward and pressed his hands upon his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a long time he said nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the war burst like a hurricane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stared before him at unspeakable things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one touch of unreality he said in the low tone of a man who speaks to himself and they would have been nightmares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they were not nightmaresthey were not nightmares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger of losing the rest of the story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he went on talking again in the same tone of questioning selfcommunion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was there to do but flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not thought the war would touch caprii had seemed to see capri as being out of it all as the contrast to it all but two nights after the whole place was shouting and bawling every woman almost and every other man wore a badgeeveshams badgeand there was no music but a jangling warsong over and over again and everywhere men enlisting and in the dancing halls they were drilling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole island was awhirl with rumours it was said again and again that fighting had begun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had seen so little of the life of pleasure that i had failed to reckon with this violence of the amateurs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as for me i was out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was like the man who might have prevented the firing of a magazine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was no one the vainest stripling with a badge counted for more than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowd jostled us and bawled in our ears that accursed song deafened us a woman shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her and we two went back to our own place again ruffled and insultedmy lady white and silent and i aquiver with rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so furious was i i could have quarrelled with her if i could have found one shade of accusation in her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all my magnificence had gone from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walked up and down our rock cell and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward that flared and passed and came again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must get out of this place i said over and over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have made my choice and i will have no hand in these troubles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will have nothing of this war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have taken our lives out of all and the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the rest was flightall the rest was flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much was there of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took no heed of my curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried to draw him back to his story with questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> southwest he said and glanced at me for a second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i should have thought an aeroplane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently i thought he was beginning but why should it be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if indeed this battle this slaughter and stress is life why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there is no refuge if there is no place of peace and if all our dreams of quiet places are a folly and a snare why have we such dreams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely it was no ignoble cravings no base intentions had brought us to this it was love had isolated us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> love had come to me with her eyes and robed in her beauty more glorious than all else in life in the very shape and colour of life and summoned me away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had silenced all the voices i had answered all the questionsi had come to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and suddenly there was nothing but war and death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all i said it could have been only a dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried flaming upon me a dreamwhen even now for the first time he became animated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a faint flush crept into his cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raised his open hand and clenched it and dropped it to his knee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke looking away from me and for all the rest of the time he looked away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said and the phantoms of phantoms desires like cloudshadows and wills of straw that eddy in the wind the days pass use and wont carry us through as a train carries the shadow of its lightsso be it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but one thing is real and certain one thing is no dream stuff but eternal and enduring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the centre of my life and all other things about it are subordinate or altogether vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i loved her that woman of a dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she and i are dead together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can it be a dream when it drenched a living life with unappeasable sorrow when it makes all that i have lived for and cared for worthless and unmeaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until that very moment when she was killed i believed we had still a chance of getting away he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all through the night and morning that we sailed across the sea from capri to salerno we talked of escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were full of hope and it clung about us to the end hope for the life together we should lead out of it all out of the battle and struggle the wild and empty passions the empty arbitrary thou shalt and thou shalt not of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were uplifted as though our quest was a holy thing as though love for another was a mission  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock caprialready scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and hidingplaces that were to make it a fastnesswe reckoned nothing of the imminent slaughter though the fury of preparation hung about in the puffs and clouds of dust at a hundred points amidst the gray but indeed i made a text of that and talked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there you know was the rock still beautiful for all its scars with its countless windows and arches and ways tier upon tier for a thousand feet a vast carving of gray broken by vineclad terraces and lemon and orange groves and masses of agave and prickly pear and puffs of almond blossom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and out under the archway that is built over the piccola marina other boats were coming and as we came round the cape and within sight of the mainland another little string of boats came into view driving before the wind towards the southwest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a little while a multitude had come out the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in the shadow of the eastward cliff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is love and reason i said fleeing from all this and though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the southern sky we did not heed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there it wasa line of little dots in the skyand then more dotting the southeastern horizon and then still more until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue specks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now they were all thin little strokes of blue and now one and now a multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came rising and falling and growing larger like some huge flight of gulls or rooks or suchlike birds moving with a marvellous uniformity and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a greater width of sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the southward wind flung itself in an arrowheaded cloud athwart the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and streamed eastward growing smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer again until they vanished from the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after that we noted to the northward and very high eveshams fighting machines hanging high over naples like an evening swarm of gnats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the mutter of guns far away in the southeast seemed to us to signify nothing  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each day each dream after that we were still exalted still seeking that refuge where we might live and love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fatigue had come upon us pain and many distresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for though we were dusty and stained by our toilsome tramping and half starved and with the horror of the dead men we had seen and the flight of the peasantsfor very soon a gust of fighting swept up the peninsulawith these things haunting our minds it still resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh but she was brave and patient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she who had never faced hardship and exposure had courage for herself and me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went to and fro seeking an outlet over a country all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first there were other fugitives but we did not mingle with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some escaped northward some were caught in the torrent of peasantry that swept along the main roads many gave themselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent northward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many of the men were impressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we kept away from these things we had brought no money to bribe a passage north and i feared for my lady at the hands of these conscript crowds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had landed at salerno and we had been turned back from cava and we had tried to cross towards taranto by a pass over mount alburno but we had been driven back for want of food and so we had come down among the marshes by paestum where those great temples stand alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had some vague idea that by paestum it might be possible to find a boat or something and take once more to sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there it was the battle overtook us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sort of soulblindness had me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plainly i could see that we were being hemmed in that the great net of that giant warfare had us in its toils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many times we had seen the levies that had come down from the north going to and fro and had come upon them in the distance amidst the mountains making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting of the guns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once we fancied they had fired at us taking us for spiesat any rate a shot had gone shuddering over us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several times we had hidden in woods from hovering aeroplanes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but all these things do not matter now these nights of flight and pain  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in an open place near those great temples at paestum at last on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes empty and desolate and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away showed to the feet of its stems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lady was sitting down under a bush resting a little for she was very weak and weary and i was standing up watching to see if i could tell the distance of the firing that came and went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were still you know fighting far from each other with those terrible new weapons that had never before been used guns that would carry beyond sight and aeroplanes that would dowhat they would do no man could foretell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that we were between the two armies and that they drew together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew we were in danger and that we could not stop there and rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though all these things were in my mind they were in the background <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed to be affairs beyond our concern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chiefly i was thinking of my lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time she had owned herself beaten and had fallen aweeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind me i could hear her sobbing but i would not turn round to her because i knew she had need of weeping and had held herself so far and so long for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was well i thought that she would weep and rest and then we would toil on again for i had no inkling of the thing that hung so near <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even now i can see her as she sat there her lovely hair upon her shoulder can mark again the deepening hollow of her cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even now i do not repent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not repent overhead in the sky flashed something and burst and all about us i heard the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly thrown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they chipped the stones about us and whirled fragments from the bricks and passed  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the flash i had turned about  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood up you know and moved a step towards meas and she had been shot through the heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped and stared at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt all that foolish incapacity an englishman feels on such occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i met his eyes for a moment and then stared out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a long space we kept silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when at last i looked at him he was sitting back in his corner his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he bit his nail suddenly and stared at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i carried her he said towards the temples in my armsas though it mattered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed a sort of sanctuary you know they had lasted so long i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must have died almost instantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> onlyi talked to her all the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen those temples i said abruptly and indeed he had brought those still sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the brown one the big brown one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat down on a fallen pillar and held her in my arms  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silent after the first babble was over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again as though nothing unusual was going on as though nothing had changed  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was tremendously still there the sun high and the shadows still even the shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were stillin spite of the thudding and banging that went all about the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south and that the battle went away to the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one aeroplane was struck and overset and fell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember thatthough it didnt interest me in the least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like a wounded gull you knowflapping for a time in the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see it down the aisle of the templea black thing in the bright blue water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three or four times shells burst about the beach and then that ceased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for a space <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was all the mischief done except that once a stray bullet gashed the stone hard bymade just a fresh bright surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the shadows grew longer the stillness seemed greater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the curious thing he remarked with the manner of a man who makes a trivial conversation is that i didnt thinkat all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat with her in my arms amidst the stonesin a sort of lethargystagnant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i dont remember waking up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont remember dressing that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know i found myself in my office with my letters all slit open in front of me and how i was struck by the absurdity of being there seeing that in reality i was sitting stunned in that paestum temple with a dead woman in my arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i read my letters like a machine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have forgotten what they were about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped and there was a long silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly i perceived that we were running down the incline from chalk farm to euston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i started at this passing of time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned on him with a brutal question with the tone of now or never <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to force himself to finish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more and as it were only for a few instants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seemed to have suddenly awakened out of a great apathy to have risen into a sitting position and the body lay there on the stones beside me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so soonit was not her  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only i knew clearly that men were coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood up and walked through the temple and then there came into sightfirst one man with a yellow face dressed in a uniform of dirty white trimmed with blue and then several climbing to the crest of the old wall of the vanished city and crouching there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were little bright figures in the sunlight and there they hung weapon in hand peering cautiously before them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and further away i saw others and then more at another point in the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a long lax line of men in open order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the man i had first seen stood up and shouted a command and his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he scrambled down with them and led them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came facing towards me and when he saw me he stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first i had watched these men with a mere curiosity but when i had seen they meant to come to the temple i was moved to forbid them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must not come here i cried i am here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am he stared and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i repeated what i had said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shouted again and i folded my arms and stood still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently he spoke to his men and came forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i signed to him to keep away but he continued to advance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him again very patiently and clearly you must not come presently he was so close i could see his face clearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a narrow face with dull gray eyes and a black moustache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a scar on his upper lip and he was dirty and unshaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kept shouting unintelligible things questions perhaps at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know now that he was afraid of me but at the time that did not occur to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i tried to explain to him he interrupted me in imperious tones bidding me i suppose stand aside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made to go past me and i caught hold of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw his face change at my grip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at me with cruel eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw a sort of exultant resolve leap into themdelight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly with a scowl he swept his sword backsoand thrust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brakes lifted their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this present world insisted upon itself became clamourous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw through the steamy window huge electric fights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog saw rows of stationary empty carriages passing by and then a signalbox hoisting its constellation of green and red into the murky london twilight marched after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked again at his drawn features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ran me through the heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with a sort of astonishmentno fear no painbut just amazement that i felt it pierce me felt the sword drive home into my body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the yellow platform lights came into the field of view passing first rapidly then slowly and at last stopping with a jerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dim shapes of men passed to and fro without <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no pain no sting or smart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amazement and then darkness sweeping over everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hot brutal face before me the face of the man who had killed me seemed to recede <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it swept out of existence euston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the carriage door opened admitting a flood of sound and a porter stood regarding us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sounds of doors slamming and the hoofclatter of cabhorses and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the london cobblestones came to my ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a truckload of lighted lamps blazed along the platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a darkness a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out all things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then almost inaudibly he answered no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was there on the other side of the temple and then yes i insisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great birds that fought and tore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was hot and overcast the sky red rimmed with the lingering sunset of midsummer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sat at the open window trying to fancy the air was fresher there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and dark beyond in the roadway a gas lamp burnt bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farther were the three lights of the railway signal against the lowering sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man and woman spoke to one another in low tones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the man a little nervously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not he she said peevishly as though that too irritated her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has no imagination no poetry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of these men of iron have he said sententiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned her discontented face towards the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew in volume the house quivered one heard the metallic rattle of the tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the train passed there was a glare of light above the cutting and a driving tumult of smoke one two three four five six seven eight black oblongseight truckspassed across the dim grey of the embankment and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the tunnel which with the last seemed to swallow down train smoke and sound in one abrupt gulp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this country was all fresh and beautiful once he said and nowit is gehenna <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down that waynothing but potbanks and chimneys belching fire and dust into the face of heaven  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an end comes an end to all this cruelty  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke the last word in a whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow she said speaking in a whisper too and still staring out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said putting his hand on hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned with a start and their eyes searched one anothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said and then it seems so strange that you should have come into my life like thisto open she paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this wonderful world she hesitated and spoke still more softlythis world of love to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly the door clicked and closed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they turned their heads and he started violently back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy figuresilent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they saw the face dimly in the halflight with unexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every muscle in rauts body suddenly became tense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when could the door have opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the newcomers voice came at last after a pause that seemed interminable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was afraid i had missed you horrocks said the man at the window gripping the windowledge with his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clumsy figure of horrocks came forward out of the shadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made no answer to rauts remark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he stood above them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the womans heart was cold within her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut it was just possible you might come back she said in a voice that never quivered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks still silent sat down abruptly in the chair by her little worktable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his big hands were clenched one saw now the fire of his eyes under the shadow of his brows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was trying to get his breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted and then back to the woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time and for the moment all three half understood one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet none dared say a word to ease the pentup things that choked them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the husbands voice that broke the silence at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came to see you he said resolved to lie to the last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you promised said raut to show me some fine effects of moonlight and smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke repeated horrocks in a colourless voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i thought i might catch you tonight before you went down to the works proceeded raut and come with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did the man mean to take the thing coolly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long had he been in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet even at the moment when they heard the door their attitudes  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks glanced at the profile of the woman shadowy pallid in the halflight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he glanced at raut and seemed to recover himself suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course he said i promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic conditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its odd how i could have forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i am troubling you began raut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a new light had suddenly come into the sultry gloom of his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not in the least he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow you think so splendid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the woman turning now to her husband for the first time her confidence creeping back again her voice just one halfnote too high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that dreadful theory of yours that machinery is beautiful and everything else in the world ugly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought he would not spare you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its his great theory his one discovery in art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am slow to make discoveries said horrocks grimly damping her suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing and suddenly he rose to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i promised to show you the works he said to raut and put his big clumsy hand on his friends shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you are ready to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite said raut and stood up also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each of them peered through the indistinctness of the dusk at the other two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks hand still rested on rauts shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut half fancied still that the incident was trivial after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks knew her husband better knew that grim quiet in his voice and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well said horrocks and dropping his hand turned towards the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut looked round in the halflight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks with a gust of hysterical laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their hands came together on the back of the chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had an impulse to warn him in an undertone but she could not frame a word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> struggled in her mind and the swift moment passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said horrocks standing with the door half open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks said the ironmaster even more grimly quiet in his tone than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks he said and their hands touched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him towards men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut went out and then after a wordless look at her her husband followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood motionless while rauts light footfall and her husbands heavy tread like bass and treble passed down the passage together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went to the window moving slowly and stood watchingleaning forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two men appeared for a moment at the gateway in the road passed under the street lamp and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lamplight fell for a moment on their faces showing only unmeaning pale patches telling nothing of what she still feared and doubted and craved vainly to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big armchair her eyes wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an hour after she was still there her attitude scarcely changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon raut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went side by side down the road in silence and in silence turned into the cindermade byway that presently opened out the prospect of the valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a blue haze half dust half mist touched the long valley with mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond were hanley and etruria grey and dark masses outlined thinly by the rare golden dots of the street lamps and here and there a gaslit window or the yellow glare of some lateworking factory or crowded publichouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of the masses clear and slender against the evening sky rose a multitude of tall chimneys many of them reeking a few smokeless during a season of play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there a pallid patch and ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a potbank or a wheel black and sharp against the hot lower sky marked some colliery where they raise the iridescent coal of the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nearer at hand was the broad stretch of railway and half invisible trains shunteda steady puffing and rumbling with every run a ringing concussion and a rhythmic series of impacts and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam across the further view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to the left between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond dominating the whole view colossal inkyblack and crowned with smoke and fitful flames stood the great cylinders of the jeddah company blast furnaces the central edifices of the big ironworks of which horrocks was the manager <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stood heavy and threatening full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten iron and about the feet of them rattled the rollingmills and the steam hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even as they looked a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the giants and the red flames gleamed out and a confusion of smoke and black dust came boiling upwards towards the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly you get some fine effects of colour with your furnaces said raut breaking a silence that had become apprehensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood with his hands in his pockets frowning down at the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond frowning as if he were thinking out some knotty problem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut glanced at him and away again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at present your moonlight effect is hardly ripe he continued looking upward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon is still smothered by the vestiges of daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly awakened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he too looked up at the moon pale still in the midsummer sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come along he said suddenly and gripping rauts arm in his hand made a move towards the path that dropped from them to the railway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that their eyes came near to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks hand tightened and then relaxed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he let go and before raut was aware of it they were arm in arm and walking one unwillingly enough down the path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see the fine effect of the railway signals towards burslem said horrocks suddenly breaking into loquacity striding fast and tightening the grip of his elbow the while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little green lights and red and white lights all against the haze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have an eye for effect raut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and look at those furnaces of mine how they rise upon us as we come down the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that to the right is my petseventy feet of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i packed him myself and hes boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts for five long years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive a particular fancy for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that line of red therea lovely bit of warm orange youd call it rautthats the puddlers furnaces and there in the hot light three black figuresdid you see the white splash of the steamhammer then?thats the rolling mills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clang clatter how it goes rattling across the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glass mirrors are not in it when that stuff comes from the mill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and squelch!there goes the hammer again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had to stop talking to catch at his breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his arm twisted into rauts with benumbing tightness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had come striding down the black path towards the railway as though he was possessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut had not spoken a word had simply hung back against horrocks pull with all his strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say he said now laughing nervously but with an undernote of snarl in his voice why on earth are you nipping my arm off horrocks and dragging me along like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its you taught me the trick of walking in that friendly way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent learnt the refinements of it yet then said raut laughing artificially again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stood now near the bottom of the hill close to the fence that bordered the railway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ironworks had grown larger and spread out with their approach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of down the further view of etruria and hanley had dropped out of sight with their descent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before them by the stile rose a noticeboard bearing still dimly visible the words beware of the trains half hidden by splashes of coaly mud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fine effects said horrocks waving his arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the puffs of smoke the orange glare the round eye of light in front of it the melodious rattle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but these furnaces of mine used to be finer before we shoved cones in their throats and saved the gas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the flames used to flare out of the open throats greatwhat is it?pillars of cloud by day red and black smoke and pillars of fire by night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now we run it off in pipes and burn it to heat the blast and the top is shut by a cone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll be interested in that cone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but every now and then said raut you get a burst of fire and smoke up there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cones not fixed its hung by a chain from a lever and balanced by an equipoise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> else of course thered be no way of getting fuel into the thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every now and then the cone dips and out comes the flare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon gets brighter he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come along said horrocks abruptly gripping his shoulder again and moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then came one of those swift incidents vivid but so rapid that they leave one doubtful and reeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> halfway across horrocks hand suddenly clenched upon him like a vice and swung him backward and through a halfturn so that he looked up the line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there a chain of lamplit carriagewindows telescoped swiftly as it came towards them and the red and yellow lights of an engine grew larger and larger rushing down upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he grasped what this meant he turned his face to horrocks and pushed with all his strength against the arm that held him back between the rails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the struggle did not last a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as certain as it was that horrocks held him there so certain was it that he had been violently lugged out of danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of the way said horrocks with a gasp as the train came rattling by and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not see it coming said raut still even in spite of his own apprehensions trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cone he said and then as one who recovers himself i thought you did not hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt have had you run over then for the world said horrocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment i lost my nerve said raut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks stood for half a minute then turned abruptly towards the ironworks again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see how fine these great mounds of mine these clinkerheaps look in the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that truck yonder up above there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up it goes and outtilts the slag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see the palpitating red stuff go sliding down the slope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we get nearer the heap rises up and cuts the blast furnaces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see the quiver up above the big one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that goes to the puddling furnaces but i want to show you the canal first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came and took raut by the elbow and so they went along side by side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he asked himself had really happened on the line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was he deluding himself with his own fancies or had horrocks actually held him back in the way of the train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he just been within an ace of being murdered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose this slouching scowling monster did know anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a minute or two then raut was really afraid for his life but the mood passed as he reasoned with himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all horrocks might have heard nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate he had pulled him out of the way in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his odd manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was talking now of the ashheaps and the canal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our canal said horrocks stopping suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our canal by moonlight and firelight is an immense effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve spent too many of your evenings philandering up in newcastle there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you for real florid effectsbut you shall see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came out of the labyrinth of clinkerheaps and mounds of coal and ore the noises of the rollingmill sprang upon them suddenly loud near and distinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to horrocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their faces were vague in the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut felt a futile impulse to address them and before he could frame his words they passed into the shadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now a weirdlooking place it seemed in the bloodred reflections of the furnaces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hot water that cooled the tuyeres came into it some fifty yards up a tumultuous almost boiling affluent and the steam rose up from the water in silent white wisps and streaks wrapping damply about them an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red eddies a white uprising that made the head swim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shining black tower of the larger blastfurnace rose overhead out of the mist and its tumultuous riot filled their ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut kept away from the edge of the water and watched horrocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here it is red said horrocks bloodred vapour as red and hot as sin but yonder there where the moonlight falls on it and it drives across the clinkerheaps it is as white as death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut turned his head for a moment and then came back hastily to his watch on horrocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come along to the rollingmills said horrocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the threatening hold was not so evident that time and raut felt a little reassured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but all the same what on earth did horrocks mean about white as death and red as sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while and then through the rollingmills where amidst an incessant din the deliberate steamhammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron and black halfnaked titans rushed the plastic bars like hot sealingwax between the wheels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on said horrocks in rauts ear and they went and peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyeres and saw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blastfurnace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it left one eye blinded for a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with green and blue patches dancing across the dark they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime were raised to the top of the big cylinder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace rauts doubts came upon him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it wise to be here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do what he would he could not resist a violent trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reek of the furnace a sulphurous vapor streaked with pungent bitterness seemed to make the distant hillside of hanley quiver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon was riding out now from among a drift of clouds halfway up the sky above the undulating wooded outlines of newcastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the steaming canal ran away from below them under an indistinct bridge and vanished into the dim haze of the flat fields towards burslem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the cone ive been telling you of shouted horrocks and below that sixty feet of fire and molten metal with the air of the blast frothing through it like gas in sodawater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raut gripped the handrail tightly and stared down at the cone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a thunderous accompaniment to horrocks voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the thing had to be gone through now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the middle bawled horrocks temperature near a thousand degrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you were dropped into it  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flash into flame like a pinch of gunpowder in a candle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why even up here ive seen the rainwater boiling off the trucks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the top side of its three hundred degrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will boil the blood out of you in no time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boil the blood out of you in  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with one hand he clutched at the handrail then with both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment the two men stood swaying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly with a violent jerk horrocks had twisted him from his hold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clutched at horrocks and missed his foot went back into empty air in midair he twisted himself and then cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clutched the chain by which the cone hung and the thing sank an infinitesimal amount as he struck it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a circle of glowing red appeared about him and a tongue of flame released from the chaos within flickered up towards him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an intense pain assailed him at the knees and he could smell the singeing of his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raised himself to his feet and tried to climb up the chain and then something struck his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> black and shining with the moonlight the throat of the furnace rose about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horrocks he saw stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the rail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight and shouting fizzle you fool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck and flung it deliberately lump after lump at raut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clung crying to the chain pulling himself up from the burning of the cone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each missile horrocks flung hit him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his clothes charred and glowed and as he struggled the cone dropped and a rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his human likeness departed from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the momentary red had passed horrocks saw a charred blackened figure its head streaked with blood still clutching and fumbling with the chain and writhing in agonya cindery animal an inhuman monstrous creature that began a sobbing intermittent shriek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> abruptly at the sight the ironmasters anger passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a deadly sickness came upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his nostrils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew the thing below him save that it still moved and felt was already a dead manthat the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in his veins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an intense realisation of that agony came to his mind and overcame every other feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he stood irresolute and then turning to the truck he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling thing that had once been a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mass fell with a thud and went radiating over the cone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the thud the shriek ended and a boiling confusion of smoke dust and flame came rushing up towards him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it passed he saw the cone clear again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he staggered back and stood trembling clinging to the rail with both hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his lips moved but no words came to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down below was the sound of voices and running steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clangour of rolling in the shed ceased abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she inquired her grave eyes upon him with an irresistible appeal for truth in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow didnt lie to you evaded he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know it but tetlow is going to ask you to marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i knew replied she indifferently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as i knew you were not going to ask me to marry you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mere phrase even when stated as a negation gave him a sensation of ice suddenly laid against the heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its quite easy to tell the difference between the two kinds of menthose that care for me more than they care for themselves and those that care for themselves more than they care for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way it looks to youis it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way it is said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some things you dont understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ive my own ideaand im going to stick to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are a very opinionated and selfconfident young lady said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im taking up a lot of your time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent asked when the new deal is to begin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yesand i shall have to tell mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow im not taking the place he got for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be careful what you say to him cautioned norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must see it wouldnt be well to tell him what you are going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres no reason on earth why he should know your businessis there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not reply she was reflecting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not thinking of marrying tetloware you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont love himand couldnt learn to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a sincerely judicial air now that he felt secure he said why not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be a good match <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont love him she repeated as if that were a sufficient and complete answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he was astonished to find that he so regarded it also in spite of every assault of all that his training had taught him to regard as common sense about human nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can simply say to tetlow that youve decided to stay at home and take care of your father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the offices of the company will be at your house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your official duties practically amount to taking care of your father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so youll be speaking the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh it isnt exactly lying to keep something from somebody who has no right to know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what you suggest isnt quite the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its near enough and ill say it to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his own view of lying was the same as that she had expressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he had no squeamishness about saying what was in no sense true if the falsehood were necessary to his purposes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet her statement of her code moral though he thought it and eminently sensible as well lowered her once more in his estimation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was eager to find reason or plausible excuse for believing her morally other and less than she seemed to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately the prospects of his ultimate projects whatever they might prove to betook on a more hopeful air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and id advise you to have tetlow keep away from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont want him nosing round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a nice man but tiresome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i encouraged him ever so little hed be sentimental <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most tiresome thing in the world to a girl is a man who talks that sort of thing when she doesnt want to hear itfrom him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont worry about that mocked he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shant till i have to she assured him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i dont think ill have to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the monday morning following tetlow came in to see norman as soon as he arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want a two weeks leave he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to bermuda or down there somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do look ill old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw her last night replied the chief clerk dropping an effort at concealing his dejection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> normans tone of sympathetic surprise would not have deceived half attentive ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why billy she cant hope to make as good a match <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what i told herwhen i saw the game was going against me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman trifled nervously with the papers before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently he said is it some one else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because she said so replied the head clerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ohif she said so that settles it said norman with raillery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes given up workthank god pursued tetlow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes getting more beautiful all the time norman if you had seen her last night youd understand why im stark mad about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hands the muscles of his jaw were clinched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i mustnt think of that tetlow went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i was about to say if she were to stay on in the offices some onesome attractive man like you only with the heart of a scoundrel norman laughed cynically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some scoundrel would tempt her beyond her power to resist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> money and clothes and luxury will do anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all get to be harlots here in new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of us know it and some dont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we all look it and act it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and shed go the way of the restwith or without marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its just as well she didnt marry me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know whatd have become of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow shes safe at home with her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes found a backer for his experiments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can spare me for ten days tetlow went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id be of no use if i stayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a depth of misery in his kind gray eyes that moved norman to get up and lay a friendly hand on his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the best thing old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow dropped into a chair and sobbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has killed me he groaned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mean ill commit suicide or die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh come billywheres your good sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what im talking about said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman god help the man who meets the woman he really wantsgod help him if she doesnt want him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any woman you wanted would be sure to want you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman his hand still on tetlows shoulder was staring ahead with a terrible expression upon his strong features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she could see the inside of methe part thats the real mei think she would love meor learn to love me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she can only see the outsidethis homely face and body of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its horrible fredto have a mind and a heart fit for love and for being loved and an outside that repels it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how many of us poor devils of that sort there aremen and women both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman was at the window now his back to the room to his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a while tetlow rose and made a feeble effort to straighten himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it all right about the vacation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill see you before you go said norman still facing the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when norman turned he was alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in no way was normans luck superior to most mens more splendidly than in that his inborn tendency to arrogant and extravagant desires was matched by an inborn capacity to get the necessary money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his luxurious tastes were certainly not moderated by his associationsenormously rich people who while they could be stingy enough in some respects at the same time could and did fling away fortunes in gratifying selfish whimsfor silly showy houses for retinues of wasteful servants for gewgaws that accentuated the homeliness of their homely women and coarsened and vulgarized their pretty womenor perhaps for a nights gambling or entertaining or for the forced smiles and contemptuous caresses of some belle of the other world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman fortunately cared not at all for the hugely expensive pomp of the life of the rich if he had he would have hopelessly involved himself as after all he was not a moneygrubber but a lawyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when there appeared anything for which he did care he was ready to bid for it like the richest of the rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore the investment of a few thousand dollars seemed a small matter to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had many a time tossed away far more for far less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not dole out the sum he had agreed to provide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paid it into the jersey city bank to the credit of the chemical research company and informed its secretary and treasurer that she could draw freely against it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will read the bylaws of the company said he you will see that youve the right to spend exactly as you see fit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the money runs low let me know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be very careful said dorothea hallowell secretary and treasurer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats precisely what we dont want replied he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he glanced round the tiny parlor of the cottage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we want everything to be run in firstclass shape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the only way to get results <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first of all you must take a proper housea goodsized one with large groundsroom for building your father a proper laboratory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her dazed and dazzled expression delighted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must keep at least two servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father has five thousand a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rent of the house and the wages and keep of the servants are a charge against the corporation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you can well afford to make yourselves comfortable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent got used to the idea as yet said dorothea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yeswe are better off than we were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to get some clothesand things of that sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shrank within herself and sat quiet her gaze fixed upon her hands lying limp in her lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no reason why your father shouldnt be made absolutely comfortable and happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way to get the best results from a man of his sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she faded on toward the selfeffacing blank he had first known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think it out dorothy he said in his frankest kindliest way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive an instinct against it replied she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id rather father and i kept on as we are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve no right to live in this small cramping way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must broaden out and give him room to grow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she gazed round helplesslyim afraid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill have to be verycareful she said thoughtfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only dont live and think on a tendollaraweek basis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that isnt the way to get on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never again brought up the matter in direct form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but most of his conversation was indirect and more or less subtle suggestions as to ways of branching out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she moved cautiously for a few days then timidly began to spend money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a notion widely spread abroad that people who have little money know more about the art of spending money and the science of economizing than those who have much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be about as sensible to say that the best swimmers are those who have never been near the water or no nearer than a bath tub <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyone wishing to be convinced need only make an excursion into the poor tenement district and observe the garbage barrels overflowing with spoiled foodor the trashy goods exposed for sale in the shops and the markets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who have had money and have lost it are probably as a rule the wisest in thrift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who have never had money are almost invariably prodigal because they are ignorant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when dorothea hallowell was a baby the family had had money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but never since she could remember had they been anything but poor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not know how to spend money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not know prices or valuesbeing in that respect precisely like the mass of mankindand womankindwho imagine they are economical because they hunt socalled bargains and haggle with merchants who have got doubly ready for them by laying in inferior goods and by putting up prices in advance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew how much ten dollars a week was the meaning of the twenty to thirty dollars a week her father had made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she had only a faintand exaggeratedly mistakennotion about sixtyfive hundred a yearsix and a half thousands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed wealth to her so vast that a hundred thousand a year would have seemed no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as she drifted away from the known coursethe thirty to forty dollars a week upon which they had been living dorothea hallowell was in a trackless sea with a broken compass and no chart whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a common enough experience in america the land of sudden changes of fortune of rosiest hopes about striking it rich of carelessness and ignorance as to values of eager and untrained appetite for luxury and novelty of any and every kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first any expenditure however small for the plainest comfort which had been beyond their means seemed a giddy extravagance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a bank accountand a check booksoon dissipated that nervousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few charge accounts a little practice in the simple easy gesture of drawing a check and she was almost at her ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with people who have known only squalor or with those who have earned their better fortune by privation and slow accumulation the spreading out process is usually slownot so slow as it used to be when our merchants had not learned the art of tempting any and every kind of human nature but still far from rapid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a piece of money reminds them vividly and painfully of the toil put into acquiring it and they shy away from the pitfall of the facile check <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with those born and bred as dorothy was and elevated into what seems to them affluence by no effort of their own the spreading is a tropical overnight affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> counting all she spent and arranged to spend in those first few weeks you had no great total <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was great for a girl who had been making ten dollars a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also there were sown in her mind broadcast and thick the seeds of desire for more luxurious comfort of need for it that could never be uprooted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman came over almost every evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got a new and youthful and youthrestoring kind of pleasure out of this process of expansion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he liked to hear each trifling detail and he was always making suggestions that bore immediate fruit in further expenditure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he again brought up the subject of a larger house she listened with only the faintest protests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her ideas of such a short time before seemed small laughably small now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father was worrying only this morning because he is so cramped she admitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must remedy that at once said norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and on the following sunday he and she went house hunting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they found a satisfactory placepeculiarly satisfactory to norman because it was near the hudson tunnel and so only a few minutes from his office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to dorothy it loomed a mansion almost a palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact it was a modestly roomy oldfashioned brick house with a brick stable at the side that with a little changing would make an admirable laboratory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent the timeor the experienceto fit this place up said norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill attend to itthat is ill have it attended to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing her uneasy expression he added i can get much better terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres no sense in wasting moneyis there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave the order to a firm of decorators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a moderate order considering the amount of work that had to be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if the girl had seen the estimates norman indorsed she would have been terrified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however he saw to it that she did not see them and she ignorant of values believed him when he told her the general account of the corporation must be charged with two thousand dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her alarm took him by surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sum seemed small to himand it was only about one fifth what the alterations and improvements had cost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried she why thats more than our whole income for a year has been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are forgetting these improvements add to the value of the property <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are sure you didnt pay those decorators and furnishers too much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yesyes indeed she assured him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buttwo thousand dollars is a lot of money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman regretted that as his whole object had been to please her he had not ordered the more showy cheaper stuff but had insisted upon the simplest plainest looking appointments throughout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even her bedroom furniture even her dressing table set was of the kind that suggests cost only to the experienced carefully and well educated in values and in taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im sure it isnt fair to charge all these things to the company she protested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the things for my personal use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are a fierce watchdog of a treasurer said norman laughing at her but noting and respecting the fine instinct of good breeding shown in her absence of greediness of desire to get all she could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im letting the firm of decorators take over what you leave behind in the old house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill see what theyll allow for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe that will cover the expense you object to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor was she in the least suspicious when he announced that the decorators had made such a liberal allowance that the deficit was but three hundred dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those chaps he explained have a wide margin of profit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides theyre eager to get more and bigger work from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few weeks and he was enjoying the sight of her ensconced with her father in luxurious comfortwith two servants with a wellrun house with pleasant gardens with all that is at the command of an income of six thousand a year in a comparatively inexpensive city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only occasionallyand then not deeplywas he troubled by the reflection that he was still far from his goal and had made apparently absurdly little progress toward it through all this maneuvering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth was he preferred to linger when lingering gave him so many new kinds of pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of those in the large and motley company that sit down to the banquet of the senses the most are crude if not coarse gluttons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they eat fast and furiously having a raw appetite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then there is one who has some idea of the art of enjoymentthe art of prolonging and varying both the joys of anticipation and the joys of realization <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned his attention to tempting her to extravagance in dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rut his success there was not all he could have wished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she no longer looked the poor working girl struggling desperately to be neat and clean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had almost immediately taken on the air of the comfortable classes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rut everything she got for herself was inexpensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she made dresses for herself and trimmed all her hats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the hats norman found no fault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there her good taste produced about as satisfactory results as could have been got at the fashionable millinersmore satisfactory than are got by the women who go there with no taste of their own beyond a hazy idea that they want something like what mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but homemade dresses were a different matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman longed to have her in toilettes that would bring out the full beauty of her marvelous figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he after the manner of the more intelligent and worldly wise new york men had some knowledge of womens clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his sister knew how to dress josephine knew how though her taste was somewhat too sober to suit normanat least to suit him in dorothy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought out and suggested dresses to dorothy and told her where to get them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorothy tried to carry out at home such of his suggestions as pleased herfor like all women she believed she knew how to dress herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have contented a less exacting and less trained taste than normans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have contented him had he not been infatuated with her beauty of face and form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was the improvement in her appearance only served to intensify his agitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he now saw in her not only all that had first conquered him but also those unsuspected beauties and gracesand possibilities of beauty and grace yet more entrancing were she but dressed properly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont begin to appreciate how beautiful you are said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had ever been one of his rules in dealing with women to feed their physical vanity sparingly and cautiously lest it should blaze up into one of those consuming flames that produce a very frenzy of conceit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this rule like all the others had gone by the board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not conceal his infatuation from her not even when he saw that it was turning her head and making his task harder and harder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you would only go over to new york to several dressmakers whose names ill give you i know youd get clothes from them that you could touch up into something uncommon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant afford it said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i have is good enoughand costs more than ive the right to pay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and her tone silenced him it was the tone of finality and he had discovered that she had a will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never before had frederick norman let any important thing drift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he started in with dorothy he had no idea of changing that fixed policy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have scoffed if anyone had foretold to him that he would permit the days and the weeks to go by with nothing definite accomplished toward any definite purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every time he came he had in mind a fixed resolve to make distinct progress with the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every time he left he had a furious quarrel with himself for his weakness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is making a fool of me he said to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must be laughing at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he returned only to repeat his folly to add one more to the lengthening mocking series of lost opportunities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth lay deeper than he saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he recognized only his own weakness of the infatuated lovers fatuous timidity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not realize how potent her charm for him was how completely content she made him when he was with her just from the fact that they were together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a time an unsatisfied passion often thus diffuses itself ceases to be a narrow torrent becomes a broad river whose resistless force is hidden beneath an appearance of sparkling calm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her ingenuousness amused him her developing taste and imagination interested him her freshness her freedom from any sense of his importance in the world fascinated him and there was a keener pleasure than he dreamed in the novel sensation of breathing the perfume of what he the one time cynic would have staked his life on being unsullied purity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their relations were to him a delightful variation upon the intimacy of master and pupil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either he was listening to her or was answering her questions and the time flew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there never was a moment when he could have introduced the subject that most concerned him when he was not with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to have introduced it would have been rudely to break the charm of a happy afternoon or evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was she leading him on and on nowhere deliberately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or was it the sweet and innocent simplicity it seemed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have broken the charm and put the matter to the test had he not been afraid of the consequences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was she not in his power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was she not his whenever he should stretch forth his hand and claim her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesno doubt not the slightest doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was afraid to break the charm it was such a satisfying charm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men who arrive anywhere in any direction always have the habit of ignoring the nonessential more or less strongly developed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one reasonperhaps the chief reasonwhy norman had got up to the high places of material success at so early an age was that he had an unerring instinct for the essential and wasted no time or energy upon the nonessential <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his present situation dorothys father the abstracted man of science was one of the factors that obviously fell into the nonessential class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman knew little about him and cared less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he took care to avoid knowing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knowing the father would open up possibilities of discomfort but being a wise young man norman gave this matter the least possible thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still it was necessary that the two men see something of each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hallowell discovered nothing about norman not enough about his personal appearance to have recognized him in the street far enough away from the laboratory to dissociate the two ideas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> human beingsexcept his daughterdid not interest hallowell and his feeling for her was somewhat in the nature of an abstraction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman on the other hand was intensely interested in human beings indeed he was interested in little else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was always thrusting through surfaces probing into minds and souls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sought thoroughly to understand the living machines he used in furthering his ambitions and desires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it was not long before he learned much about old newton hallowelland began to admire himand with a man of normans temperament to admire is to like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had assumed at the outset that the scientist was more or less the crank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not talked with him many times before he discovered that far from being in any respect a crank he was a most able and well balanced mentalitya genius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day came when dorothy not having returned from a shopping tour he lingered in the laboratory talking with the father or rather listening while the man of great ideas unfolded to him conceptions of the world that set his imagination to soaring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of us see but dimly beyond the ends of our noses and visualize what lies within our range of sight most imperfectly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know little about ourselves less about others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we fancy that the world and the human race always have been about as they now are and always will be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> history reads to us like a fairy tale to which we give conventional acceptance as truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to the future we can conceive nothing but the continuation of just what we see about us in the present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman practical man though he was living in and for the present had yet an imagination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought hallowell a kind of fool for thinking only of the future and working only for itbut he soon came to think him n divine fool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and through hallowells spectacles he was charmed for many an hour with visions of the world that is to be when in the slow but steady processes of evolution the human race will become intelligent will conquer the universe with the weapons of science and will make it over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he first stated his projects to norman the young man had difficulty in restraining his amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a new idea in any line of thought with which we are not familiar always strikes us as ridiculous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman had been educated in the ignorant conventional way still in high repute among the vulgar and among those whose chief delight is to make the vulgar gape in awe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he therefore had no science that is no knowledgeoutside his professionbut only what is called learning though tommyrot would be a fitter name for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had only the most meager acquaintance with that great fundamental of a sound and sane education embryology <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew nothing of what science had already done to destroy all the still current notions about the mystery of life and birth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still laughed as at a clever bit of legerdemain when hallowell showed him how far science had progressed toward mastery of the life of the lower forms of existencehow those worms could be artificially created could be aged made young again made diseased and decrepit restored to perfect health could be swung back and forth or sideways or sinuously along the span of existencecould even be killed and brought back to vigor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve been at this sort of thing only a few years said hallowell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rather think it will not be many years now before we shall not even need the initial germ of life to enable us to create but can do it by pure chemical means just as a taper is lighted by holding a match to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman ceased to think of sleightofhand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> life continued the juggler transformed now into practical man leader of men life has been demonstrated to be simply one of the forms of energy or one of the consequences of energy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the final discovery is scientifically not far away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a body that is renewable much as any of our inanimate machines of the factory is renewable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far as we know no living thing ever dies except by violence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> diseaseold agethey are quite as much violence as the knife and the bullet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what science can now do with these worms as my daughter calls themthat it will be able to do with the higher organisms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the world would soon be jammed to the last acre objected norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there will be no necessity to create new people except to take the place of those who may be accidentally obliterated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the world is dyingthe earth itself i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but science may learn how to arrest that cooling processor to adapt man to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or it may be that when the world ceases to be inhabitable we shall have learned how to cross the star spaces as i think ive suggested before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thenwe should simply find a planet in its youth somewhere and migrate to it as a man now moves to a new house when the old ceases to please him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a long flight of the fancy said norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> longbut no stronger than the telegraph or the telephone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trouble with us is that we have been long stupefied by the ignorant theological ideas of the universeideas that have come down to us from the childhood of the race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we havent got used to the new erathe scientific era <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why until less than three generations ago there was really no such thing as science <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hadnt thought of that admitted norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we certainly have got on very fast in those three generations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not so fast however as we shall in the next three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sciencechemistryis going speedily to change all the conditions of life because it will turn topsyturvy all the ways of producing thingsfood clothing shelter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> less than two generations ago men lived much as they had for thousands of years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be inconceivably different tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman could not get these ideas out of his brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to understand why hallowell cared nothing about the active life of the dayabout its religion politics modes of labor its habits of one creature preying upon another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow not religion not politics but chemistry not priests nor politicians but chemists would change all thatand change it by the only methods that compel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an abstract idea of liberty or justice can be rejected evaded nullified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a telephone a steam engine a mode of prolonging lifethose realizations of ideas compel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when dorothy came norman went into the garden with her in a frame of mind so different from any he had ever before experienced that he scarcely recognized himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the influence of the fathers glowing imagination of genius waned before the daughters physical loveliness and enchantment for him he said to himself ill keep away from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not permit himself to go on to examine into his reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he could not conceal them from himself quickly enough to hide the knowledge that they were moral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the matter with you today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not a bit interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interested you mean he said with a smile of raillery for he had long since discovered that she was not without the feminine vanity that commands the centering of all interest in the woman herself and resents any wandering of thought as a slur upon her own powers of fascination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are thinking about something else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner had he got away from the house than the scientific dreaming vanished and he wished himself back with her againback where every glance at her gave him the most exquisite sensations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he came the following day he apparently had once more restored her father to his proper place of a nonessential <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that definitely remained of the day befores impression was a certain satisfaction that he was aiding with his money an enterprise of greater value and of less questionable character than merely his own project <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the powerful influences upon our life and conduct are rarely direct and definite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he quite unconsciously had a wholly different feeling about dorothy because of her father because of what his new knowledge of and respect for her father had revealed and would continue to reveal to him as to the girl herselfher training her inheritance her character that could not but be touched with the splendor of the fathers noble genius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and long afterward when the father as a distinct personality had been almost forgotten nor man was still altogether unconsciously influenced by himpowerfully perhaps decisively influenced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman had no notion of it but ever after that talk in the laboratory dorothy hallowell was to him newton hallowells daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he came the following day with his original purposes and plans once more intact as he thought he found that she had made more of a toilet than usual had devised a new way of doing her hair that enabled him to hang a highly prized addition in his memory gallery of widely varied portraits of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sat under a big old tree at the end of the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw that she was much disturbedand that it had to do with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from time to time she looked at him studying his face when she thought herself unobserved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he had learned that it is never wise to open up the disagreeable he waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after making several futile efforts at conversation she i saw mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was coming out of a chemical supplies store where father had sent me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but norman did not help her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlowacted very strangely she went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stared at me as if he werent going to speakas if i werent fit to speak to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he came hurrying after me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he said do you know that norman is to be married in two weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i said what of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was surprised that you hadnt spoken of it replied she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was more interested in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think he said next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whythat i was even more shameless than he thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said oh i know all about you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shant tell anyone for i cant help loving you still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it has killed my belief in woman to find out that you would sell yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was looking at norman with eyes large and grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked at him as if he werent there and started on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he said when norman abandons you as he soon will you can count on me if you need a friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then norman said and that was all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive not seen him since he went away to bermudaat least he said he was going there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day he sent the firm a formal letter of resignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you regret not having married him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt marry a man i didnt love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with sweet friendly eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt even marry you much as i like you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman laugheda dismal attempt at ease and raillery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he told me about your marrying she went on i knew how i felt about you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i was not a bit jealous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why havent you ever said anything about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaned forward and with curious deliberateness took her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she let it lie gently in his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put his arm round her and drew her close to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kissed her upturned face kissed her upon the lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she remained passive looking at him with calm eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she kissed himwithout hesitation and without warmth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do you look at me so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why you should wish to kiss me when you love another woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would she say if she knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i rather think i dont care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are the only person on earth that interests me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clasped her passionately kissed her at first with selfrestraint then in a kind of frenzy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can you be so cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not love you she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive sometimes thought perhaps it was because you dont love me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you want me to say or do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you asked me why i didnt love you and i was trying to explain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want anything more than im getting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as well ask tantalus if he is content with the water always before his eyes and always out of reach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you all you have to give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt be content with less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ought not to talk to me this way she reproved gently when you are engaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flung her hand into her lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are making a fool of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely never since man was created has there been such another ass as i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew her to her feet seized her roughly by the shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when are you coming to your senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she inquired in her child like puzzled way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook her kissed her violently held her at arms length <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think it wise to trifle with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont your good sense tell you theres a limit even to such folly as mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant give you what i havent got to give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i want what you have got to give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he eyed her with cynical amused suspicion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did you call me mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> usually you dont call me at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its been weeks since you have called me mister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was your doing it just then one of those subtle adroit timely tricks of yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was the picture of puzzled innocence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellperhaps you dont said he doubtfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate dont call me mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always think of you as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that ive said it i dont find it strange <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with an expression between appeal and mockery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youd only let me get acquainted with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you make me feel that ive got to be careful with youthat i must be on my guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know against whatfor you are certainly the very best friend that ive ever had the only real friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he frowned and bit his lipand felt uncomfortable though he protested to himself that he was simply irritated at her slyness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she went on theres no reason for being on guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with sweet gravity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps i shouldnt if you didnt talk about love to me and kiss me in a way i feel youve no right to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he laid his hands upon her shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time he gazed angrily into her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or are you making a fool of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i certainly am very foolish was her apologetic answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know a lot of things like you and father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he had the maddening sense of being baffled againof having got nowhere of having demonstrated afresh to himself and to her his own weakness where she was concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had there ever been such another case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how little he had known of the possibil ities of the relations of men and womenhe who had prided himself on knowing all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said you are going to marry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose so replied he sourly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you worried about the expense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it costing you too much this helping father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you sorry you went into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you feel that you are wasting your money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his generosity forbade him to keep up the pretense that might aid him in his project <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flushed hung his head in shame before his own weakness as he added in complete surrender im very glad to be helping your father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she flung her arms round his neck and kissed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said with a foolishly delighted laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe we are beginning to get acquainted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are coming to your senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only she laid a beautiful white pleading hand upon his shoulder and gazed earnestly into his eyesplease dont frighten me with that talk and those other kisses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come round in your own way he said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to hurry you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose every bird has its own way of dropping from a perch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was said archly but also in the way that always made him vaguely uneasy made him feel like one facing a mystery which should be explored cautiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is graceful he admitted with a smile since he could not venture to frown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughedand he could not but feel that the greater laughter in her too innocent eyes was directed at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she talked of other thingsand he let her charmed yet cursing his folly his slavery the while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many a time he had pitied a woman for letting him get away from her when she obviously wished to hold him and failed solely because she did not understand her business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like every other man he no sooner began to be attracted by a woman than he began to invest her with a mystery and awe which she either could dissipate by forcing him to see the truth of her commonplaceness or could increase into a power that would enslave him by keeping him agitated and interested and ever satisfied yet ever baffled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no woman had shown this supreme skill in the art of loveuntil dorothy hallowell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she kept him so restless that his professional work was all but neglected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was she simply leading him on and on guided blindly by womans instinct to get as much as she could and to give as little as she dared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or was she protected by a real indifference to himthe strongest indeed the only invulnerable armor a woman can wear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or was it merely that he weakened by his infatuation was doing the protecting for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside these distracting questions the once all important matter of professional and worldly ambition seemed not worth troubling about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they even so vexed him that he had become profoundly indifferent as to josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were alone he either talked neutral subjects or sat almost mute hardly conscious of her presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he received her efforts at the customary caressings with such stolidity that she soon ceased to annoy him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they reduced their outward show of affection to a kiss when they met another when they separated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was tiredalways tired worn outhalf sickharassed by business concerns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not trouble himself about whether his listless excuses would be accepted or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not care what she thoughtor might thinkor might do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> josephine was typical of the women of the comfortable class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for them the fundamentally vital matters of lifethe profoundly harassing questions of food clothing and shelterare arranged and settled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is there left to occupy their minds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little but the idle emotions they manufacture and spread foglike over their true natures to hide the barrenness the monotony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they fool with phrases about art or love or religion or charityfor none of those things can be vivid realities to those who are swathed and stupefied in a luxury they have not to take the least thought to provide for themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like all those women josephine fancied herself complexfancied she was a person of variety and of depth because she repeated with a slight change of wording the things she read in clever books or heard from clever men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there seemed to norman to be small enough originality personality to the ordinary man of the comfortable class but there was some because his necessity of struggling with and against his fellow men in the several arenas of active life compelled him to be at least a little of a person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the women there seemed nothing at allnot even in josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he listened to her when he thought of her nowhe was calmly critical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he judged her as a human specimenjudged much as would have old newton hallowell to whom the whole world was mere laboratory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she bored him nowand he made no effort beyond bare politeness to conceal the fact from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the situation was saved from becoming intolerable by that universal saver of intolerable situations vanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had the ordinary human vanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in addition she had the peculiar vanity of woman the creation of mans flatteries lavished upon the sex he alternately serves and spurns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in further addition she had the vanity of her classthe comfortable class that feels superior to the mass of mankind in fortune in intellect in taste in everything desirable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heaped upon all these vanities was her vanity of high social rankand atop the whole her vanity of great wealth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none but the sweetest and simplest of human beings can stand up and remain human under such a weight as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we are at all fair in our judgments of our fellow men we marvel that the triumphant classespecially the women whose point of view is never corrected by the experiences of practical lifeare not more arrogant more absurdly forgetful of the oneness and the feebleness of humanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> josephine was by nature one of the sweet and simple souls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and her love for norman after the habit of genuine love had destroyed all the instinct of coquetry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the womanor the manhas to be indeed interesting indeed an individuality to remain interesting when sincerely in love and so elevated above the petty but potent sex trickeries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> josephine deeply in love was showing herself to norman in her undisguised natural sweet simplicityand monotony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while men admire and reverence a sweet and simple feminine soul and love her in plays and between the covers of a book and when she is talking highfaluting abstractions of moralityand wax wroth with any other man who ignores or neglects herthey do not in their own persons become infatuated with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> passion is too much given to moods for that it has a morbid craving for variety for the mysterious and the baffling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only thing that saves the race from ruin through passion is the rarity of those by nature or by art expert in using it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman felt that he was paying the penalty for his persistent search for this rarity one of the basest tricks of destiny upon man is to give him what he wantswealth or fame or power or the wom an who enslaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman felt that destiny had suddenly revealed its resolve to destroy him by giving him not one of the things he wanted but all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marriage was not quite two weeks away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about the time that the ordinary plausible excuses for normans neglect his abstraction his seeming indifference were exhausted josephines vanity came forward to explain everything to her all to her own glory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the elysian hour approachedso vanity assured herthe man who loved her as her complex soul and many physical and social advantages deserved was overcome with that shy terror of which she had read in the poets and the novelists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a large income fashionable attire and surroundings a carriage and a maidthese things gave a woman a subtle and superior intellect and soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but everyone admitted indeed saw the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> further these beingsthese great ladiesaccording to all the accredited poets novelists and other final authorities upon lifealways inspired the most awed and worshipful and diffident feelings in their lovers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore shethe great ladywas getting but her due <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would have liked something else something common and humanmuch better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but having always led her life as the conventions dictated never as the common human heart yearned she had no keen sense of dissatisfaction to rouse her to revolt and to question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also she was breathlessly busy with trousseau and the other arrangements for the grand wedding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one afternoon she telephoned norman asking him to come on his way home that evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i particularly wish to see you she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought her voice sounded rather queer but he did not take sufficient interest to speculate about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he was with her in the small drawing room on the second floor he noted that her eyes were regarding him strangely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he arent you going to kiss me fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put on his goodnatured slightly mocking smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you were too busy for that sort of thing nowadays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he bent and kissed her waiting lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he lit a cigarette and seated himself on the sofa beside herthe sofa at right angles to the open fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gazed into the fire for full a minute before she said in a voice of constraint what became of that that girlthe miss hallowell she broke off abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a pause choked with those dizzy pulsations that fill moments of silence and strain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with a sob she flung herself against his breast and buried her face in his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put his arm about her shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he in the kindly gentle tone we can all assume when a matter that agitates some one else is wholly indifferent to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> becauseit was aa trap she answered hysterically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fredthere was a man here this afternoon a man named tetlow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got in only because he said he came from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he used to be your head clerkdidnt he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and one of my few friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried sitting upright and speaking with energy that quivered in her voice and flashed in her fine brown eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes your enemya snake in the grassa malicious poisonous normans quiet even laugh interrupted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything he said would be what he honestly believedanything he said about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pleaded that he was doing it for your good she went on with scorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they always dolike the people that write father wicked anonymous letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he this man tetlowhe said he wanted me for the sake of my love for you to save you from yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman glanced at her with amused eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then you are doing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again she put her head upon his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and id be a poor sort if i let a sneak shake my confidence in you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he patted her shoulder and there was laughter in his voice as he said but i never professed to be trustworthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i know you used to she laughed and kissed his cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while you were engaged to meabout to marry mewhy you simply couldnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you want me to tell you what he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seem to want to get rid of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat upright and looked at him for encouragement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went on he said that if i asked you you would not dare deny you wereweregiving her money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then her lips smiled bravely and she said he didnt say anything about her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was my own correction of his story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with wonder and doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wish to put it that way said he carelessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my money pays the billsall the bills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he studied her face then rose took a final pull at the cigarette tossed it in the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must be going he said in a cool even voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she started up in a panic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not likethis sort of thing he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely im entitled to an explanation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have evidently found an explanation that satisfies you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew himself up in a quiet gesture of haughtiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides it has never been my habit to allow myself to be questioned or to explain myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> precisely what i say said he in the same cool inevitable way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man came to you with a story about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sufficient answer to the story was that i am marrying you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that answer apparently does not content you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt him going and going finally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seized him with desperate fingers cried i am content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh freddont frighten me this way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you afraid of the scandalbecause everything for the wedding has gone so far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried sheperhaps too vigorously a woman would have thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what else is there for me to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you certainly havent shown any consideration for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you told me yourself that you were false to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she forgot her fear in a gush of rage rising from sudden realization of what she was doingof how leniently and weakly and without pride she was dealing with this man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt you admit pardon me said he and his manner might well have calmed the wildest tempest of anger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i leave that to people of the sort who explain and excuse and apologize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply told you i was paying the expenses of a family named hallowell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but why should you do it fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought tetlow told you why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could understand how the opposition witnesses dreaded facing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know just why she stammered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me you were admitting i mean you were confirming what that man accused you of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of what did he accuse me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might say of what do you accuse me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she remained silent he went on i am trying to be reasonable josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am trying to keep my temper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the look in her eyesthe fear the timiditywas a startling revelation of characterof the cowardice with which love undermines the strongest nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know ive been foolish and incoherent fred she pleaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you remember how i always was afraid of that girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just what do you wish to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to be admiring you for your generosityyour charity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its neither the one nor the other said he with exasperating deliberateness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are driving me crazy with your evasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pleadingly you must admit they are evasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he buttoned his coat in tranquil preparation to depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my fault not asking you straight out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you are too cross with me thendont tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughed nervously hiding her submission beneath a seeming of mocking exaggeration of humility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man who admired her as a figure a man who liked her a man who had no feeling for her beyond the general human feeling of wishing well pretty nearly everybodyin brief any man but one who had loved her and had gotten over it would have deeply pitied and sympathized with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred norman said his look and i am backing mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hallowell in a company for which he is doing chemical research work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are hatching eggs out of the shell so to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also we are aging and rejuvenating arthropods and the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far we have declared no dividends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave a hysterical sob of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then its only businessnot the girl at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes its the girl too replied he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes an officer of the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact it was to make a place for her that i went into the enterprise originally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with an engaging air of frankness he inquired anything more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was gazing soberly almost somberly into the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll not be offended if i ask you one question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there anything between you andher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean am i having an affair with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hung her head but managed to make a slight nod of assent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no not thus far my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laughed a third time with still stronger and stranger mockery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she congratulated me on my engagement with a sincerity that would have piqued a man who was interested in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what ive just been feeling and saying and putting you throughits beneath both of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose a woman no womancan help being nasty where another woman is concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with his satirical goodhumored smile i dont in the least blame you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youll not think less of me for giving way to a thing so vulgar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kissed her with a carelessness that made her wince but she felt that she deserved itand was grateful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said why dont you go over and see for yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt tetlow gave you the address and no doubt you have remembered it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she colored and hastily turned her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you want me to take you over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the laboratory would interest youand miss hallowell is lovelier than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has an easier life now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> office work wears on women terribly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> josephine looked at him with a beautiful smile of love and trust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wish to be sure im cured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well cant you see that i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see why you should be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive said nothing one way or the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think the only reason i had the attack was because mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow so evidently believed he was speaking the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt he did think he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure in the same circumstances id think of anyone else just what he thinks of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then why do you do it fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt fair to the girl is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one but you and tetlow knows im doing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow says a great many people down town are talking about itthat they say you go almost every day to jersey city to see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he accuses you of having ruined her reputation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says she is quite innocent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he blames the whole thing upon you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman standing with arms folded upon his broad chest was gazing thoughtfully into the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont mind my telling you these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i know they are lies so everyone is talking about it interrupted he so absorbed that he had not heard her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont realize how conspicuous you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant afford to be mixed up in a scandal she ventured or to injure a poor little creature im afraid youll have toto stop it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes gleamed with mirth and something else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt my habit to heed gossip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a generous thoughtful dear you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill admit i dont like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not jealousbut i wish you werent doing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed with sudden energy that astonished and disquieted her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but since it cant be helped i shall go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had she respected him so profoundly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time she had measured strength with him and had been beaten and routed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she fancied herself enormously proud for she labored under the common delusion which mistakes for pride the silly vanity of class or birth or wealth or position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had imagined she would never lower that cherished pride of hers to any man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she had lowered it into the dust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder women had loved him she said to herself couldnt he do with them even the haughtiest of them precisely as he pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not tried to calm much less to end her jealousy on the contrary he had let it flame as high as it would had urged it higher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she did not dare ask him even as a loving concession to her weakness to give up an affair upon which everybody was putting the natural worst possible construction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary she had given him leave to go on because she fearedyes knewthat if she tried to interfere he would take it as evidence that they could not get on together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was more to come that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he was finishing dressing for dinner his sister ursula knocked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ursula in a gown that displayed the last possible many of the homelier women said impossibleinch of her beautiful shoulders came strolling sinuously in and seated herself on the arm of the divan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she watched him in his evening shirt as he with much struggling did his tie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how young you do look fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> especially in just that much clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not exactly a nonogenarian retorted he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but usually your facein spite of its smoothness and no wrinkleshas a kind of an old youngor do i mean young old?look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve led such a serious life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no im not bad for thirtyfour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people half believe me when i say im twentynine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she glanced complacently down at her softly glistening shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a mighty good one it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> best i ever saw except one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reflected a moment then smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hers is good but not notable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eyes and teeth are her strongholds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean the one in jersey city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went on brushing his hair with not a glance at the bomb she had exploded under his very nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre a cool one she said admiringly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure you never dreamed i knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slid into his white waistcoat and began to button it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though you might know id find out she went on when everyones talking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everyones always talking said he indifferently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they rattle on to beat the band when they get a chance at a man like you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know what theyre saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> loosen these straps in the back of my waistcoatthe upper ones wont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she fussed with the buckles she said but you dont know that they say youre going to pieces neglecting your caseskeeping away from your office wasting about half of your day with your lady love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say that you have gone stark madthat you are rushing to ruin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and everyones wondering when josephine will hear and go on the rampage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes so proud and so stuck on herself that theyre betting shell give you the bounce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well getting into his coatyoud delight in that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes all right as women go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know we women dont ever think any too well of each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now im frank to admit im not worth the powder to blow me up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant do anything worth doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know anything worth knowingexcept how to dress and make a fool of an occasional man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not a good house keeper nor a good wifeand id as lief go to jail for two years as have a baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most women are as poor excuses as i am yet they think theyre grand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman standing before his sister and smiling mysteriously said my dear urse let me give you a great truth in a sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the value of anything is not its value to itself or in itself but its value to some one else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a womaneven as incompetent a person as you or josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or josephinemay seem to some man to be pricelessly valuable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if she happens to seem so to him why she is so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then ursula but suppose josephine hears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood beside the doorway waiting for her to pass out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were talking about it this afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont stoop to that sort of thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you rise to heights of deception that would make anyone else giddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh id give anything to have heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres nothing to deceive about said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant put it over me fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve never before made a fool of yourself about a woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive observed that the women who do the most extraordinary things with men are the most ordinary sort of women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not to the men said he bitterly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does she seem extraordinary to you still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thrust his hands deep in his pockets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she threw back her head looked at him admiringly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had she so utterly worshiped this wonderful powerful brother of hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was in lovereally madly in loveat last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long do you think it will hold fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yetcaring for her you can go on and marry another woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at his sister cynically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wouldnt have me marry her would you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course not protested she hastily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her passion for romance did not carry her to that idiocy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes a sort of working girlisnt she?anyhow that class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how can you marry another woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could i give up josephine?and give her up probably to bob culver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butwhat are you going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps break it off when i marryif you can call it breaking off when theres nothing to break butme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont mean she cried stopping when her tone had carried her meaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesthats the kind of damn fool ive been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have let her see how crazy you were about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was anyone ever able to hide that sort of insanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ursula gazed wonderingly at him drew a long breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must be a deep onedangerous said ursula furious against the woman who was daring to resist her matchless brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred im wild to see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe id see something thatd help cure you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you keep out of it he replied curtly but not with ill humor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itd do for me if it did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marriage will settle everything said ursula with confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its got to said he grimly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day or the next but one dorothy telephoned him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he often called her up on one pretext or another or frankly for no reason at all beyond the overwhelming desire to hear her voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she had never before disturbed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had again and again assured her that he would not regard himself as disturbed no matter what he might be doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would not have it so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he was always watching for some faint sign that she was really interested in him this call gave him a thrill of hopea specimen of the minor absurdities of those days of extravagant folly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father asked me to call up and make sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a business person retorted she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know better than to annoy you as ive often said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew it was foolish tiresome yet he could not resist the impulse to say now that ive heard your voice i cant stay away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shrank and quivered like a boy who has been publicly rebuked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill come when you say he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a minute before four oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a long timenow youve made me crazy to see you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must go back to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> molly did the sweeping and is cleaning windows now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one knows that better than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i want to have a picture of you to look at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got on an old white skirt and an old shirt waist both dirty and a pair of tennis shoes that were white once but are gray now where they arent black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ive got a pink chiffon rag tied round my hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pink is wonderful when you wear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and my face is streakedand my arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh youve got your sleeves rolled up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no im thinking of your arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was used to her treating compliment and flattery from him in that fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could notor was it would not?understand why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had learned that she was not at all the indifferent and unaware person in the matter of her physical charms he had at first fancied her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary she had more than her share of physical vanitynot more than was her right in view of her charms but more than she could carry off well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with many a secret smile he had observed that she thought herself perfect physically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this did not repel him it never does repel a manwhen and so long as he is under the enchantment of the charms the woman more or less exaggerates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while he had often seen women with inordinate physical vanity so often that he had come to regarding it as an essential part of feminine character never before had he seen one so content with her own good opinion of herself that she was indifferent to appreciation from others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not go back to the office after lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several important matters were coming up if he got within reach they might conspire to make it impossible for him to be with her on time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if his partners his clients knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he the important man of affairs kneeling at the feet of a nobody!and why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chiefly because he was unable to convince her that he amounted to anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat in a corner in the dining room of the lawyers club and drank one whisky and soda after another and brooded over his follies and his unhappiness muttering monotonously from time to time no wonder she makes a fool of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i invite it i beg for it damned idiot that i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by three oclock he had drunk enough liquor to have dispatched the average man for several days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had produced no effect upon him beyond possibly a slight aggravation of his moodiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took only twenty minutes to get from new york to her house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he set out at a few minutes after three arrived at twenty minutes to four <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as experience of her ways had taught him that she was much less friendly when he disobeyed her requests he did not dare go to the house but after looking at it from a corner two blocks away made a detour that would use up some of the time he had to waste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as he wandered he indulged in his usual alternations between selfderision and passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he appeared at the house at five minutes to four <end> <end> 
<start> <start> patrick who with molly his wife looked after the domestic affairs was at the front gate gazing down the street in the direction from which he always came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sight of him pat came running <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman quickened his pace and every part of his nervous system was in turmoil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three quarters of an hour ago sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came from the lobatry walked in the sitting room where miss dorothy was oiling the furniture and i was oiling the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he sets downand he looks at heras cool and calm as could beand he says dorothy my child im dying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she stands up straight and looks at him curious likejust curious like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he shivers and i jumps up just in time to catch him from rolling to the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was dead thenso the doctor says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went on to the house pat walking beside him and chattering on and ona stream of words norman did not hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he entered the open front door dorothy came down the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had thought he knew how white her skin was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he did not know until then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from that ghostly pallor looked the eyes of grief beyond tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she seemed to be wrapped in an atmosphere of aloofness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt himself a stranger and an alien <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a brief silence she said i dont realize it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been upstairs where pat carried himbut i dont realize it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know what he wished to say to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess he felt this coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> probably it came quicker than he expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i can see that he hasnt been well for several days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he would never let anything about illness be said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought talking of those things made them worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have relativessomebody you wish me to telegraph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our relatives out west are second cousins or further away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tears sprang to his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there were no tears in her eyes no forlornness in her voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was simply stating a fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said ill look after everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont give it a moments thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll give me something to dosomething to do for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see its my last chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she turned to ascend the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something to do she repeated dully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i hadnt cleaned house this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be something more to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this jarred on himthen brought the tears to his eyes again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how childish she was!and how desolate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate i want to feel that you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id rather you didnt stay she said in the same calm remote way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id rather be alone with him this last time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill go up and sit there until they take him away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thenin a few days ill see what to do ill send for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant leave you at such a time he cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you do you will need some one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and i understood each other in some ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know hed not wantanyone round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at her slight hesitation before anyone he winced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must be alone with him she went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you but i want to go now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then seeing the shadow of annoyance on her beautiful white face he rose and said im going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only want to help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he extended his hand impulsively drew it back before she had the chance to refuse it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he felt that she would refuse it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said you know you can rely on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont need anybody replied she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i can do anything pat will telephone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found pat in the front yard and arranged with him to get news and to send messages by way of the drug store at the corner so that she would know nothing about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went to a florists in new york and sent masses of flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thenthere was nothing more to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped in at the club and drank and gambled until far into the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fretted gloomily about all the next day riding alone in the park driving with his sister drinking and gambling at the club again and smiling cynically to himself at the covert glances his acquaintances exchanged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was growing used to those glances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cared not the flip of a penny for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the third day came the funeral and he went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not let his cabman turn in behind the one carriage that followed the hearse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the graveyard he stood afar off watching her in her simple new black noting her calm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed thinner but he thought it might be simply her black dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could see no change in her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she was leaving the grave she looked in his direction but he was uncertain whether she had seen him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pat and molly were in the big gloomy looking carriage with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ventured to go to the front gate an hour later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its no use to go in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes shut up in her own room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were afraid her mind will give way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes a queer young ladyas queer as she looksthough at first youd never think it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never seen so many persons in one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant molly make her cry?by talking about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why miss dorothy talks about him just as if he was still here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pat wiped the sweat from his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been in many a house of mourning but never through such a strain as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow i feel as if id never before been round where there was anyone thatd lost somebody they really cared about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weeping and moaning dont amount to much beside what shes doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman stayed round for an hour or more then rushed away distracted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drank like a madman drank himself into a daze and so got a few hours of a kind of sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was looking haggard and wild now and everyone avoided him though in fact there was not the least danger of an outburst of temper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his sisterjosephinethe officeseveral clients telephoned for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to all he sent the same refusalthat he was too ill to see anyone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not until the third day after the funeral did dorothy telephone for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took an icecold bath got himself together as well as he could and reached the house in jersey city about half past three in the afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she came gliding into the room like a ghost trailing a black negligee that made the whiteness of her skin startling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eye lids were heavy and dark but unreddened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gazed at him with calm clear melancholy and his heart throbbed and ached for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seated herself clasped ive sent for you so that i could settle things up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are only the papershis notesand he wrote out the addresses of the men they were to be sent to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i mean settle things up with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mustnt bother about that said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shant pretend im going to try to pay you back she went on as if he had not spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you will get part at least by selling this furniture and the things at the laboratory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you understand youre to stay on here just the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what sort of man do you think i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did this for you and you know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i did it for my father replied she and hes gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was resting her melancholy gaze upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt take anything from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt think i was that kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cared nothing about the scandalwhat people saidso long as i was doing it for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id have done anything for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i thought you were going to compel me to do things id have hated to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope i wronged you but i feared you meant that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat thinking several minutes sighed wearily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i neednt bother about it any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorothy lets not talk of these things now said norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to wait until you are calm and have thought everything over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then im sure youll see that you ought to stay on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> am i demanding anything of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know im notand that i never shall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theres no reason on earth why you should support me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i didnt if i stayed on here what sort of woman would i be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was unable to find an answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was trying not to see a look in her faceor was it in her soul revealed through her eyes?a look that made him think for the first time of a resemblance between her and her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see yourself ive got to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any money i could earn wouldnt more than pay for a room and board somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can let me advance you money while you he hesitated had an idea which he welcomed eagerly while you study for the stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you will be able to make a decent living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive no talent for it and no liking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman i must go back to workand right away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at least wait until youve looked into the stage business he urged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may find that you like it and that you have talent for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant take any more from you she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think i am not to be trusted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not going to say now how i feel toward you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i can honestly say one thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that you are all alone and unprotected you neednt have the least fear of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see you dont believe me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow and he has given me a place at twelve a week in his office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman sank back in his chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is in for himself now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes head clerk for pitchley culver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want you to go into culvers office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know he stands wellas well as i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i cant trust you with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i can trust myself she said quietly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butwhy shouldnt you come back with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill see that you get a much better position than culvers giving you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over her face crept one of those mysterious transformations that made her so bafflingly fascinating to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind that worldlywise satirical mask was she mocking at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all she said was i couldnt work there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ive found a place to live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pat and molly will take care of things for you here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre not going to break off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shant see you againexcept as we may meet by accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you realize what youre saying means to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you know how i love you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood and waited passively looking at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorothymy lovedo you want to kill me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when are you to be married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what have i ever done that you should treat me this way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he caught her unresisting hands and kissed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dearmy deardont you care for me at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seized her in his arms kissed her with a frenzy that was savage ferocious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he added unconscious that he was speaking his thoughts so distracted was he you must love meyou must <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no woman has ever resisted me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she drew herself away from him stood before him like snow like ice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing i have never told you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill tell you now she said deliberately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell back a step and the chill of her coldness seemed to be freezing the blood in his veins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive always despised you she went on and he shivered before that contemptuous wordit seemed only the more contemptuous for her calmness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes ive despised you thoroughlyagain only a littlebut always that feeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he thought she had at last stung his pride into the semblance of haughtiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was able to look at her with mocking eyes and to say i congratulate you on your cleverness in concealing your feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wasnt my cleverness she said wearily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no you never have he replied sincerely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps i deserve to be despised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again perhaps if you knew the worldthe one i live inbetter youd think less harshly of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think harshly of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could i after all you did for my father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dorothy if youll stay here and study for the stageor anything you choosei promise you ill never speak of my feeling for youor show it in any wayunless you yourself give me leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ought not to tempt me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you want me to keep on despising you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you ever be fair with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sad frank gentleness of the appeal swung his unhinged mind to the other extremefrom the savagery of passion to a frenzy of remorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he cried because i love you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im capable of any baseness to get you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in going youre saving me from myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hesitated stared wildly appalled at the words that were fighting for utterancethe words about marriageabout marrying her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said hoarsely i am madmad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what im saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodby for gods sake dont think the worst of me dorothy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will be a man againi will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he wrung her hand and talking incoherently he rushed from the room and from the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went straight home and sought his sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had that moment come in from tea after a matinee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she talked about the playhow badly it was acted and about the women she had seen at teahow badly dressed they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its hard to say which is the more dreadfulthe ugly misshapen human race without clothes or in the clothes it insists on wearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the talk at that tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does no one ever say a pleasant thing about anyone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doesnt anyone ever do a pleasant thing that can be spoken about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i read this morning tolstoys advice about resolving to think all day only nice thoughts and sticking to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that sounded good to me and i decided to try it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ursula laughed and squirmed about in her tightfitting dress that made an enchanting display of her figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant be a fraud for one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i had stuck to my resolution id have spent the day in lying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that her attention was attracted she observed more closely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive broken with her replied he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why fred you cant you cantwith the wedding only five days away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said cheerfully ohwith the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youll stick it out fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve made a fool of yourself long enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was the girl playing for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> women do that sort of fool thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but menneverat least not the ambitious snobbish new york men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least i almost did it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had stayed a minute longer id have done it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you like to think you would mocked ursula <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you had tried to say the words your lungs would have collapsed your vocal chords snapped and your tongue shriveled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not so damn sure i shant do it yet he burst out fiercely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am said ursula calm brisk practical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a woman go to work when she neednt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how easily women fool men!even the wise men like you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she still hopes to marry youor she has heard of your marriage norman lifted his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into his face came the cynical suspicious expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and has fastened on some other man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or perhaps shes found some good provider whos willing to marry her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman sprang up his eyes blazing his mouth working cruelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a manin such a deliriummight commit any absurdity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flung himself down in despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> urse why cant i get rid of this thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your good sense tells you if you had her youd be over it she snapped her fingerslike that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he groaned she has broken with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ursula went to him and kissed him and took his head in her arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh it must be dreadful to have always had whatever one wanted and then to find something one cant have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we women are used to itand the usual sort of man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not your sort freddyand im so sorry for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want her ursei want her he groaned and he was almost sobbing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my god i cant get on without her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now freddy dear listen to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know shes way way beneath youthat she isnt at all what youve got in the habit of picturing herthat its all delusion and nonsense i want her he repeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd be ashamed if you had her as a wife wouldnt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a low sort of cunning yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not brainsnot enough to hold you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes got enough for a woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she isnt to be compared with josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but which do you want to marry?to bring forward as your wife?to spend your life with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but urse i cant help it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive used every weapon ive got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my sense of humorand it weakened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant understand heri cant touch her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she keeps me going like a man chasing an echo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a man chasing an echo repeated ursula reflectively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she must be cleverin her way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god knows which i dontand sometimes i think she doesnt either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made a gesture of dismissal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must pull myself togetheror try to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will said his sister confidently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fortnight from now youll be laughing at yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had to go and dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she could not leave until she had tried to make him comfortable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was drinking brandy and soda and staring at his feet which were stretched straight out toward the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> throw yourself on your sense of humor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a friend that sticks when all others fail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my only hope he said with a grim smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes crazy about you ill bet anything you like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before youre through with this youll find out im right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thenyoull have no use for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really fred it irritates me to see you absolutely unlike yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why youre as brokenspirited as a henpecked old husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just that he admitted rising and looking drearily about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what the devil to do next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> going to see josephine this evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose so was his indifferent reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have to dress after dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought he would not go to josephine but would hide in his club and drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toward nine oclock he in evening dress with the expression of a horse in a treadmill rang the bell of josephines house and passed in at the big bronze doors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the butler must have particularly admired the way he tossed aside his coat and hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as he was in the presence of his fiancee he saw that she was again in the throes of some violent agitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she began at once ive just had the most frightful scene with father she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes been hearing a lot of stuff about you down town and it set him wild <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mind if i smoke a cigar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he looking at her unseeingly with haggard cold eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and may i have some whisky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope the servants didnt hear him she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as a step sounded outside she put on an air of gayety as if she were still laughing at some jest he had made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the doorway appeared her father one of those big men who win half the battle in advance on personal appearance of unconquerable might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burroughs was noted for his generosity and for his violent temper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a rule men of the largeness necessary to handling large affairs are free from petty vindictiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are too busy for hatred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they do not forgive they are most careful not to forget they simply stand ready at any moment to do whatever it is to their interest to do regardless of friendships or animosities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burroughs was an exception in that he got his highest pleasure out of pursuing his enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he enjoyed this so keenly that several timesso it was saidhe had sacrificed real money to satisfy a revenge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but these rumors may have wronged him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is hardly probable that a man who would let a weakness carry him to that pitch of folly could have escaped destruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for of all the follies revenge is the most dangerous as well as the most fatuous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he looked less powerful the bigness of his features the spread of cheek and jowl would have been grotesque <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was the face was impressive especially when one recalled how many many millions he owned and how many more he controlled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the control was better than the ownership <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the millions he owned made him a cowardhe was afraid he might lose them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the millions he controlled and of course used for his own enrichment made him brave for if they were lost in the daring ventures in which he freely staked them why the loss was not his and he could shift the blame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> usually norman treated him with great respect for his business gave the firm nearly half its total income and it was his daughter and his wealth prestige and power that norman was marrying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this evening he looked at the great man with a superciliousness that was peculiarly disrespectful from so young a man to one well advanced toward old age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman had been feeling relaxed languid exhausted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the signs of battle in that powerful face nerved him keyed him up at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waited with a joyful impatience while the servant was bringing cigars and whisky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the enormous quantities of liquor he had drunk in the last few days had not been without effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alcohol the general stimulant inevitably brings out in strong relief a mans dominant qualities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dominant quality of norman was love of combat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> josephine tells me you are in a blue fury said norman pleasantly when the door was closed and the three were alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the covert insolence of his tone josephine became violently agitated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father she said with the imperiousness of an only and indulged child i have asked you not to interfere between fred and me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i had your promise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said id think about it replied her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a heavy voice that now and then awoke some string of the lower octaves of the piano in the corner to a dismal groan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its that silly story we were talking about the other day fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burroughs he laughed amiablyat least not a cigar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor only allows me one and ive had it replied burroughs his eyes sparkling viciously at this flick of the whip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the truth about that business norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> normans amused glance encountered the savage glare mockingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because my daughters happiness is at stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i cannot but resent a low scandal about a man who wishes to marry my daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very proper sir said norman graciously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my daughter continued burroughs with accele rating anger tells me you have denied the story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have asked you not to interfere between norman interrupted with an astonished look at josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she colored gazed at him imploringly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when body and mind are in health and at rest the fullness of the face hides the character to a great extent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when a human being is sick or very tired the concealing roundness goes and in the clearly marked features the true character is revealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in normans face haggard by his wearing emotions his character stood forththe traits of strength of tenacity of inevitable purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but burroughs went on i have it on the best authority that it is true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman looking into the fascinating face of danger was thrilled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you wish to break off the engagement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said in the gentlest smoothest tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burroughs brought his fist down on the tableand norman recognized the gesture of the bluffer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you to break off with that woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i insist upon itupon positive assurances from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had long been looking for a justifying grievance against her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it now seemed to him that he had found it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said genially but with subtle irony since you are getting your father to speak for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was just enough truth in this to entangle her and throw her into disorder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been afraid of the consequences of her fathers interfering with a man so spirited as norman but at the same time she had longed to have some one put a check upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> normans suave remark made her feel that he could see into her inmost soulcould see the anger the jealousy the doubt the hatredtinged love the lovesaturated hate seething and warring there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burroughs was saying if we had not committed ourselves so deeply i should deal very differently with this matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said normanand josephine gave a piteous gasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if this goes much farther i assure you i shall not be deterred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burroughs firmly planted in a big leather chair looked at the young man in puzzled amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see you think you have us in your power he said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary rejoined the young man i see you believe you have me in your power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in a sense you are not mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father he is right cried josephine agitatedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt love and respect him as i do if he would submit to this hectoring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot discuss this matter properly before you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you will not leave josephine said nor man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing to be said that you cannot and ought not to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not an infant father said josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides it is as fred says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then why does he not say so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> demanded burroughs seeing a chance to recede from his former too advanced position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i told you all about it father said josephine angrily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyve been distorting the truth and the truth is to his credit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman avoided the glance she sent to him it was only a glance and away for more formidably than ever his power was enthroned in his haggard face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood with his back to the fire and it was plain that the muscles of his strong figure were braced to give and to receive a shock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burroughs he said your daughter is mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it is my fault in having helped her to mislead herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plain truth is i have become infatuated with a young woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cares nothing about mehas repulsed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been and am making a fool of myself about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been hoping to cure myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was absolute silence in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norman stole a glance at josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was sitting erect a greenish pallor over her ghastly face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said if she will take me now that she knows the truth i shall be gratefuland i shall make what effort i can to do my best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at her and she at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for an instant her eyes softened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the appeal of weak human heart to weak human heart in his gaze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a brief struggle between vanity and love and vanity the stronger the strongest force in her life dominating it since earliest babyhood and only seeming to give way to love when love cameit was vanity that won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stiffened herself and her mouth curled with proud scorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laugheda sneer of jealous rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father she said the lady in the case is a common typewriter in his office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to menespecially to practical men differences of rank and position among women are not fundamentally impressive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> man is in the habit of taking what he wants in the way of womankind wherever he finds it and he understands that habit in other men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was furious with norman but he did not sympathize with his daughters extreme attitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said to norman you say you have broken with the woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has broken with me replied norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate everything is broken off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there is no reason why the marriage should not go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you understood men you would attach no importance to this matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as you yourself said the woman isnt a lady isnt in our class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that sort of thing amounts to nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has shown the highest kind of honestyhas been truthful where most men would have shifted and lied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow things have gone too far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not without the soundest reasons had burroughs accepted norman as his soninlaw and he had no fancy for giving him up when men of his preeminent fitness were so rare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he returned her gaze the event might have been different for within her there was now going on a struggle between two nearly evenly matched vanitiesthe vanity of her own outraged pride and the vanity of what the world would say and think if the engagement were broken off at that time and in those circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he did not look at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kept his eyes fixed upon the opposite wall and there was no sign of emotion of any kind in his stony features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> josephine rose suppressed a sob looked arrogant scorn from eyes shining with tearstears of self pity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> send him away father she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has tried to degrade me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she rushed from the room her father half starting from his chair to detain her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hell of a mess youve made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hell of a mess replied the young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youve got to do your part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he threw his cigar into the fireplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before you go you must see josie alone and talk with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be useless said norman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> burroughs laid his hand friendlily but heavily upon the young mans shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this outburst of nonsense might cost you two young people your happiness for life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is no time for jealousy and false pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ohtis an expression they use down at talbothays replied angel blushing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment and said no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not till the evening after family prayers that angel found opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind his brothers on the carpet studying the little nails in the heels of their walking boots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the service was over they went out of the room with their mother and mr clare and himself were left alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scaleeither in england or in the colonies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his father then told him that as he had not been put to the expense of sending angel up to cambridge he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day that he might not feel himself unduly slighted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as far as worldly wealth goes continued his father you will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this considerateness on old mr clares part led angel onward to the other and dearer subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he observed to his father that he was then sixandtwenty and that when he should start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matterssome one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would it not be well therefore for him to marry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable what kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hardworking farmer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a truly christian woman who will be a help and a comfort to you in your goingsout and your comingsin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond that it really matters little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such an one can be found indeed my earnestminded friend and neighbour dr chant but ought she not primarily to be able to milk cows churn good butter make immense cheeses know how to sit hens and turkeys and rear chickens to direct a field of labourers in an emergency and estimate the value of sheep and calves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes a farmers wife yes certainly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr clare the elder had plainly never thought of these points before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was going to add he said that for a pure and saintly woman you will not find one more to your true advantage and certainly not more to your mothers mind and my own than your friend mercy whom you used to show a certain interest in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true that my neighbour chants daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round about us for decorating the communion tablealter as i was shocked to hear her call it one daywith flowers and other stuff on festival occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but her father who is quite as opposed to such flummery as i says that can be cured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a mere girlish outbreak which i am sure will not be permanent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes yes mercy is good and devout i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but father dont you think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as miss chant but one who in place of that ladys ecclesiastical accomplishments understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself would suit me infinitely better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmers wifes duties came second to a pauline view of humanity and the impulsive angel wishing to honour his fathers feelings and to advance the cause of his heart at the same time grew specious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that fate or providence had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not say whether or not she had attached herself to the sound low church school of his father but she would probably be open to conviction on that point she was a regular churchgoer of simple faith honesthearted receptive intelligent graceful to a degree chaste as a vestal and in personal appearance exceptionally beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is she of a family such as you would care to marry intoa lady in short <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked his startled mother who had come softly into the study during the conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is not what in common parlance is called a lady said angel unflinchingly for she is a cottagers daughter as i am proud to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she is a lady neverthelessin feeling and nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mercy chant is of a very good family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wanti want stammered massy infuriated and astonishedi want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do you know that i want anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne silenced him with a sort of candid bravado <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the engineers round soft cheeks quiv you are only worrying my head off and sterne met him with a confident little smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a chap in business i know well up in the world he is now used to tell me that this was the proper way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> always push on to the front he would say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep yourself well before your boss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interfere whenever you get a chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i know no other boss than you here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are the owner and no one else counts for that much in my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i make no secret of it that i am one of the sort that means to get on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are the men to make use of sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent arrived at the top of the tree sir without finding that outi dare say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> worry your boss in order to get on mumbled massy as if awestruck by the irreverent originality of the idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt wonder if this was just what the blue anchor people kicked you out of the employ for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is that what you call getting on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you shall get on in the same way here if you arent carefuli can promise you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this sterne hung his head thoughtful perplexed winking hard at the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all his attempts to enter into confidential relations with his owner had led of late to nothing better than these dark threats of dismissal and a threat of dismissal would check him at once into a hesitating silence as though he were not sure that the proper time for defying it had come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this occa sion he seemed to have lost his tongue for a moment and massy getting in motion heavily passed him by with an abortive attempt at shouldering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne defeated it by stepping aside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned then swiftly opening his mouth very wide as if to shout something after the engineer but seemed to think better of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alwaysas he was ready to confesson the lookout for an opening to get on it had become an instinct with him to watch the conduct of his immediate superiors for something that one could lay hold of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was his belief that no skipper in the world would keep his com mand for a day if only the owners could be made to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this romantic and naive theory had led him into trouble more than once but he remained incorrigi ble and his character was so instinctively disloyal that whenever he joined a ship the intention of ousting his commander out of the berth and taking his place was always present at the back of his head as a matter of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it filled the leisure of his waking hours with the reveries of careful plans and compromising discov eriesthe dreams of his sleep with images of lucky turns and favorable accidents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> skippers had been known to sicken and die at sea than which nothing could be better to give a smart mate a chance of showing what hes made of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they also would tumble overboard sometimes he had heard of one or two such cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it were constitutionally he was faithful to the belief that the conduct of no single one of them would stand the test of careful watching by a man who knew whats what and who kept his eyes skinned pretty well all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after he had gained a permanent footing on board the sofala he allowed his perennial hope to rise high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to begin with it was a great advantage to have an old man for captain the sort of man besides who in the nature of things was likely to give up the job before long from one cause or another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne was greatly chagrined however to notice that he did not seem any way near being past his work yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still these old men go to pieces all at once sometimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was the ownerengineer close at hand to be impressed by his zeal and steadiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne never for a moment doubted the obvious nature of his own merits he was really an ex cellent officer only nowadays professional merit alone does not take a man along fast enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a chap must have some push in him and must keep his wits at work too to help him forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made up his mind to inherit the charge of this steamer if it was to be done at all not indeed estimating the command of the sofala as a very great catch but for the reason that out east especially to make a start is everything and one command leads to another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began by promising himself to behave with great circumspection massys somber and fantastic humors intimidated him as being outside ones usual sea experi ence but he was quite intelligent enough to realize al most from the first that he was there in the presence of an exceptional situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his peculiar prying imagina tion penetrated it quickly the feeling that there was in it an element which eluded his grasp exasperated his impatience to get on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so one trip came to an end then another and he had begun his third before he saw an opening by which he could step in with any sort of effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had all been very queer and very obscure something had been going on near him as if separated by a chasm from the common life and the working routine of the ship which was exactly like the life and the routine of any other coasting steamer of that class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then one day he made his discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it came to him after all these weeks of watchful ob servation and puzzled surmises suddenly like the long sought solution of a riddle that suggests itself to the mind in a flash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not with the same authority however <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after remain ing thunderstruck for a few seconds he tried to shake it off with selfcontumely as though it had been the product of an unhealthy bias towards the incredible the inexplicable the unheardofthe mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thisthe illuminating momenthad occurred the trip before on the return passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had just left a place of call on the mainland called pangu they were steaming straight out of a bay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the east a massive headland closed the view with the tilted edges of the rocky strata showing through its ragged clothing of rank bushes and thorny creepers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind had begun to sing in the rigging the sea along the coast green and as if swollen a little above the line of the horizon seemed to pour itself over time after time with a slow and thundering fall into the shadow of the leeward cape and across the wide opening the nearest of a group of small islands stood enveloped in the hazy yellow light of a breezy sunrise still farther out the hummocky tops of other islets peeped out motionless above the water of the channels between scoured tumultuously by the breeze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the usual track of the sofala both going and return ing on every trip led her for a few miles along this reef infested region <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she followed a broad lane of water dropping astern one after another these crumbs of the earths crust resembling a squadron of dismasted hulks run in disorder upon a foul ground of rocks and shoals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of these fragments of land appeared indeed no bigger than a stranded ship others quite flat lay awash like anchored rafts like ponderous black rafts of stone several heavily timbered and round at the base emerged in squat domes of deep green foliage that shuddered darkly all over to the flying touch of cloud shadows driven by the sudden gusts of the squally sea son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thunderstorms of the coast broke frequently over that cluster it turned then shadowy in its whole extent it turned more dark and as if more still in the play of fire as if more impenetrably silent in the peals of thunder its blurred shapes vanisheddissolving ut terly at times in the thick rainto reappear clearcut and black in the stormy light against the gray sheet of the cloudscattered on the slaty round table of the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unscathed by storms resisting the work of years unfretted by the strife of the world there it lay unchanged as on that day four hundred years ago when first beheld by western eyes from the deck of a highpooped caravel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was one of these secluded spots that may be found on the busy sea as on land you come sometimes upon the clustered houses of a hamlet untouched by mens rest lessness untouched by their need by their thought and as if forgotten by time itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lives of uncounted generations had passed it by and the multitudes of sea fowl urging their way from all the points of the horizon to sleep on the outer rocks of the group unrolled the converging evolutions of their flight in long somber streamers upon the glow of the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the palpitating cloud of their wings soared and stooped over the pinna cles of the rocks over the rocks slender like spires squat like martello towers over the pyramidal heaps like fallen ruins over the lines of bald bowlders showing like a wall of stones battered to pieces and scorched by lightning with the sleepy clear glimmer of water in every breach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noise of their continuous and violent screaming filled the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this great noise would meet the sofala coming up from batu beru it would meet her on quiet evenings a piti less and savage clamor enfeebled by distance the clamor of seabirds settling to rest and struggling for a footing at the end of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one noticed it especially on board it was the voice of their ships un erring landfall ending the steady stretch of a hundred miles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had made good her course she had run her distance till the punctual islets began to emerge one by one the points of rocks the hummocks of earth  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the cloud of birds hoveredthe restless cloud emit ting a strident and cruel uproar the sound of the fa miliar scene the living part of the broken land beneath of the outspread sea and of the high sky without a flaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when the sofala happened to close with the land after sunset she would find everything very still there under the mantle of the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all would be still dumb almost invisiblebut for the blotting out of the low constellations occulted in turns behind the vague masses of the islets whose true outlines eluded the eye amongst the dark spaces of the heaven and the ships three lights resembling three starsthe red and the green with the white aboveher three lights like three companion stars wandering on the earth held their unswerving course for the passage at the southern end of the group <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes there were human eyes open to watch them come nearer traveling smoothly in the somber void the eyes of a naked fisherman in his canoe floating over a reef <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fireship that once in every moon goes in and comes out of pangu bay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more he did not know of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and just as he had detected the faint rhythm of the propeller beating the calm water a mile and a half away the time would come for the sofala to alter her course the lights would swing off him their triple beamand disappear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few miserable halfnaked families a sort of outcast tribe of longhaired lean and wildeyed people strove for their living in this lonely wilderness of islets lying like an abandoned outwork of the land at the gates of the bay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within the knots and loops of the rocks the water rested more transparent than crystal under their crooked and leaky canoes scooped out of the trunk of a tree the forms of the bottom undulated slightly to the dip of a paddle and the men seemed to hang in the air they seemed to hang inclosed within the fibers of a dark sodden log fishing patiently in a strange un steady pellucid green air above the shoals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their bodies stalked brown and emaciated as if dried up in the sunshine their lives ran out silently the homes where they were born went to rest and died flimsy sheds of rushes and coarse grass eked out with a few ragged matswere hidden out of sight from the open sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no glow of their household fires ever kindled for a seaman a red spark upon the blind night of the group and the calms of the coast the flaming long calms of the equator the unbreathing concentrated calms like the deep introspection of a passionate nature brooded awfully for days and weeks together over the unchangeable inheritance of their children till at last the stones hot like live embers scorched the naked sole till the water clung warm and sickly and as if thick ened about the legs of lean men with girded loins wad ing thighdeep in the pale blaze of the shallows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it would happen now and then that the sofala through some delay in one of the ports of call would heave in sight making for pangu bay as late as noonday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only a blurring cloud at first the thin mist of her smoke would arise mysteriously from an empty point on the clear line of sea and sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the taciturn fishermen within the reefs would extend their lean arms towards the offing and the brown figures stooping on the tiny beaches the brown figures of men women and children grubbing in the sand in search of turtles eggs would rise up crooked elbow aloft and hand over the eyes to watch this monthly apparition glide straight on swerve offand go by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their ears caught the panting of that ship their eyes followed her till she passed between the two capes of the mainland going at full speed as though she hoped to make her way unchecked into the very bosom of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on such days the luminous sea would give no sign of the dangers lurking on both sides of her path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every thing remained still crushed by the overwhelming power of the light and the whole group opaque in the sun shinethe rocks resembling pinnacles the rocks resem bling spires the rocks resembling ruins the forms of islets resembling beehives resembling molehills the islets recalling the shapes of haystacks the contours of ivyclad towerswould stand reflected together upside down in the unwrinkled water like carved toys of ebony disposed on the silvered plateglass of a mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first touch of blowing weather would envelop the whole at once in the spume of the windward breakers as if in a sudden cloudlike burst of steam and the clear water seemed fairly to boil in all the passages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the provoked sea outlined exactly in a design of angry foam the wide base of the group the submerged level of broken waste and refuse left over from the building of the coast near by projecting its dangerous spurs all awash far into the channel and bristling with wicked long spits often a mile long with deadly spits made of froth and stones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and even nothing more than a brisk breezeas on that morning the voyage before when the sofala left pangu bay early and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sternes discovery was to blossom out like a flower of incredible and evil aspect from the tiny seed of instinctive suspicioneven such a breeze had enough strength to tear the placid mask from the face of the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to sterne gazing with indif ference it had been like a revelation to behold for the first time the dangers marked by the hissing livid patches on the water as distinctly as on the engraved paper of a chart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it came into his mind that this was the sort of day most favorable for a stranger attempt ing the passage a clear day just windy enough for the sea to break on every ledge buoying as it were the channel plainly to the sight whereas during a calm you had nothing to depend on but the compass and the practiced judgment of your eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet the suc cessive captains of the sofala had had to take her through at night more than once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nowadays you could not afford to throw away six or seven hours of a steamers time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then use is everything and with proper care  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the channel was broad and safe enough the main point was to hit upon the entrance correctly in the darkfor if a man got himself involved in that stretch of broken water over yonder he would never get out with a whole ship if he ever got out at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was sternes last train of thought independent of the great discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had just seen to the secur ing of the anchor and had remained forward idling away a moment or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain was in charge on the bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a slight yawn he had turned away from his survey of the sea and had leaned his shoulders against the fish davit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these properly speaking were the very last moments of ease he was to know on board the sofala <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the instants that came after were to be pregnant with pur pose and intolerable with perplexity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no more idle random thoughts the discovery would put them on the rack till sometimes he wished to goodness he had been fool enough not to make it at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet if his chance to get on rested on the discovery of something wrong he could not have hoped for a greater stroke of luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the knowledge was too disturbing really <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something wrong with a vengeance and the moral certitude of it was at first simply frightful to contem plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne had been looking aft in a mood so idle that for once he was thinking no harm of anyone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his captain on the bridge presented himself naturally to his sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how insignificant how casual was the thought that had started the train of discoverylike an accidental spark that suffices to ignite the charge of a tremendous mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caught under by the breeze the awnings of the fore deck bellied upwards and collapsed slowly and above their heavy flapping the gray stuff of captain whalleys roomy coat fluttered incessantly around his arms and trunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he faced the wind in full light with his great silvery beard blown forcibly against his chest the eye brows overhung heavily the shadows whence his glance appeared to be staring ahead piercingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne could just detect the twin gleam of the whites shifting under the shaggy arches of the brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at short range these eyes for all the mans affable manner seemed to look you through and through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne never could defend himself from that feeling when he had occasion to speak with his captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a big heavy man he appeared up there with that little shrimp of a serang in close attendanceas was usual in this extraordinary steamer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely the old fellow could have looked after his ship without that loafing native at his elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne wriggled his shoulders with dis gust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that old skipper must have been growing lazy for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all grew lazy out east here sterne was very conscious of his own unimpaired activity they got slack all over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he towered very erect on the bridge and quite low by his side as you see a small child looking over the edge of a table the battered soft hat and the brown face of the serang peeped over the white canvas screen of the rail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt the malay was standing back nearer to the wheel but the great disparity of size in close associa tion amused sterne like the observation of a bizarre fact in nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were as queer fish out of the sea as any in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw captain whalley turn his head quickly to speak to his serang the wind whipped the whole white mass of the beard sideways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would be directing the chap to look at the compass for him or what not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too much trouble to step over and see for him self <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sternes scorn for that bodily indolence which overtakes white men in the east increased on reflection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of them would be utterly lost if they hadnt all these natives at their beck and call they grew perfectly shameless about it too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not of that sort thank god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wasnt in him to make himself dependent for his work on any shriveledup little malay like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as if one could ever trust a silly native for anything in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that fine old man thought differently it seems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they were together never far apart a pair of them recalling to the mind an old whale at tended by a little pilotfish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fancifulness of the comparison made him smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a whale with an inseparable pilotfish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what the old man looked like for it could not be said he looked like a shark though mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy had called him that very name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy did not mind what he said in his savage fits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne smiled to himselfand gradually the ideas evoked by the sound by the im agined shape of the word pilotfish the ideas of aid of guidance needed and received came uppermost in his mind the word pilot awakened the idea of trust of dependence the idea of welcome cleareyed help brought to the seaman groping for the land in the dark groping blindly in fogs feeling their way in the thick weather of the gales that filling the air with a salt mist blown up from the sea contract the range of sight on all sides to a shrunken horizon that seems within reach of the hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pilot sees better than a stranger because his local knowledge like a sharper vision completes the shapes of things hurriedly glimpsed penetrates the veils of mist spread over the land by the storms of the sea de fines with certitude the outlines of a coast lying under the pall of fog the forms of landmarks half buried in a starless night as in a shallow grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he recognizes be cause he already knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not to his farreaching eye but to his more extensive knowledge that the pilot looks for certitude for this certitude of the ships posi tion on which may depend a mans good fame and the peace of his conscience the justification of the trust deposited in his hands with his own life too which is seldom wholly his to throw away and the humble lives of others rooted in distant affections perhaps and made as weighty as the lives of kings by the burden of the awaiting mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pilots knowledge brings relief and certitude to the commander of a ship the serang however in his fanciful suggestion of a pilotfish at tending a whale could not in any way be credited with a superior knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these two men had come on that run togetherthe white and the brownon the same day and of course a white man would learn more in a week than the best native would in a month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was made to stick to the skipper as though he were of some useas the pilotfish they say is to the whale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if not superior knowledge then  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was repugnant to his imagination shocking to his ideas of honesty shocking to his conception of mankind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this enormity affected ones outlook on what was possible in this world it was as if for instance the sun had turned blue throwing a new and sinister light on men and nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really in the first moment he had felt sickish as though he had got a blow below the belt for a second the very color of the sea seemed changedappeared queer to his wan dering eye and he had a passing unsteady sensation in all his limbs as though the earth had started turning the other way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a very natural incredulity succeeding this sense of upheaval brought a measure of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had gasped it was over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but afterwards during all that day sudden paroxysms of wonder would come over him in the midst of his occupations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would stop and shake his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the revolt of his incredulity had passed away almost as quick as the first emotion of discovery and for the next twentyfour hours he had no sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at mealtimes he took the foot of the table set up for the white men on the bridge he could not help losing himself in a fascinated contemplation of captain whalley opposite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he watched the deliberate upward movements of the arm the old man put his food to his lips as though he never expected to find any taste in his daily bread as though he did not know anything about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fed himself like a somnambulist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its an awful sight thought sterne and he watched the long period of mournful silent immobility with a big brown hand lying loosely closed by the side of the plate till he noticed the two engineers to the right and left look ing at him in astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would close his mouth in a hurry then and lowering his eyes wink rapidly at his plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was awful to see the old chap sitting there it was even awful to think that with three words he could blow him up skyhigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all he had to do was to raise his voice and pronounce a single short sentence and yet that simple act seemed as impossible to attempt as moving the sun out of its place in the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old chap could eat in his terrific mechanical way but sterne from mental excitement could notnot that evening at any rate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had had ample time since to get accustomed to the strain of the mealhours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would never have believed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then use is everything only the very potency of his success prevented anything resembling elation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt like a man who in his legitimate search for a loaded gun to help him on his way through the world chances to come upon a torpedoupon a live torpedo with a shattering charge in its head and a pressure of many atmospheres in its tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the sort of weapon to make its possessor careworn and nervous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had no mind to be blown up himself and he could not get rid of the notion that the explosion was bound to damage him too in some way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this vague apprehension had restrained him at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was able now to eat and sleep with that fearful weapon by his side with the conviction of its power always in mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had not been arrived at by any reflective process but once the idea had entered his head the conviction had followed overwhelmingly in a multitude of observed little facts to which before he had given only a languid attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abrupt and falter ing intonations of the deep voice the taciturnity put on like an armor the deliberate as if guarded move ments the long immobilities as if the man he watched had been afraid to disturb the very air every familiar gesture every word uttered in his hearing every sigh overheard had acquired a special significance a con firmatory import <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every day that passed over the sofala appeared to sterne simply crammed full with proofswith incon trovertible proofs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at night when off duty he would steal out of his cabin in pyjamas for more proofs and stand a full hour perhaps on his bare feet below the bridge as absolutely motionless as the awning stanchion in its deck socket near by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the stretches of easy navigation it is not usual for a coasting captain to re main on deck all the time of his watch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the serang keeps it for him as a matter of custom in open water on a straight course he is usually trusted to look after the ship by himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this old man seemed incapable of remaining quietly down below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt he could not sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly in the silence of the ship panting upon the still dark sea sterne would hear a low voice above him serang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are watching the compass well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ship is making her course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is well and remember serang that the order is that you are to mind the helmsmen and keep a look out with care the same as if i were not on deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when the serang had made his answer the low tones on the bridge would cease and everything round sterne seemed to become more still and more profoundly silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slightly chilled and with his back aching a little from long immobility he would steal away to his room on the port side of the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had long since parted with the last vestige of incredulity of the original emotions set into a tumult by the discovery some trace of the first awe alone remained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the awe of the man himselfhe could blow him up skyhigh with six wordsrather it was an awestruck indignation at the reckless perversity of avarice what else could it be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the mad and somber resolution that for the sake of a few dollars more seemed to set at naught the common rule of conscience and pretended to struggle against the very decree of providence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you could not find another man like this one in the whole round worldthank god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something devilishly dauntless in the character of such a deception which made you pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other considerations occurring to his prudence had kept him tonguetied from day to day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him now that it would yet have been easier to speak out in the first hour of discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he almost regretted not having made a row at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then the very mon strosity of the disclosure  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could hardly face it himself let alone pointing it out to somebody else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover with a desperado of that sort one never knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the object was not to get him out that was as well as done already but to step into his place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bizarre as the thought seemed he might have shown fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fellow up to working such a fraud would have enough cheek for anything a fellow that as it were stood up against god almighty himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a horrid marvelthats what he was he was perfectly capable of brazening out the affair scandalously till he got him sterne kicked out of the ship and everlast ingly damaged his prospects in this part of the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet if you want to get on something must be risked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times sterne thought he had been unduly timid of taking action in the past and what was worse it had come to this that in the present he did not seem to know what action to take <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massys savage moroseness was too disconcerting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an incalculable factor of the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you could not tell what there was behind that insulting ferocity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could one trust such a temper it did not put sterne in bodily fear for himself but it frightened him exceedingly as to his prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though of course inclined to credit himself with ex ceptional powers of observation he had by now lived too long with his discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had gone on looking at nothing else till at last one day it occurred to him that the thing was so obvious that no one could miss seeing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were four white men in all on board the sofala <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack the second engineer was too dull to notice anything that took place out of his engineroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remained massythe ownerthe interested person nearly going mad with worry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne had heard and seen more than enough on board to know what ailed him but his exasperation seemed to make him deaf to cau tious overtures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had only known it there was the very thing he wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how could you bargain with a man of that sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like going into a tigers den with a piece of raw meat in your hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as likely as not to rend you for your pains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact he was always threatening to do that very thing and the urgency of the case combined with the impossibility of handling it with safety made sterne in his watches below toss and mutter openeyed in his bunk for hours as though he had been burning with fever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> occurrences like the crossing of the bar just now were extremely alarming to his prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not want to be left behind by some swift catastrophe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy be ing on the bridge the old man had to brace himself up and make a show he supposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was getting very bad with him very bad indeed now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even massy had been emboldened to find fault this time sterne listen ing at the foot of the ladder had heard the others whimpering and artless denunciations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> luckily the beast was very stupid and could not see the why of all this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however small blame to him it took a clever man to hit upon the cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless it was high time to do something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old mans game could not be kept up for many days more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may yet lose my life at this foolinglet alone my chance sterne mumbled angrily to himself after the stooping back of the chief engineer had disappeared round the corner of the skylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes no doubthe thought but to blurt out his knowledge would not ad vance his prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary it would blast them utterly as likely as not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a vague consciousness of not being much liked by his fellows in this part of the world inex plicably enough for he had done nothing to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people were always down on a clever chap who made no bones about his determination to get on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to do your duty and count on the gratitude of that brute massy would be sheer folly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a brute without a spark of anything human about him without so much as simple curiosity even or else surely he would have responded in some way to all these hints he had been given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massys state of exasperation seemed to sterne to have made him stupid beyond the ordinary silliness of shipowners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne meditating on the embarrassments of that stu pidity forgot himself completely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his stony unwink ing stare was fixed on the planks of the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slight quiver agitating the whole fabric of the ship was more perceptible in the silent river shaded and still like a forest path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sofala gliding with an even motion had passed beyond the coastbelt of mud and mangroves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shores rose higher in firm slop ing banks and the forest of big trees came down to the brink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where the earth had been crumbled by the floods it showed a steep brown cut denuding a mass of roots intertwined as if wrestling underground and in the air the interlaced boughs bound and loaded with creepers carried on the struggle for life mingled their foliage in one solid wall of leaves with here and there the shape of an enormous dark pillar soaring or a ragged opening as if torn by the flight of a cannon ball disclosing the impenetrable gloom within the secular inviolable shade of the virgin forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thump of the engines reverberated regularly like the strokes of a metronome beating the measure of the vast silence the shadow of the western wall had fallen across the river and the smoke pouring backwards from the funnel eddied down behind the ship spread a thin dusky veil over the somber water which checked by the floodtide seemed to lie stagnant in the whole straight length of the reaches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sternes body as if rooted on the spot trembled slightly from top to toe with the internal vibration of the ship from under his feet came sometimes a sudden clang of iron the noisy burst of a shout below to the right the leaves of the treetops caught the rays of the low sun and seemed to shine with a golden green light of their own shimmering around the highest boughs which stood out black against a smooth blue sky that seemed to droop over the bed of the river like the roof of a tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passengers for batu beru kneeling on the planks were engaged in rolling their bedding of mats busily they tied up bundles they snapped the locks of wooden chests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pockmarked peddler of small wares threw his head back to drain into his throat the last drops out of an earthenware bottle before putting it away in a roll of blankets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knots of traveling traders standing about the deck conversed in low tones the followers of a small rajah from down the coast broadfaced simple young fellows in white drawers and round white cotton caps with their colored sarongs twisted across their bronze shoulders squatted on their hams on the hatch chewing betel with bright red mouths as if they had been tasting blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their spears lying piled up together within the circle of their bare toes resembled a casual bundle of dry bamboos a thin livid chinaman with a bulky package wrapped up in leaves already thrust under his arm gazed ahead eagerly a wandering kling rubbed his teeth with a bit of wood pouring over the side a bright stream of water out of his lips the fat rajah dozed in a shabby deckchairand at the turn of every bend the two walls of leaves reappeared running parallel along the banks with their impenetrable solidity fading at the top to a vaporous mistiness of countless slender twigs growing free of young delicate branches shooting from the topmost limbs of hoary trunks of feathery heads of climbers like delicate silver sprays standing up without a quiver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not a sign of a clearing anywhere not a trace of human habita tion except when in one place on the bare end of a low point under an isolated group of slender treeferns the jagged tangled remnants of an old hut on piles ap peared with that peculiar aspect of ruined bamboo walls that look as if smashed with a club <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farther on half hidden under the drooping bushes a canoe containing a man and a woman together with a dozen green cocoa nuts in a heap rocked helplessly after the sofala had passed like a navigating contrivance of venturesome insects of traveling ants while two glassy folds of water streaming away from each bow of the steamer across the whole width of the river ran with her up stream smoothly fretting their outer ends into a brown whispering tumble of froth against the miry foot of each bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must thought sterne bring that brute massy to his bearings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its getting too absurd in the end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres the old man up there buried in his chairhe may just as well be in his grave for all the use hell ever be in the worldand the serangs in charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the place thats mine by rights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must bring that savage brute to his bear ings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill do it at once too  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the mate made an abrupt start a little brown halfnaked boy with large black eyes and the string of a written charm round his neck became panicstruck at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dropped the banana he had been munch ing and ran to the knee of a grave dark arab in flow ing robes sitting like a biblical figure incongruously on a yellow tin trunk corded with a rope of twisted rattan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the father unmoved put out his hand to pat the little shaven poll protectingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne crossed the deck upon the track of the chief engineer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack the second retreating backwards down the engineroom ladder and still wiping his hands treated him to an incomprehensible grin of white teeth out of his grimy hard face massy was nowhere to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must have gone straight into his berth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne scratched at the door softly then putting his i must speak to you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just give me a minute or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take yourself off alto getherto the other end of the shipquite away  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when do you think you will be at liberty sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answer to this was an exasperated never and at once sterne with a very firm expression of face turned the handle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massys staterooma narrow oneberth cabin smelt strongly of soap and presented to view a swept dusted unadorned neatness not so much bare as barren not so much severe as starved and lacking in humanity like the ward of a public hospital or rather owing to the small size like the clean retreat of a desperately poor but exemplary person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a single photograph frame ornamented the bulkheads not a single article of clothing not as much as a spare cap hung from the brass hooks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the inside was painted in one plain tint of pale blue two big seachests in sailcloth covers and with iron padlocks fitted exactly in the space under the bunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one glance was enough to embrace all the strip of scrubbed planks within the four unconcealed corners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the absence of the usual settee was striking the teakwood top of the washingstand seemed hermeti cally closed and so was the lid of the writingdesk which protruded from the partition at the foot of the bedplace containing a mattress as thin as a pancake under a threadbare blanket with a faded red stripe and a folded mosquitonet against the nights spent in harbor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not a scrap of paper anywhere in sight no boots on the floor no litter of any sort not a speck of dust anywhere no traces of pipeash even which in a heavy smoker was morally revolting like a manifesta tion of extreme hypocrisy and the bottom of the old wooden armchair the only seat there polished with much use shone as if its shabbiness had been waxed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the screen of leaves on the bank passing as if unrolled endlessly in the round opening of the port sent a waver ing network of light and shade into the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne holding the door open with one hand had thrust in his head and shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this amazing intrusion massy who was doing absolutely nothing jumped up speechless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont call names murmured sterne hurriedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think of nothing but your good mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pause as of extreme astonishment followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they both seemed to have lost their tongues <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the mate went on with a discreet glibness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you simply couldnt conceive whats going on on board your ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wouldnt enter your head for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are too goodtootoo upright mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy to suspect anybody of such a  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its enough to make your hair stand on end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he watched for the effect massy seemed dazed un comprehending <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he only passed the palm of his hand on the coalblack wisps plastered across the top of his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a tone suddenly changed to confidential au dacity sterne hastened on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember that theres only six weeks left to run  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other was looking at him stonily  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so anyhow you shall require a captain for the ship before long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then only as if that suggestion had scarified his flesh in the manner of redhot iron massy gave a start and seemed ready to shriek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he contained himself by a great effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> require a captain he repeated with scathing slow ness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dare to tell me that i need any of you humbugging sailors to run my ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and your likes have been fattening on me for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have hurt me less to throw my money overboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old ship knows as much as the best of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he snapped his teeth audibly and growled through them the silly law requires a captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne had taken heart of grace meantime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the silly insurance people too as well he said lightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i want to ask is why shouldnt i do sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont say but you could take a steamer about the world as well as any of us sailors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont pretend to tell you that it is a very great trick  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he emitted a short hollow guffaw familiarly  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt make the lawbut there it is and i am an active young fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i quite hold with your ideas i know your ways by this time mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt try to give myself airs like thatthater lazy specimen of an old man up there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put a marked emphasis on the last sentence to lead massy away from the track in case  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he did not doubt of now holding his success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chief engineer seemed nonplused like a slow man invited to catch hold of a whirligig of some sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what you want sir is a chap with no nonsense about him who would be content to be your sailingmaster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i am fit for the work as much as that serang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because thats what it amounts to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know sir that a dam malay like a monkey is in charge of your shipand no one else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just listen to his feet pitpatting above us on the bridgereal officer in charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes taking her up the river while the great man is wallowing in the chairperhaps asleep and if he is that would not make it much worse either take my word for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to thrust himself farther in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy with lowered forehead one hand grasping the back of the armchair did not budge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think sir that the man has got you tight in his agreement  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy raised a heavy snarling face at this  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir one cant help hearing of it on board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it has been the talk on shore for years fellows have been making bets about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its you who have got him at your mercy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will say that you cant dismiss him for indolence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> difficult to prove in court and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you say the word sir i can tell you some thing about his indolence that will give you the clear right to fire him out on the spot and put me in charge for the rest of this very tripyes sir before we leave batu beruand make him pay a dollar a day for his keep till we get back if you like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now what do you think of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its really well worth your while and i am quite ready to take your bare word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a definite statement from you would be as good as a bond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a simple state mentand he thought to himself that he would man age somehow to stick in his berth as long as it suited him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would make himself indispensable the ship had a bad name in her port it would be easy to scare the fellows off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy would have to keep him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a definite statement from me would be enough massy repeated slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne stuck out his chin cheerily and blinked at close quarters with that uncon scious impudence which had the power to enrage massy beyond anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> listen well to me then mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne i wouldnt dye hear?i wouldnt promise you the value of two pence for anything you can tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he struck sternes arm away with a smart blow and catching hold of the handle pulled the door to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the terrific slam darkened the cabin instantaneously to his eye as if after the flash of an explosion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once he dropped into the chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ship had in that place to shave the bank so close that the gigantic wall of leaves came gliding like a shutter against the port the darkness of the primeval forest seemed to flow into that bare cabin with the odor of rotting leaves of sodden soilthe strong muddy smell of the living earth steaming uncovered after the pass ing of a deluge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bushes swished loudly alongside above there was a series of crackling sounds with a sharp rain of small broken branches falling on the bridge a creeper with a great rustle snapped on the head of a boat davit and a long luxuriant green twig actually whipped in and out of the open port leaving behind a few torn leaves that remained suddenly at rest on mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the ship sheering out in the stream the light began to return but did not augment beyond a subdued clearness for the sun was very low already and the river wending its sinuous course through a multitude of secular trees as if at the bottom of a precipitous gorge had been already in vaded by a deepening gloomthe swift precursor of the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his lips trembled almost imperceptibly his hands too a little and to calm himself he opened the writingdesk spread out a sheet of thin grayish paper covered with a mass of printed figures and began to scan them at tentively for the twentieth time this trip at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with his elbows propped his head between his hands he seemed to lose himself in the study of an abstruse problem in mathematics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the list of the winning numbers from the last drawing of the great lottery which had been the one inspiring fact of so many years of his existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conception of a life deprived of that periodical sheet of paper had slipped away from him entirely as another man according to his nature would not have been able to conceive a world without fresh air without activity or without affection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great pile of flimsy sheets had been growing for years in his desk while the sofala driven by the faithful jack wore out her boilers in tramping up and down the straits from cape to cape from river to river from bay to bay accumulating by that hard labor of an overworked starved ship the blackened mass of these documents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy kept them under lock and key like a treasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was in them as in the experience of life the fascination of hope the excitement of a half penetrated mystery the longing of a halfsatisfied desire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for days together on a trip he would shut himself up in his berth with them the thump of the toiling engines pulsated in his ear and he would weary his brain poring over the rows of disconnected figures be wildering by their senseless sequence resembling the hazards of destiny itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he nourished a conviction that there must be some logic lurking somewhere in the results of chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought he had seen its very form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his head swam his limbs ached he puffed at his pipe mechanically a contemplative stupor would soothe the fretfulness of his temper like the passive bodily quietude procured by a drug while the intellect remains tensely on the stretch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next winning number of the great prize was fortyseven thousand and five <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these numbers of course would have to be avoided in the future when writing to manilla for the tickets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he mumbled pencil in hand  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wetted his finger the papers rustled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three years ago in the september drawing it was number nine aught four two that took the first prize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a hint there of a definite rule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was afraid of missing some recondite principle in the overwhelming wealth of his material <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for half an hour he would remain dead still bent low over the desk without twitching a muscle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at his back the whole berth would be thick with a heavy body of smoke as if a bomb had burst in there unnoticed unheard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he would lock up the desk with the decision of unshaken confidence jump and go out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would walk swiftly back and forth on that part of the foredeck which was kept clear of the lumber and of the bodies of the native passengers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were a great nuisance but they were also a source of profit that could not be dis dained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he needed every penny of profit the sofala could make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little enough it was in all conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the incertitude of chance gave him no concern since he had somehow arrived at the conviction that in the course of years every number was bound to have his winning turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was simply a matter of time and of taking as many tickets as he could afford for every drawing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he generally took rather more all the earn ings of the ship went that way and also the wages he allowed himself as chief engineer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the wages he paid to others that he begrudged with a reasoned and at the same time a passionate regret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he scowled at the lascars with their deck brooms at the quarter masters rubbing the brass rails with greasy rags he was eager to shake his fist and roar abuse in bad malay at the poor carpentera timid sickly opiumfuddled chinaman in loose blue drawers for all costume who invariably dropped his tools and fled below with stream ing tail and shaking all over before the fury of that devil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was when he raised up his eyes to the bridge where one of these sailor frauds was always planted by law in charge of his ship that he felt almost dizzy with rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he abominated them all it was an old feud from the time he first went to sea an un licked cub with a great opinion of himself in the engineroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slights that had been put upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the persecutions he had suffered at the hands of skip persof absolute nobodies in a steamship after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now that he had risen to be a shipowner they were still a plague to him he had absolutely to pay away precious money to the conceited useless loafersas if a fully qualified engineerwho was the owner as well were not fit to be trusted with the whole charge of a ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made it pretty warm for them but it was a poor consolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had come in time to hate the ship too for the repairs she required for the coal bills he had to pay for the poor beggarly freights she earned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would clench his hand as he walked and hit the rail a sudden blow viciously as though she could be made to feel pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet he could not do without er he needed her he must hang on to her tooth and nail to keep his head above water till the expected flood of fortune came sweeping up and landed him safely on the high shore of his ambition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was now to do nothing nothing whatever and have plenty of money to do it on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had tasted of power the highest form of it his limited experience was aware ofthe power of shipowning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had thrown away the substance for the shadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the gratification of wealth he did not know enough to excite his imagination with any visions of luxury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could hethe child of a drunken boilermakergoing straight from the workshop into the engineroom of a northcountry collier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the notion of the absolute idleness of wealth he could very well conceive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reveled in it to forget his present troubles he imagined himself walking about the streets of hull he knew their gutters well as a boy with his pockets full of sov ereigns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would buy himself a house his married sisters their husbands his old workshop chums would render him infinite homage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there would be nothing to think of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been out of work for a long time before he won his prize and he remembered how carlo mariani commonly known as paunchy charley the maltese hotelkeeper at the slummy end of denham street had cringed joyfully before him in the evening when the news had come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor charley though he made his living by ministering to various abject vices gave credit for their food to many a piece of white wreckage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was naively over joyed at the idea of his old bills being paid and he reckoned confidently on a spell of festivities in the cavernous grogshop downstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy remembered the curious respectful looks of the trashy white men in the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his heart had swelled within him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy had left charleys infamous den directly he had realized the possibilities open to him and with his nose in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwards the memory of these adulations was a great sadness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the true power of moneyand no trouble with it nor any thinking required either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought with difficulty and felt vividly to his blunt brain the problems offered by any ordered scheme of life seemed in their cruel toughness to have been put in his way by the obvious malevolence of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a shipowner everyone had conspired to make him a nobody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could he have been such a fool as to purchase that ac cursed ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been abominably swindled there was no end to this swindling and as the difficulties of his improvident ambition gathered thicker round him he really came to hate everybody he had ever come in con tact with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a temper naturally irritable and an amazing sensitiveness to the claims of his own personality had ended by making of life for him a sort of infernoa place where his lost soul had been given up to the tor ment of savage brooding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had never hated anyone so much as that old man who had turned up one evening to save him from an utter disasterfrom the conspiracy of the wretched sailors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to have fallen on board from the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his footsteps echoed on the empty steamer and the strange deeptoned voice on deck repeating inter rogatively the words mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had been startling like a wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and coming up from the depths of the cold engineroom where he had been pottering dismally with a candle amongst the enormous shadows thrown on all sides by the skeleton limbs of ma chinery massy had been struck dumb by astonishment in the presence of that imposing old man with a beard like a silver plate towering in the dusk rendered lurid by the expiring flames of sunset <end> <end> 
<start> <start> want to see me on business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you see that this ship is laid up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy had turned at bay before the pursuing irony of his disaster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwards he could not believe his ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was that old fellow getting at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would presently wake up and find the man vanished like a shape of mist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gravity the dignity the firm and courteous tone of that athletic old stranger impressed massy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five hundred pounds are no dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it was an offer to catch hold of for dear life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what could there be behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before they had parted after appointing a meeting in a solicitors office early on the morrow massy was asking himself what is his motive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spent the night in hammering out the clauses of the agreementa unique instrument of its sort whose tenor got bruited abroad somehow and became the talk and wonder of the port <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massys object had been to secure for himself as many ways as possible of getting rid of his partner without being called upon at once to pay back his share <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cap tain whalleys efforts were directed to making the money secure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it not ivys moneya part of her fortune whose only other asset was the timedefying body of her old father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure of his forbearance in the strength of his love for her he accepted with stately serenity massys stupidly cunning paragraphs against his in competence his dishonesty his drunkenness for the sake of other stringent stipulations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of three years he was at liberty to withdraw from the partner ship taking his money with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> provision was made for forming a fund to pay him off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if he left the sofala before the term from whatever cause barring death massy was to have a whole year for paying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lawyer had suggested a young man fresh from europe and not overburdened with business who was rather amused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy began to whine unctu ously how could he be expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let that go captain whalley had said with a superb confidence in his body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the midst of life we are in death but he trusted his maker with a still greater fearlessnesshis maker who knew his thoughts his human affections and his motives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his creator knew what use he was making of his healthhow much he wanted it  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i trust my first illness will be my last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never been ill that i can remember he had remarked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at this early stage he had already awakened massys hostility by refusing to make it six hundred instead of five <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot do that was all he had said simply but with so much decision that massy desisted at once from pressing the point but had thought to himself cant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must have lots of money but he would like to get hold of a soft berth and the sixth part of my profits for nothing if he only could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and during these years massys dislike grew under the restraint of something resembling fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the simplicity of that man appeared dangerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of late he had changed however had appeared less formidable and with a lessened vigor of life as though he had received a secret wound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still he remained incomprehensible in his simplicity fearlessness and rectitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when massy learned that he meant to leave him at the end of the time to leave him confronted with the problem of boilers his dislike blazed up secretly into hate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had made him so cleareyed that for a long time now mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne could have told him nothing he did not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had much ado in trying to terrorize that mean sneak into silence he wanted to deal alone with the situation andincredible as it might have ap peared to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sternehe had not yet given up the de sire and the hope of inducing that hated old man to stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing else to do unless he were to abandon his chances of fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now suddenly since the crossing of the bar at batu beru things seemed to be coming rapidly to a point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it disquieted him so much that the study of the winning numbers failed to soothe his agitation and the twilight in the cabin deepened very somber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put the list away muttering once more oh no my boy you dont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not mean the blinking eavesdropping humbug to force his action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took his head again into his hands his im mobility confined in the darkness of this shutup little place seemed to make him a thing apart infinitely re moved from the stir and the sounds of the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard them the passengers were beginning to jabber excitedly somebody dragged a heavy box past his door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard captain whalleys voice stations mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the answer from some ay ay sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall moor head up stream this time the ebb has made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will see to it mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answer was covered by the autocratic clang on the engineroom gong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the propeller went on beating slowly one two three one two threewith pauses as if hesitating on the turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gong clanged time after time and the water churned this way and that by the blades was making a great noisy commotion alongside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a shorelight on the other bank a quarter of a mile across the river drifted no bigger than a tiny star passing slowly athwart the cir cle of the port <end> <end> 
<start> <start> van wyks jetty an swered the hails from the ship ropes were thrown and missed and thrown again the swaying flame of a torch carried in a large sampan coming to fetch away in state the rajah from down the coast cast a sudden ruddy glare into his cabin over his very person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a few last ponderous turns the engines stopped and the prolonged clanging of the gong signified that the captain had done with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great number of boats and canoes of all sizes boarded the offside of the sofala <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then after a time the tumult of splashing of cries of shuffling feet of packages dropped with a thump the noise of the native passen gers going away subsided slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the shore a voice cultivated slightly authoritative spoke very brought any mail for me this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the two zeros that is the simple and compound stand apart and may be separately staked upon should either turn up the stake is increased in a far larger proportion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to render the game equal without counting in the zeros and other trifles the winner ought to receive the square of instead of  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a melancholy amusement to any rational being not infatuated by the blind rage of gold to witness the incredible excitement so repeatedly made to take the bank by storm sometimes by surprise anon by stealth and not rarely by digging a mine laying intrenchments and opening a fire of field pieces heavy ordnance and flying artillery but the fortress proud and conscious of its superior strength built on a rock of adamant laughs at the fiery attacks of its foes nay itself invites the storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for those classes of mankind who possess a little more prudence the game called trenteetun and quarante or rouge et noir are substituted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lord of the temple or establishment pays i believe to government a yearly sum of florins about l for permission to keep up the establishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has gone to immense expense in decorating the building he pays a crowd of croupiers at different salaries and officers of his own who superintend and direct matters he lights up the building and he presides over the festivities of the townin short he is the patron of it all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with all this liberality he himself derives an enormous revenue an income as sure and determined as that of my lord city of the fountains or badenbaden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baden season begins in may the official opening takes place towards the close of the spring quarter and then the fashionable world begins to arrive at the rendezvous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it cannot be denied that everything is right well regulated and apart from the terrible dangers of gambling the place does very great credit to the authorities who thrive on the nefarious traffic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perfect order and decency of deportment with all the necessary civilities of life are rigorously insisted on and summary expulsion is the consequence of any intolerable conduct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it so happens that any person becomes obnoxious in any way whatever may be his or her rank the first intimation will be sir you are not in your place here or madame the air of baden does not suit you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if these words are disregarded there follows a summary orderyou must leave baden this very day and mr sala in his novel make your game has given a spirited description of the gambling scenes at baden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whilst i write there is exhibited at the egyptian hall london dores magnificent picture of the tapis vert or life in the tapis vert is a moral and at the same time an exceedingly clever satire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is illustrative of the life manners and predilections and pursuits of a class of society left hereafter to enjoy the manifold attractions of fashionable wateringplaces without the scourge that for so many years held its immoral and degrading sway in their sumptuous halls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one of these splendid salons the fashionable crowd is eagerly pressing round an oblong table covered with green cloth le tapis vert upon which piles of gold and banknotes tell the tale of noir perd et la couleur gagne and vice versa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the principal group upon which dore has thrown one of his powerful effects of light is lifelike and several of the actors are at once recognized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is much life and movement in the silent scene in which thousands of pounds change hands in a few seconds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the left of the croupier dealer who turns up the winning card sits a finelydressed woman who cares for little else but gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a remarkable expression of eagerness and curiosity upon the countenance of the lady who comes next and who endeavours with the assistance of her eyeglass to find out the state of affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gentleman next to her is an inveterate blase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countenance of the old man reckoning up needs no description <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near by stands a lady with a red feather in her hat and whose lace shawl alone is worth several hundred pounds for dore made it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two female figures to the left are splendidly painted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the one who causes the other croupier to turn round seems somewhat extravagantly dressed but these costumes have been frequently worn within the last two years both at baden and hombourg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady at the end of the table to the left is a wellknown habituee at both places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bustling and shuffling eagerness of the figures in the background is exceedingly well rendered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a whole the tapis vert is a very fine illustration of real life as met with in most of the leading german watering at the present moment says another authority writing more than a year ago there are three very bold female gamblers at baden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one is the russian princess who plays several hours every day at rouge et noir and sometimes makes what in our money would be many hundreds and at others goes empty away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wins calmly enough but when luck is against her looks anxious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second is the wife of an italian exminister who is well known both as an authoress and politician <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she patronizes roulette and at every turn of the wheel her money passes on the board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is a good gamblersmirking when she wins and smirking when she loses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dresses as splendidly as any of the dames of paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other night she excited a flutter among the ladies assembled in the salons of the conversation by appearing in a robe flaming red with an exaggerated train which dragged its slow length along the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the greatest of the feminine players is the leonie leblanc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she is at the rouge et noir table a larger crowd than usual is collected to witness her operation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stake she generally risks is francs l which is the maximum allowed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her chance is changing a few days back she won l in one sitting some days later she lost about l and was then reduced to the for her indignity of playing for paltry sumsl or among the more recent chronicles the figaro gives the following account of the close of the campaign of a gaming hero m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> edgar de la charme who for a number of days together never left the gamingroom without carrying off the sum of francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de la charme reflecting that there must be an end even to the greatest run of luck locked his portmanteau paid his bill and took the road to the railway station accompanied by some of his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on reaching the wicket he found it closed there were still threequarters of an hour to pass before the departure of the train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will go and play my parting game he exclaimed and turning to the coachman bade him drive to the kursaal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his friends surrounded him and held him back he should not go he would lose all his winnings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was resolute and soon reached the casino where his travelling dress caused a stir of satisfaction among the croupiers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat down at the trenteetquarante broke the bank in minutes got into his cab again and seeing the inspector of the tables walking to and fro under the arcades he said to him in a tone of exquisite politeness i could not spa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gambling houses of spa are in the redoute where rouge et noir and roulette are carried on nearly from morning to night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the profits of these establishments exceed l a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in former times they belonged to the bishop of liege who was a partner in the concern and derived a considerable revenue from his share of the illgotten gains of the manager of the establishment and no gambling tables could be set up without his murrays handbook for travellers on the continent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gambling in spa is in a lower style than elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the croupiers seem to be always on the lookout for cheating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you never see here a pile of gold or bank notes on the table as at hombourg or wiesbaden with the player saying cinquante louis aux billet centvingt louis a la masse and the winnings scrupulously paid or the losings raked carefully away from the heap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they do not allow that at spa there is an order against it on the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not trust the people that play i suppose and it is doubtful if the people could trust the croupiers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ball spins more slowly at roulettethe cards are dealt more gingerly at trenteetquarante here than elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing must be done quickly lest somebody on one side or other should try to do somebody else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> altogether spa is not a pleasant place to play in and as moreover the odds are as great against you as at ems it is better to stick to the promenade de sept heures and the ballroom and leave the two tables alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> outside it is cheery and full of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queen of the belgians is here the duke of aumale and other nice people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the breeze from the hills is always delicious the promenade meyerbeer as refreshing on a hot day as a draught of iced water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the denizens male and female of the salons de jeu are often obnoxious and one wishes that the old baden law could be enforced against some of the gentler sex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by way of warning to any of your readers who propose to visit the tables this summer will you let me tell a little anecdote from personal experience of one of these placeswhich one i had perhaps better not say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took a place at the roulette table and had not staked more than once or twice when two handsomely dressed ladies placed themselves one on either side of me and commenced playing with the smallest coins allowed wedging me in rather unpleasantly close between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at my third or fourth stake i won on both the colour and a number and my neighbour on the right quietly swept up my coins from the colour the instant they were paid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remonstrated and she very politely argued the point ending by restoring my money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but during our discussion my far larger stake paid in the mean while on the winning number had disappeared into the pocket of my neighbour on the left who was not so polite and was very indignant at my suggestion that the stake was mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an appeal to the croupier only produced a shrug of the shoulders and regret that he had not seen who staked the money an offer to stop the play and a suggestion that i should find it very difficult to prove it was my stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plant between the two women was evident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole thing was a systematicallyplanned robbery and very possibly the croupier was a confederate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i detected the two women in communication and i told them that i should change my place to the other side of the table where i would trouble them not to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they took the hint very mildly and could afford to do so for they had got my money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the affair was very neatly managed and would succeed in nearly every case especially if the croupier is as is most probable always on the hombourg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in hombourg was an obscure village consisting of the castle of the landgraf and of a few hundred houses which in the course of ages had clustered around it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> few would have known of its existence except from the fact of its being the capital of the smallest of european countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its inhabitants lived poor and contentedthe world forgetting by the world forgot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it boasted only of one innthe aiglewhich in summer was frequented by a few german families who came to live cheaply and to drink the waters of a neighbouring mineral spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that same year two french brothers of the name of blanc arrived at frankfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were men of a speculative turn and a recent and somewhat daring speculation in france connected with the old semaphore telegraph had rendered it necessary for them to withdraw for a time from their native land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their stockintrade consisted in a roulette wheel a few thousand francs and an old and skilful croupier of frascati who knew a great deal about the properties of cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the authorities of the town of frankfort being dull traders declined to allow them to initiate their townsmen into the mysteries of cards and roulette so hearing that there were some strangers living at hombourg they put themselves into an old diligence and the same evening disembarked at the aigle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day the elder brother called upon the prime minister an ancient gentleman who with a couple of clerks for some l a year governed the landgrafate of hombourg to his own and the general satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a private interview with this statesman the elder blanc returned poorer in money but with a permission in his pocket to put up his roulette wheel in one of the rooms of the inn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few months the money of the innocent waterdrinkers passed from their pockets into those of the brothers blanc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ancient man of frascati turned the wheel and no matter on what number the waterdrinkers risked their money that number did not turn up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the close of the summer season a second visit was made to the prime minister and the blancs returned to frankfort with an exclusive concession to establish games of hazard within the wide spreading dominions of the landgraf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this they had agreed to build a kursaal to lay out a public garden and to pay into the national exchequer florins a florin is worth one shilling and eightpence per annum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having obtained this concession the next step was to found a company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frankfort abounds in hebrew speculators who are not particular how they make money and as the speculation appeared a good one the money was soon forthcoming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was decided that the nominal capital was to be florins divided into shares of florins each <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half the shares were subscribed for by the hebrew financialists and the other half was credited to the blancs as the price of their concession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the winter a small kursaal was built and a small garden planted the mineral well was deepened and flaming advertisements appeared in all the german newspapers announcing to the world that the famous waters of hombourg were able to cure every disease to which flesh is heir and that to enable visitors to while away their evenings agreeably a salon had been opened in which they would have an opportunity to win fabulous sums by risking their money either at the game of trente et quarante or at roulette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from these small beginnings arose the company whose career has been so notorious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has enjoyed uninterrupted good fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the twentysix years that have elapsed since its foundation a vast palace dedicated to gambling has been built the village has become a town well paved and lighted with gas the neighbouring hills are covered with villas about eighty acres have been laid out in pleasure grounds roads have been made in all directions through the surrounding woods the visitors are numbered by tens of thousands there are above twenty hotels and many hundred let those who are disposed to risk their money inquire what is the character of the managers and be on their guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the expenses of such an enormous and splendid establishment amount to l and the shares have for some years paid a handsome dividendthe whole of which must be paid out of the pockets of murray ubi supra <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mr sala in his interesting work already quoted furnishes the completest account of hombourg its kursaal and gambling in hombourg the kursaal is everything and the town nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the extortionate hotelkeepers the snubnosed rogues of counter and till who overcharge you in the shops make their egregious profits from the kursaal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the major part of the landgraves revenue is derived from the kursaal he draws l a year from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and his house are sold to the kursaal and the board of directors of the kursaal are the real sovereigns and landgraves of hesse hombourg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have metamorphosed a miserable midgerman townlet into a city of palaces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their stuccoed and frescoed palace is five hundred times handsomer than the mouldy old schloss built by william with the silver leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have planted the gardens they have imported the orangetrees they have laid out the park and enclosed the huntinggrounds they board lodge wash and tax the inhabitants and i may say without the slightest attempt at punning that the citizens are all kursed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the kursaal is the ball or concertroom at either end of which is a gallery supported by pillars of composition marble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the floors are inlaid and immense mirrors in sumptuous frames hang on the walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vice can see her own image all over the establishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ceiling is superbly decorated with bas reliefs in cartonpierre like those in mr barrys new covent garden theatre and fresco paintings executed by viotti of milan and conti of munich whilst the whole is lighted up by enormous and gorgeous chandeliers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the apartment to the right is called the salle japanese and is used as a diningroom for a monster table dhote held twice a day and served by the famous chevet of paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a huge cafe olympique for smoking and imbibing purposes private cabinets for parties the monster saloon and two smaller ones where from eleven in the forenoon to eleven at night sundays not excepted all the year round and year after yearthe administration have yet a jouissance of eightyfive years to run out guaranteed by the incoming dynasty of hesse darmstadt knaves and fools from almost every corner of the world gamble at the ingenious and amusing games of roulette and rouge et noir otherwise trente et quarante <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is one table covered with green baize tightly stretched as on a billiardfield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the midst of the table there is a circular pit coved inwards but not bottomless and containing the roulette wheel a revolving disc turning with an accurate momentum on a brass pillar and divided at its outer edge into thirtyseven narrow and shallow pigeonhole compartments coloured alternately red and black and numbered not consecutivelyup to thirtysix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last is a blank and stands for zero number nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> round the upper edge too run a series of little brass hoops or bridges to cause the ball to hop and skip and not at once into the nearest compartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the regimen of roulette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the banker sits before the wheela croupier or payerout of winnings to and raker in of losses from the players on either side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crying in a voice calmly sonorous faites le jeu messieursmake your game gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the banker gives the wheel a dexterous twirl and ere it has made one revolution casts into its maelstrom of black and red an ivory ball <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the interval between this and the ball finding a home is one of breathless anxiety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stakes are eagerly laid but at a certain period of the revolution the banker calls outle jeu est fait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rien ne va plus and after that intimation it is useless to lay down money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the banker in the same calm and impassable voice declares the result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may run thusvingtneuf noir impair et passe twentynine black odd and pass the rubicon no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or huit rouge pair et manque eight red even and not pass the rubicon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now on either side of the wheel and extending to the extremity of the table run in duplicate the schedule of mises or stakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the green baize first offers just thirtysix square compartments marked out by yellow threads woven in the fabric itself and bearing thirtysix consecutive numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you place a florin one and eightpenceand no lower stake is permitted or ten florins or a napoleon or an english fivepound note or any sum of money not exceeding the maximum whose multiple is the highest stake which the bank if it loses can be made to pay in the midst of compartment and if the banker in that calm voice of his has declared that has become the resting place of the ball the croupier will push towards you with his rake exactly thirtythree times the amount of your stake whatever it might have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must bear in mind however that the banks loss on a single stake is limited to eight thousand francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover if you have placed another sum of money in the compartment inscribed in legible yellow colours impair or odd you will receive the equivalent to your staketwenty nine being an odd number <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you have placed a coin on passe you will also receive this additional equivalent to your stake twentynine being past the rubicon or middle of the table of numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again if you have ventured your money in a compartment bearing for device a lozenge in outline which represents black and twentynine being a black number you will again pocket a double stake that is one in addition to your original venture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more and more stillif you have risked money on the columnsthat is betted on the number turning up corresponding with some number in one of the columns of the tabular schedule and have selected the right columnyou have your own stake and two othersif you have betted on either of these three eventualities douze premier douze milieu or douze dernier otherwise first dozen middle dozen or last dozen as one to twelve thirteen to twentyfour twentyfive to thirtysix all inclusive and have chanced to select douze dernier the division in which no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> occurs you also obtain a treble stake namely your own and two more which the bank pays you your florin or your fivepound note benign fact!metamorphosed into three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but woe to the wight who should have ventured on the number eight on the red colour compartment with a crimson lozenge on even and on not past the rubicon for twentynine does not comply with any one of these conditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he loses and his money is coolly swept away from him by the croupiers rake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with reference to the last chances i enumerated in the last paragraph i should mention that the number eight would lie in the second column there being three columnsand in the first dozen numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are more chances or rather subdivisions of chances to entice the player to back the numbers for these the stations of the ball are as capricious as womankind and it is of course extremely rare that a player will fix upon the particular number that happens to turn up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he may place a piece of money a cheval or astride on the line which divides two numbers in which case either of the numbers turning up he receives sixteen times his stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may place it on the cross lines that divide four numbers and if either of the four wins he will receive eight times the amount of his stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> zero is designated by the compartment close to the wheels diameter and zero or blank will turn up on an average about once in seventy times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you have placed money in zero and the ball seeks that haven you will receive thirty the twin or elder brother of roulette played at hombourg rouge et noir or trente et quarante is thus described by mr there is the ordinary greencloth covered table with its brilliant downcoming lights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the centre sits the banker gold and silver in piles and rouleaux and banknotes before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on either hand the croupier as before now wielding the rakes and plying them to bring in the money now balancing them now shouldering them as soldiers do their muskets halfpay officers their canes and dandies their silk umbrellas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bankers cards are as throughout all the rhenish gamingplaces of french design the same that were invented or at least first used in europe for crazy charles the simple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these cards are placed on an inclined plane of marble called a talon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dealer first takes six packs of cards shuffles them and distributes them in various parcels to the various punters or players round the table to shuffle and mix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then finally shuffles them and takes and places the end cards into various parts of the three hundred and twelve cards until he meets with a court card which he must place upright at the end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this done he presents the pack to one of the players to cut who places the pictured card where the dealer separates the pack and that part of the pack beyond the pictured card he places at the end nearest him leaving the pictured card at the bottom of the pack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dealer then takes a certain number of cards about as many as would form a pack and looking at the first card to know its colour puts it on the table with its face downwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then takes two cards one red and the other black and sets them back to back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these cards are turned and displayed conspicuously as often as the colour varies for the information of the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gamblers having staked their money on either of the colours the dealer asks votre jeu estil fait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or le jeu est pret messieurs the game is ready gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then deals the first card with its face upwards saying noir and continues dealing until the cards turned exceed thirty points or pips in number which number he must mention as trenteetun or trentesix as the case may be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the aces reckon but for one no card after thirty can make up forty the dealer therefore does not declare the tens after thirtyone or upwards but merely the units as one two three if the number of points dealt for noir are thirtyfive he says cinq <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another parcel is then dealt for rouge or red and with equal deliberation and solemnity and if the players stake beyond the colour that comes to thirtyone or nearest to it he wins which happy eventuality is announced by the dealer crying rouge gagne red wins or rouge perd red loses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these two parcels one for each colour make a coup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same number of parcels being dealt for each colour the dealer says apres after <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a doublet called in the amiable french tongue un refait by which neither party wins unless both colours come to thirty one which the dealer announces by saying un refait trente etun and he wins half the stakes posted on both colours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he however does not take the money but removes it to the middle line and the players may change the venue of their stakes if they please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is called the first prison or la premiere prison and if they win their next event they draw the entire stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in case of another refait the money is removed into the third line which is called the second prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you see that there are wheels within wheels and lord chancellor kings dictum that walls can be built higher but there should be no prison within a prison is sometimes reversed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when this happens the dealer wins all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cards are sometimes cut for which colour shall be dealt first but in general the first parcel is for black and the second for red <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the odds against a refait turning up are usually reckoned as to  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bankers however acknowledge that they expect it twice in three deals and there are generally from twentynine to thirtytwo coups in each deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the odds in favour of winning several times are about the same as in the game of pharaon and are as delusive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he who goes to hombourg and expects to see any melodramatic manifestation of rage disappointment and despair in the losing players reckons without his host <end> <end> 
<start> <start> winners or losers seldom speak above a whisper and the only sound that is heard above the suppressed buzz of conversation the muffled jingle of the money on the green cloth the sweep of the croupiers rakes and the ticking of the very ornate french clocks on the mantelpieces is the impassibly metallic voice of the banker as he proclaims his rouge perd or couleur gagne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people are too genteel at hombourgvonderhohe to scream to yell to fall into fainting fits or go into convulsions because they have lost four or five thousand francs or so in a single coup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard of one gentleman indeed who after a ruinous loss put a pistol to his head and discharging it spattered his brains over the roulette wheel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was said that the banker looking up calmly called outtriple zero treble nothinga case as yet unheard of in the tactics of roulette but signifying annihilationand that a cloth being thrown over the ensanguined wheel the bank of that particular table was declared to be closed for the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very probably the whole story is but a newspaper canard devised by the proprietors of some rival gaming establishment who would have been delighted to see the fashionable hombourg under a cloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when people want to commit suicide at hombourg they do it genteelly early in the morning or late at night in the solitude of their own apartments at the hotels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be reckoned a gross breach of good manners to scandalize the refined and liberal administration of the kursaal by undisguised felo dese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the devil on two croupes at hombourg is the very genteelest of demons imaginable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ties his tail up with cherrycoloured ribbon and conceals his cloven foot in a patent leather boot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this gentility and varnish and elegant veneering of the sulphurous pit takes away from him if it does not wholly extinguish the honour and loathing for a common gaminghouse with which the mind of a wellured english youth has been sedulously imbued by his parents and guardians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has very probably witnessed the performance of the gamester at the theatre and been a spectator of the remorseful agonies of mr beverly the virtuous sorrows of mrs b <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the dark villanies of messieurs dawson and bates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first visit of the british youth to the kursaal is usually paid with fear and trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is with difficulty persuaded to enter the accursed place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when introduced to the saloons delusively called de conversation he begins by staring fixedly at the chandeliers the ormolu clocks and the rich draperies and resolutely averts his eyes from the serried ranks of punters or players and the pactolus whose sands are circulating on the green cloth on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he thinks there is no very great harm in looking on and so peeps over the shoulder of a moustached gamester who perhaps whispers to him in the interval between two coups that if a man will only play carefully and be content with moderate gains he may win sufficienttaking the good days and the evil days in a lumpto keep him in a decent kind of affluence all the year round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed i once knew a croupierwe used to call him napoleon from the way he took snuff from his waistcoat pocket who was in the way of expressing a grave conviction that it was possible to make a capital living at roulette so long as you stuck to the colours and avoided the scylla of the numbers and the charybdis of the zero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees then the shyness of the neophyte wears off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps in the course of his descent of avernus a revulsion of feeling takes place and horrorstruck and ashamed he rushes out of the kursaal determined to enter its portals no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he temporizes remembers that there is a capital readingroom provided with all the newspapers and periodicals of civilized europe attached to the kursaalian premises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there can be no harm he thinks in glancing over galignani or the charivari although under the same roof as the abhorred trente et quarante but alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he finds galignani engaged by an acrid old lady of morose countenance who has lost all her money by lunchtime and is determined to take it out in reading and the charivari slightly clenched in one hand by the deaf old gentleman with the dingy ribbon of the legion of honour and the curly brown wig pushed up over one ear who always goes to sleep on the soft and luxurious velvet couches of the kursaal readingroom from eleven till three every day sundays not excepted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the disappointed student of home or foreign news wanders back to one of the apartments where play is going on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact he does not know what to do with himself until tabledhote time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know what the moral satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the unfledged gamester watches the play more narrowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stout lady in a maroon velvet mantle and a man with a bald head a black patch on his occiput and gold spectacles obligingly makes way for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he finds himself pressed against the very edge of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps a chairone of those delightfully comfortable kursaal chairsis vacant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is tired with doing nothing and sinks into the emollientlycushioned fauteuil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fancies that he has caught the eye of the banker or one of the gentlemen of the croupe and that they are meekly inviting him to try his luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well there cant be much harm in risking a florin he murmurs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stakes his silverpiece on a number or a colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wins we will say twice or thrice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps he quadruples his stake nay perchance hits on the lucky number <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it turns up and he receives thirtyfive times the amount of his mise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thenceforth it is all over with that ingenuous british youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the demon of play has him for his own and he may go on playing and playing until he has lost every florin of his own or as many of those belonging to other people as he can beg or borrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far more fortunate for him would it be in the long run if he met in the outset with a good swinging loss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the burnt child does dread the fire as a rule but there is this capricious almost preternatural feature of the physiology of gaming that the young and inexperienced generally win in the first instance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are drawn on and on and in and in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they begin to lose and continue to lose and by the time they have cut their wise teeth they have neither sou nor silver to make their dearlybought wisdom available <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least onehalf of the company may be assumed to be arrant rascalsrascals male and rascals femalechevaliers dindustrie the offscourings of all the shutup gamblinghouses in europe demireps and lorettes single and married women in the course of the three visits he has paid to hombourg mr sala has observed that ninetenths of the english visitors to the kursaal play and he does not hesitate to say that the moths who flutter round the garish lamps at the kursaal van der hohe and its kindred hades almost invariably singe their wings and that the chaseer at roulette and rouge generally turn out edged tools with which those incautious enough to play with them are apt to cut their fingers sometimes very dangerously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the season of in hombourg is thus depicted in a high class newspaper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never within the memory of the oldest inhabitant who in this instance must undoubtedly be that veteran player countess kisselef has the town witnessed such an influx of tourists of every class and description <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hotels and lodginghouses are filled to overflowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every day imprudent travellers who have neglected the precaution of securing rooms before their arrival return disconsolately to frankfort to await the vacation of some apartment which a condescending landlord has promised them after much negotiation for the week after next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning promenade is a wonderful sight such a host of bilious faces such an endless variety of eccentric costumes such a babel of tongues among which the shrill twang of our fair american cousins is peculiarly prominent could be found in no other place in the civilized world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moralist would assuredly find here abundant food for reflection on the wonderful powers of self deception possessed by mankind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all get up at most inconvenient hours swallow a certain quantity of a most nauseous fluid and then having sacrificed so much to appearances soothe our consciences with the unfounded belief that a love of early rising and salt water was our real reason for coming here and that the gambling tables had nothing whatever to do with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps in some few instances this view may be the correct one some few invalids say one in a hundred may have sought hombourg solely in the interest of an impaired digestion but i fear that such cases are few and far between and as a friend afflicted with a mania for misquotation remarked to me the other day even those who come to drink remain to play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly the demon of rouge et noir has never held more undisputed sway in hombourg than in the present season never have the tables groaned under such a load of notes and rouleaux <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would seem as if the gamblers having only two or more years left in which to complete their ruin were hurrying on with redoubled speed to that desirable consummation and where a stake of francs is allowed on a single coup the pace can be made very rapid indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> high play is so common that unless you are lucky enough to win or rich enough to lose a hundred thousand francs at least you need not hope to excite either envy or commiseration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one persevering muscovite who has been punting steadily for six weeks has actually succeeded in getting rid of a million of florins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as yet there have been no suicides to record owing probably to the precautionary measures adopted by a paternal administration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as a gambler is known to be utterly cleared out he at once receives a visit from one of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blancs officials who offers him a small sum on condition he will leave the town forthwith which viaticum however for fear of accidents is only handed to him when fairly seated in the train that bears him away to blow out his brains should he feel so inclined elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the most unpleasant facts connected with the gambling is the ardour displayed by many ladies in this very unfeminine pursuit last night out of twenty five persons seated at the roulette table i counted no fewer than fifteen ladies including an american lady with her two daughters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of prussia has arrived and with due deference to the official editors who have described in glowing paragraphs the popular demonstrations in his honour i am bound to assert that he was received with very modified tokens of delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not even a repetition of the triumphal arch of last year those funereal black and white flags whose sole aspect is enough to repress any exuberance of rejoicing were certainly flapping against the hotel windows and the official flagstaffs but little else testified to the joy of the hombourgers at beholding their sovereign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they manage these things better in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any french prefet would give the german authorities a few useful hints concerning the cheap and speedy manufacture of loyal enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foreigners however seem determined to atone amply for any lack of proper feeling on the part of the townspeople <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they crowd round his majesty as soon as he appears in the rooms or gardens and mob the poor old gentleman with a vigour which taxes all the energies of his aidesdecamp to save their royal master from death by suffocation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> need i add that our old friend the irrepressible arry is ever foremost in these gentlemanlike demonstrations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course the town swarms with wellknown english faces indeed the peers and m.p.s here at present would form a very respectable party in the two houses <end> <end>

<start> <start> a far less respectable class of london society is also i am sorry to say strongly represented i allude to those gentlemen of the lightfingered persuasion whom the outer world rudely designate as pickpockets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this morning two gorgeously arrayed members of the fraternity were marched down to the station by the police each being decorated with a pair of bright steel handcuffs seventeen of them were arrested last week in frankfort at one fell swoop and at the tables the row of lookerson who always surround the players consists in about equal proportions of these gentry and their natural enemiesthe detectives <end> <end>

<start> <start> but the days of the kursaal are numbered and the glories or infamies of hombourg are doomed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in five years from this time the game will be made no longerthe great gambling establishment of hombourg will be a thing of the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town will be obliged to contend on equal terms with other wateringplaces for its share of the wool on the backs of summer excursionists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the townspeople are shareholders in this thriving concern and as all of them gain either directly or indirectly by the play it was amusing to watch the anxiety of these worthies during the war between austria and prussia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> patriotism they had none they cared neither for austrian nor prussian for a great germany nor for a small germany <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the company was their god and their country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that concerned them was to know whether the play was likely to be suppressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were annexed to prussia at first they could not believe that count bismarck whatever he might do with kings would venture to interfere with the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was to them a divine institution something far superior to dynasties and kingdoms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a year the hombourgers were allowed to suppose that their peculiar institution was indeed superior to fate to public opinion and to prussia but at the commencement of the present year they were rudely awakened from their dreams of security <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sword that had been hanging over them fell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the directors of the company were ordered to appear before the governor of the town and they were told that they and all belonging to them were to cease to exist in and that the following arrangement was to be made respecting the plunder gained until that date <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shareholders were to receive per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on their money shares were to be paid off at par each year and if this did not absorb all the profits the surplus was to go towards a fund for keeping up the gardens after the play had ceased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this means as there are now shares will be paid off at par and the remaining will be represented by the buildings and the land belonging to the company which it will be at liberty to sell to the highest bidder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since this decree has been promulgated the hombourgers are in despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the croupiers and the clerks the jews who lend money at high interest the christians who let lodgings all the rogues and swindlers who one way or another make a living out of the play fill the air with their complaints <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although no doubt individuals will suffer by the suppression of public play here it is by no means certain that the town itself will not be a gainer by it <end> <end>

<start> <start> breakfast costs less than a shilling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hombourg is now a fixed fact and if the townspeople take heart and grapple with the new state of thingsif they buy up the kursaal and throw open its salons to visitors if they keep up the opera the cricket club and the shooting if they have good music and balls and concerts for those who like them there is no reason why they should not attract as many visitors aixlachapelle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gaming at aixlachapelle is equally desperate and destructive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a russian officer of my acquaintance says a writer in the annual register for was subject like many of his countrymen whom i have known to the infatuation of play to a most ridiculous excess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his distrust of himself under the assailments which he anticipated at a place like aixlachapelle had induced him to take the prudent precaution of paying in advance at his hotel for his board and lodging and at the bathinghouse for his baths for the time he intended to stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the remaining contents of his purse he thought fairly his own and he went of course to the table all the gayer for the license he had taken of his conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on fortune showing him a few favours he came to me in high spirits with a purse full of napoleons and a resolute determination to keep them by venturing no more but a gamester can no more be stationary than the tide of a river and on the evening he was put out of suspense by having not a napoleon left and nothing to console but congratulation on his foresight and the excellent supper towards the end of the last century aixlachapelle was a great rendezvous of gamblers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chief banker there paid a thousand louis per annum for his license <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little italian adventurer once went to the place with only a few louis in his pocket and played crown stakes at hazard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortune smiled on him he increased his stakes progressively in twentyfour hours won about l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the following day he stripped the bank entirely pocketing nearly l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he continued to play for some days till he was at last reduced to a single louis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he now obtained from a friend the loan of l and once more resumed his station at the gaming table which he once more quitted with l in his pocket and resolved to leave it for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the arguments of one of the bankers however who followed him to his inn soon prevailed over his resolution and on his return to the gaming table he was stripped of his last farthing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went to his lodgings sold his clothes and by that means again appeared at his old haunt for the halfcrown stakes by which he honourably repaid his loan of l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his end was unknown to the relater of the anecdote but ten to one it was ruin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same place in the year the heirapparent of an irish marquis lost at various times nearly l at a billiard table partly owing to his antagonist being an excellent calculator as well as a superior player <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a french emigrant at aixlachapelle who carried a basket of tarts liqueurs c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for regaling the gamesters put down twentyfive louis at rouge et noir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then put down fifteen and lost again at the third turn he staked ten but while the cards were being shuffled seeming to recollect himself he felt all his pockets and at length found two large french crowns and a small one which he also ventured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deal was determined at the ninth card and the poor wretch who had lost his all dashed down his basket started from his seat overturning two chairs as he forced the circle tore off his hair and with horrid blasphemies burst the folding doors and rushing out like a madman was seen no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another emigrant arrived here penniless but meeting a friend obtained the loan of a few crowns nearly his all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with these he went to the rooms put down his stake and won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then successively doubled his stakes till he closed the evening with a hundred louis in his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went to his friend and with mutual congratulations they resolved to venture no more and calculated how long their gains would support them from absolute want and thus seemed to strengthen their wise resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next night however the lucky gambler returned to the room but only to be a spectator as he firmly said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his resolution failed him and he quitted the tables indebted to a charitable bystander for a livre or two to pay for his petty refreshments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is said that the annual profit to the bankers was florins or l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very name of aixlachapelle says a traveller makes one think at least makes me think of cards and dicesharks and pigeons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has a professional odour upon it which is certainly not that of sanctity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i entered the redoute with my head full of sham barons german catalinas and the thousandand one popular tales of renowned knights of the green cloththeir seducing confederates and infatuated dupes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rooms are well distributed the saloons handsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sparkling of ladies apparently and really as i understood of the best water the elite in short of aixlachapelle were lounging on sofas placed round the principal saloon or fluttering about amidst a crowd of men who filled up the centre of the room or thronged round the tables that were ranged on one side of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the players continued their occupation in deathlike silence undisturbed by the buzz or the gaze of the lookerson not a sound was heard but the rattle of the heapedup money as it was passed from one side of the table to the other nor was the smallest anxiety or emotion visible on any countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scene was unpleasing though to me curious from its novelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ladies are admitted to play but there were none occupied this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was glad of it indeed though english travellers are accused of carrying about with them a portable code of morality which dissolves or stiffens like a soapcake as circumstances may affect its consistency yet i sincerely believe that there are few amongst us who would not feel shocked at seeing one of the reminiscences of the rhine c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gambling here in has been described in a very vivid manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since the enforcement of the prussian sunday observance regulations monday has become the great day of the week for the banks of the german gambling establishments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anxious to make up for lost time the regular contributors to the companys dividends flock early on monday forenoon to the playrooms in order to secure good places at the tables which by the appointed hour for commencing operations eleven oclock are closely hedged round by persons of both sexes eagerly waiting for the first deal of the cards or the initial twist of the brass wheel that they may try another fall with fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before each seated player are arranged precious little piles of gold and silver a card printed in black and red and a long pin wherewith to prick out a system of infallible gain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the croupiers take their seats and unpack the strong box rouleaux long metal sausages composed of double and single florins wooden bowls brimming over with gold frederics and napoleons bank notes of all sizes and colours are arranged upon the black leather compartment ruled over by the companys officers halfadozen packs of new cards are stripped of their paper cases and swiftly shuffled together and when all these preliminaries watched with breathless anxiety by the surrounding speculators have been gravely and carefully executed the chief croupier looks round hima signal for the prompt investment of capital on all parts of the tablechucks out a handful of cards from the mass packed together convenient to his handejaculates the formula faites le jeu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after half a minutes pause during which he delicately moistens the ball of his dealing thumb exclaims le jeu est fait rien ne va plus and proceeds to interpret the decrees of fate according to the approved fashion of trente et quarante <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a similar scene is taking place at the roulette tablea goodly crop of florins with here and there a speck of gold shining amongst the silver harvest is being sown over the field of the cloth of green soon to be reaped by the croupiers sickle and the pith ball is being dropped into the revolving basin that is partitioned off into so many tiny black and red niches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the next twelve hours the processes in question are carried on swiftly and steadily without variation or loss of time relays of croupiers are laid on who unobtrusively slip into the places of their fellows when the hours arrive for relieving guard the game is never stopped for more than a couple of minutes at a time viz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the cards run out and have to be reshuffled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this brief interruption is commonly considered to portend a break in the particular vein which the game may have happened to assume during the dealsay a run upon black or red an alternation of coups in threes or fours upon either colour two reds and a black or vice versa all equally frequent eccentricities of the cards and the heavier players often change their seats or leave the table altogether for an hour or so at such a conjuncture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> curiously enough excepting at the very commencement of the days play the habitues of the trente et quarante tables appear to entertain a strong antipathy to the first deal or two after the cards have been remade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been told by one or two masters of the craft that they have a fancy to see how matters are likely to go before they strike in as if it were possible to deduce the future of the game from its past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it is possible appears to be an article of faith with the old stagers and indeed every now and then odd coincidences occur which tend to confirm them in their creed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i witnessed an occurrence which was either attributable as i believe to sheer chance or as its hero earnestly assured me to instinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fair and frail magyar was punting on numbers with immense pluck and uniform ill fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind her stood a viennese gentleman of my acquaintance who enjoys a certain renown amongst his friends for the faculty of prophecy which however he seldom exercises for his own benefit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observing that she hesitated about staking her double florin he advised her to set it on the number  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> round went the wheel and in twenty seconds the ball tumbled into compartment sure enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the next turn she asked his advice and was told to try number  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner said than done and came up in due course whereby mdlle l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> won odd gulden in two coups the amount risked by her being exactly four florins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a wise girl she walked off with her booty and played no more that day at roulette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few minutes later i saw an englishman go through the performance of losing four thousand francs by experimentalizing on single numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twenty times running did he set ten louisdors on a number varying the number at each stake and not one of his selection proved successful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the thirty and forty i saw an eminent diplomatist win sixty thousand francs with scarcely an intermission of failure he played all over the table pushing his rouleaux backwards and forwards from black to red without any appearance of system that i could detect and the cards seemed to follow his inspiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a great battle as usual three or four smaller fish followed in his wake till they lost courage and set against him much to their discomfiture and the advantage of the bank but from first to lastthat is till the cards ran out and he left the tablehe was steadily victorious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the evening he went in again for another heavy bout at which i chanced to be present but fortune had forsaken him and he not only lost his mornings winnings but eight thousand francs to boot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not remember to have ever seen the tables so crowdedoutside it was thundering lightening and raining as if the world were coming to an end and the whole floating population of wiesbaden was driven into the kursaal by the weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a roaring time of it had the bank when play was over about which time the rain ceased hundreds of hot and thirsty gamblers streamed out of the reeking rooms to the glazed in terrace and the next hour always the pleasantest of the twentyfour here and in hombourgat ems people go straight from the tables to bedwas devoted to animated chat and unlimited sherrycobbler all the events of the day were passed in review experiences exchanged and confessions made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody had won i could not hear of a single great successthe bank had had it all its own way and most of the lions worsted in the fray had evidently made up their minds to drown it in the bowl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the russian detachmenta very strong one this yearwas especially hard hit spain and italy were both unusually low spirited and there was an extra solemnity about the british isles that told its own sad tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> englishmen when they have lost more than they can afford generally take it out of themselves in surly brooding selfreproach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frenchmen give vent to their disgust and annoyance by abusing the game and its myrmidons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may hear them loud and savage on the terrace ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> comment peuton se laisser eplucher par des brigands de la sorte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> italians again endeavour to conceal their discomfiture under a flow of feverish gaiety <end> <end>

<start> <start> light up their cigars drink a dozen or so hocks and subside into their usual state of ponderous cheerfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> russians betray no emotion whatever over their calamities save perhaps that they smoke those famous little laferme cigarettes a trifle faster and more nervously than at other times but they are excellent winners and magnificent losers only to be surpassed in either respect by their old enemy the turk who is facile princeps in the art of hiding his feelings from the outer world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great mass of visitors at wiesbaden this season as at hombourg belong to the middle and lower middle classes leavened by a very few celebrities and persons of genuine distinction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are a dozen or two eminent men here not to be seen in the playrooms who are taking the waterslord clarendon baron rothschild prince souvarof and a few morebut the general run of guests is by no means remarkable for birth wealth or respectability and we are shockingly off for ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a setoff against this deficiency it would seem that all the aged brokendown courtesans of paris vienna and berlin have agreed to make wiesbaden their autumn rendezvous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arrayed in all the colours of the rainbow painted up to the roots of their dyed hair shamelessly decolletees prodigal of free talk and unseemly gesture these ghastly creatures hideous caricatures of youth and beauty flaunt about the playrooms and gardens levying blackmail upon those who are imprudent enough to engage them in chaff or badinage and desperately endeavouring to hook themselves on to the wealthier and younger members of the male community <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they poison the air round them with sickly perfumes they assume titles and speak of one another as cette chere comtesse their walk is something between a prance and a wriggle they prowl about the terrace whilst the music is playing seeking whom they may devour or rather whom they may inveigle into paying for their devouring and bon dieu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how they do gorge themselves with food and drink when some silly lad or aged roue allows himself to be bullied or wheedled into paying their scot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their name is legion and they constitute the very worst feature of a place which naturally a paradise is turned into a seventh hell by the uncontrolled rioting of human passions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have no friendsno protectors they are dependent upon accident for a meal or a piece of gold to throw away at the tables they are plaguespots upon the face of society they are as a rule crassly ignorant and horribly cynical and yet there are many men here who are proud of their acquaintance always ready to entertain them in the most expensive manner and who speak of them as if they were the only desirable companions in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amongst our notabilities of the eccentric sort not the least singular in her behaviour is the countess co an aged patrician of immense fortune who is as constant to wiesbaden as old madame de kf is to hombourg on the heights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the lastnamed lady she is daily wheeled to her place in the black and red temple and plays away for eight or nine hours with wonderful spirit and perseverance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has with her a suite of eight domestics and when she wins which is not often on returning to her hotel at night she presents each member of her retinue withtwopence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not as she naively avows from a feeling of generosity but to propitiate fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she loses none of them save the man who wheels her home get anything but hard words from her and he happy fellow receives a donation of six kreutzers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she does not curse the croupiers loudly for her bad luck like her contemporary the once lovely russian ambassadress but being very far advanced in years and of a tender disposition sheds tears over her misfortunes resting her chin on the edge of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an edifying sight is this venerable dame bearing an exalted title as she mopes and mouths over her varying luck missing her stake twice out of three times when she fain would push it with her rake into some particular section of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is very intimate with one or two antediluvian diplomatists and warriors who are here striving to bolster themselves up for another year with the waters and may be heard crowing out lamentations over her fatal passion for play interspersed with bits of mossgrown scandal disinterred from the social ruins of an age long past radetzky wratislaw le beau sabreur the two schwarzenbergs he of leipsic and the former prime minister paul eszterhazy wrangel and blucher were friends of her youth judging from her appearance one would not be surprised to hear that she had received a poulet from baron trenck or played whist with maria theresa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has outlived all human friendships or affections and exists only for the chink of the gold as it jingles on the gaming table <end> <end>

<start> <start> she is a great and daily telegraph aug <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doom of the german gaming houses seems to be settled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will all be closed in as appears by the following the prussian government not having been able to obtain from the lessees of the gaming tables at wiesbaden ems and hombourg their consent to their cancelling of their contracts has resolved to terminate their privileges by a legislative measure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has presented a bill to the chamber of deputies at berlin fixing the year as the limit to the existence of these establishments and even authorizing the government to suppress them at an earlier period by a royal ordinance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no indemnity is to be allowed to the persons holding concessionsfeb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a london newspaper defends this measure in a very successful manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prussia has declared her purpose to eradicate from the territories subject to her increased sway and from others recognizing her influence the disgrace of the rouge et noir and the roulette table as public institutions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her reasoning is to the effect that they bring scandal upon germany that they associate with the names of its favourite wateringplaces the appellation of hells that they attract swindlers and adventurers of every degree and that they have for many a year past been held up to the opprobrium of europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for why should this practice be a lawful practice of germany and of no other country in europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not in france in spain in italy in the northern states in great britain itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us not give to this last proposition more importance than it is worth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the german wateringplaces are places of leisure of trifling of ennui <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is why originally they were selected as encampments by the tribes which fatten upon hazards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was another reason they brought in welcome revenues to needy princes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even now in view of the contemplated expurgation monaco is named with geneva as successor to the perishing glories of hombourg wiesbaden and the great baden itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is to say the gamblers or rather the professionals who live upon the gambling propensities of others having received from prussia and her friends notice to quit are in search of new lodgings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the question is they being determined and the accommodation being not less certainly ready for them than the sea is for the tribute of a river will the reform designed be a really progressive step in the civilization of europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prussia says decidedly so because it will demolish an infamous privilege <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she affirms that an institution which might have been excusable under a landgrave with a few thousand acres of territory is inconsistent with the dignity and to quote continental phraseology the mission of a firstclass state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here again the reasoning is incontrovertible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of one other thing moreover we may feel perfectly sure that prussia having determined to suppress these centres and sources of corruption they will gradually disappear from europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> concede to them a temporary breathingtime at monaco the time left for even a nominally independent existence to monaco is short imagine that they find a fresh outlet at geneva prussia will have represented the public opinion of the age against which not even the republicanism of switzerland can long make a successful stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the whole history can never blame prussia for such a use either of her conquests or her influence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say what you will gambling is an indulgence blushed over in england abroad practised as a little luxury in dissipation it may be pardoned as venial habitually however it is a leprosy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as it is by habitual gamblers that these haunts are made to flourish this alone should reconcile the world of tourists to a deprivation which for them must be slight while to the class they imitate without equalling it will be the prohibition of an abominable extracts from a leader in the standard of sept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not surprising that a people so intensely speculative excitable and eager as the americans should be desperately addicted to gambling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed the spirit of gambling has incessantly pervaded all their operations political commercial and social <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is but one of the manifestations of that thorough license arrogated to itself by the nation finding its true expression in the american maxim recorded by mr hepworth dixon so coarsely worded but so significantevery man in the american correspondence of the morning advertiser feb <end> <end>

<start> <start> mrs obadiah snedecker the buxom wife of mine host was famous for the exquisite way in which she cooked veal cutlets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were two niggers in the establishment named steve and dick who accompanied the gentlemen in their angling excursions amusing them with their stolidity and the enormous quantity of gin they could imbibe without being more than normally fuddled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after fishing the gentlemen used to take to gambling at the usual french games but here pat hern appeared not in the character of gambler but as a private gentleman <end> <end>

<start> <start> he afterwards set up a bar or publichouse and over this he established a small faro bank which he enlarged and improved by degrees until it became well known and was very much frequented by the gamblers of new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is now i believe a member of congress for that city and immensely wealthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not content with his successful gambling operations in new york he has opened a splendid establishment at the fashionable summer resort of saratoga consisting of an immense hotel ballrooms and gamblingrooms and is said to have a profit of two millions of dollars about l during the season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is mentioned as one of those who pay the most income tax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morrisseys gambling house is in union square and is said to be magnificently furnished and distinguished by the most princely hospitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at all hours of the day or night tables are laid out with every description of refreshment to which all who visit the place are welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a remarkable feature in the american system <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at all bars or publichouses you find provided free of charge supplies of cheese biscuits c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and sometimes even some savoury soupwhich are often resorted to by those unfortunates who are clean broke or used up with little else to assuage the pangs of hunger but the everlasting quid of tobacco furiously chawed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another generous feature of the american system is that the barman does not measure out to you after our stingy fashion what drink you may require but hands you the tumbler and bottle to help yourself unless in the case of made drinks such as mintjuleps c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however you must drink your liquor at a gulp after the yankee fashion for if you take a sip and turn your back to the counter your glass will disappearas it is not customary to have glasses standing about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morrisseys wines are very good and always supplied in abundance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost every game of chance is played at this establishment and the stakes are very high and unlimited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the visitors are the wealthy and wild young men of new york and occasionally a southernlooking man who perhaps has saved some of his property being still the same professional gambler for it may be affirmed that all the southern planters were addicted to gambling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same flocks of welldressed and fashionablelooking men of all ages pass in and out all through the day and night tens of thousands of dollars are lost and won the click of the markers never ceases all speak in a low tone everything has a serious quiet appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dealers seem to know every one and nod familiarly to all who approach their tables <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john morrissey is occasionally to be seen walking through the rooms apparently a disinterested spectator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a short thickset man of about years dark complexion and wears a long beard dresses in a slovenly manner and walks with a swagger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then he approaches the table makes a few bets and is then lost ubi supra <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same writer furnishes other very interesting facts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the operahouse and theatres are closed morrisseys gambling house becomes very full in fact the best time to see it to advantage is about two or three oclock in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little below the new york hotel and on the opposite side of broadway there is a gambling house not quite so respectable as the one i have been describing here the stakes are not below a dollar and not more than twentyfive there are no refreshments gratis and the rooms are not so well furnished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men to be seen gaming in this house differ but very little in appearance from those in union square but there seems to be less discipline amongst them and more noise and confusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a rare thing to see an intoxicated man in a gambling house the doorkeepers are very particular as to whom they admit and any disturbance which might call for the interference of the police would be ruinous to their business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the police are undoubtedly aware of everything going on in these houses and do not interfere as long as everything goes on quietly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and then a clerk spends his employers money and if it is discovered where he lost it then a raid is made by the police in force the tables and all the gaming paraphernalia are carried off and the proprietors heavily fined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i witnessed a case of this a young man in the employment of a commission merchant appropriated a large sum of his employers money and lost it at faro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was arrested and confessed what he had done with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the police at once proceeded to the house where the faro bank was kept and the scene when it was known that the police were below beggars description <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tables were upset and notes and markers were flying about in all directions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men sprawling and scrambling on the floor fought with one another for whatever they could seize then the police entered and cleared the house having arrested the owners of the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was in one of the lowest gaming houses where skin games cheating games are practised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the gambling house in broadway near the new york hotel i have often noticed a young man apparently of some or years of age fashionably dressed and of prepossessing appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on some days he would play very high and seemed to have most remarkable luck but he always played with the air of an old gamester seeming careless as to whether he won or lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night he lost so heavily that he attracted the notice of all the players every stake of his was swept away and he still played on until his last dollar was lost then he quietly walked out whistling a popular yankee air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was there next day minus his greatcoat and watch and chainhe lost again went out and returned in his shirt sleeves having pawned his coat studs and everything he could with decency divest himself of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lost everything and when i next saw him he was selling newspapers in front of the postoffice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mania for gambling is a most singular one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have known a man to win a thousand dollars in a few hours and yet he would not spend a dollar to get a dinner but when he felt hungry he went to a bakers shop and bought a loaf of bread and that same night lost all his money at roulette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is another house on the corner of centre and grand streets open during night and day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stakes here are the same as in the one in broadway and the people who play are very much the samein fact the same faces are constantly to be met with in all the gambling houses from the highest to the lowest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a gambler has but small capital he will go to a small house where small stakes are admissible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw a man win or dollars at this place and then hand in his checks markers to be cashed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dealer handed him the money and saidnow you go off straight away to union square and pay away all you have won from here to john morrissey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the way with all of them they never come here until they are dead broke and have only a dirty dollar or so to risk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was some truth in what he said but notwithstanding he managed to keep the bank going on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a great temptation to a man who has won a sum of money at a small gambling house to go to a higher one as he may then at a single stake win as much as he could possibly win if he had a run of luck in a dozen stakes at the smaller bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the bowery there is one of the lowest of the gaming houses i have seen in the empire city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the proprietor is an irishman he employs three men as dealers and they relieve one another every four hours during the day and night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stakes here are of the lowest and the people to be seen here of the roughest to be found in the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the game is faro as elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this place i met an old friend with whom i had served in the army of northern virginia under general lee in his virginia campaign of  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told me he had been in new york since the end of the war and lived a very uncertain sort of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever money he could earn he spent at the gaming table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes he had a run of luck and whilst it lasted he dressed well and stopped at the most expensive hotels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night he would sleep at the astor house and perhaps the next night he would not be able to pay for his bed and would stay all night in the parks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strange to say hundreds live in this way which is vulgarly called scratching in new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i afterwards saw my friend driving an omnibus and when i could speak to him i found that he was still attending the banks with every cent he earned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is amusing to watch the proprietor of this place at the bowery he has a joke for every one he sees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cries come and try your luckyou look lucky this evening and if you make a good run you may sport a gold watch and chain and a velvet vest like myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then to another young cleartheway you look down at the mouth tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come along and have a turnand never mind your supper tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this way the days and nights are passed in those gambling there is also in new york an association for the prevention of gambling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the society employs detectives to visit the gambling saloons and procure evidence for the suppression of the establishments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the business of these agents also to ascertain the names and occupations of those who frequent the gambling rooms and a list of the persons thus detected is sent periodically to the subscribers to the society that they may know who are the persons wasting their money or perhaps the money of their employers in gambling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many large houses of business subscribe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the month of august the societys agents detected among the gamblers clerks of mercantile houses and in the previous six months reported cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is stated that there are in new york and brooklyn policy and lottery offices and faro banks and that their net annual gains are not less than dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at american gambling houses it is very easy says the same writer to distinguish the professional from the ordinary gambler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter has a nervous expression about the mouth and an intense gaze upon the cards and altogether a very serious nervous appearance while the professional plays in a very quiet manner and seems to care but little how the game goes and his desire to appear as if the game was new to him is almost certain to expose him to those who know the manoeuvre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> previous to the struggle for independence in the south there were many hundreds of gamblers scattered through the southern towns and the mississippi steamboats used to abound with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the south a gambler was regarded as outside the pale of society and classed with the slavetrader who was looked upon with loathing by the very same men who traded with him such was the inconsistency of public opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the american gambler differs from his european brethren in many respects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is very frequently in education appearance and manner a gentleman and if his private history were known it would be found that he was of good birth and was at one time possessed of considerable fortune but having lost all at the gambling table he gradually came down to the level of those who proved his ruin and having no profession nor means of livelihood left to him he adopted their mode of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one occasion i met a brother of a southern general very famous in the late war and still a wealthy man who at one time was one of the richest planters in the state of louisiana and is now acting as an agent for a set of gamblers to their gaming houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after losing everything he had he became a croupier to a gambling house in new orleans and afterwards plied his trade on the mississippi for some years then he went into mexico and finally to new york where he opened a house on his own account <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the war he speculated in greenbacks and lost all his illgotten gains and had to descend to his present ubi supra <end> <end> 
<start> <start> draw poker or bluff is a favourite game with the americans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is played by any number of persons from four to seven four five or six players are preferred seven are only engaged where a party of friends consists of that number and all require to be equally amused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deal is usually determined by fixing on a card and dealing round face upwards until such card appears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dealer then places in the pool an ante or certain agreedupon sum and proceeds to deal to each person five cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the player next to the dealer before looking at his cards has the option of staking a certain sum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is called the blind and makes him the elder hand or last player and when his turn comes round he can by giving up his first stake withdraw from the game or if he pleases by making good any sum staked by a previous player raise the stakes to any sum he pleases provided of course that no limit has been fixed before sitting down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the privilege of raising or doubling on the blind may be exercised by any one round the table provided he has not looked at his cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if no intervening player has met the original blind that is staked double the sum this must be done by all who wish to play and of course must be made good by the last player <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each person then looks at his cards and decides on his plan of action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it should be understood that every one except the blind may look at his cards in his turn before deciding if he will meet the blind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before speaking of the manner of drawing it will be better to give the relative value of the hands which will much simplify the matter and make it more easily understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus four aces are the best cards that can be held four kings next and so on down to four twos four cards of the same value beating anything except four of a higher denomination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next best hand is called a full and is made up thus three aces and a pair of sixes three nines and pair of twos in fact any three cards of the same value and a pair constitute a full hand and can only be beaten by a full hand of a higher denomination or fours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next hand that takes precedence is a flush or five cards of one colour after this comes threes vis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three cards all of the same value say three aces kings queens and so on downwards the two remaining being odd ones are of no value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next is a sequence as five following cards for instance nine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eight seven six five it is not necessary they should all be of one colour as this of course would constitute a flush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next come two pairs say two knaves and two fives and last of all is a single pair of cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having explained the value of the hands let us show how you endeavour to get them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bets having been made and the blind made good or abandoned or given up the dealer proceeds to ask each player in his turn how many cards he wants and here begins the first study of the gameto know what to throw away in order to get in others to make the hand better if possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your hand may of course be so utterly bad as to make it necessary to throw away the whole five and draw five new ones this is not very likely as few players will put a stake in the pool unless on looking first at his cards he has seen something say a pair to start with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will suppose he has this and of course he throws away three cards and draws three in place of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to describe the proper way to fill up a hand is impossible we can but give an instance here and there to show the varying interest which attaches to the gamethus you may have threes in the original hand dealt some players will throw away the two odd cards and draw two more to try and make the hand fours or at least a full while a player knowing that his is not a very good hand will endeavour to deceive the rest by standing out that is not taking any fresh cards of course all round the table make remarks as to what he can possibly have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is usually taken to be a sequence as this requires no drawing if originally dealt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same remark applies to a flush two pairs or four to a flush of course require one card to make them into good hands a player being only entitled to draw once and the hands being made good the real and exciting part of the game begins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each one endeavours to keep his real position a secret from his neighbours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some put on a look of calm indifference and try to seem selfpossessed some will grin and talk all sorts of nonsense some will utter sly bits of badinage while others will study intently their cards or gaze at the ceilingall which is done merely to distract attention or to conceal the feelings as the chance of success or failure be for or against and then begins the betting or gambling part of the game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the player next the blind is the first to declare his bet in which of course he is entirely governed by circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some being the first to bet and having a very good card indeed will bet small in hopes that some one else will see it and go better that is bet more so that when it comes round to his turn again he may see all previous bets and bet as much higher as he thinks proper for it must be borne in mind that a players first bet does not preclude him from coming in again if his first bet has been raised upon by any player round the table in his turn but if once the original bet goes round and comes to the blind or last player without any one going better the game is closed and it becomes a show of hands to see who takes the pool and all the bets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this does not often happen as there is usually some one round the table to raise it but my informant has seen it occur and has been highly amused at watching the countenance of the expectant small better at having to show a fine hand for a mere trifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some players will in order to conceal their method of play occasionally throw their cards among the waste ones and abandon their stakes this is not often done but it sometimes happens where the stakes have been small or the player has been trying a bluff and has found some one whom he could not bluff off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foregoing is a concise account of the game as played in america where it is of universal interest and exercises great fascination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is often played by parties of friends who meet regularly for the purpose and instances can be found where fortunes have been lost in a night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the game of pokers differs from the one just described in so far that the players receive only the original five cards dealt without drawing fresh ones and must either play or refuse on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this game as there are more cards as many as ten persons can play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lansquenet is much played by the americans and is one of the most exciting games in vogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dealer or banker stakes a certain sum and this must be met by the nearest to the dealer first and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the stake is met the dealer turns up two cards one to the rightthe latter for himself the former for the table or the players <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then keeps on turning up the cards until either of the cards is matched which constitutes the winningas for instance suppose the five of diamonds is his card then should the five of any other suit turn up he wins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he loses then the next player on the left becomes banker and proceeds in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this name is derived from the german landsknecht valet of the fief applied to a mercenary soldier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the dealers card turns up he may take the stake and pass the bank or he may allow the stake to remain whereat of course it becomes doubled if met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can continue thus as long as the cards turn up in his favourhaving the option at any moment of giving up the bank and retiring for that time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he does that the player to whom he passes the bank has the option of continuing it at the same amount at which it was left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pool may be made up by contributions of all the players in certain proportions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the terms used respecting the standing of the stake are ill see a moi le tout and je tiens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when jumelle twins or the turning up of similar cards on both sides occurs then the dealer takes half the stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes there is a run of several consecutive winnings but on one occasion on board one of the cunard steamers a banker at the game turned up in his own favour i think no less than eighteen times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the original stake was only sixpence but had each stake been met as won the final doubling would have amounted to the immense sum of l s. <end> <end> 
<start> <start> st turn up th turn up nd th rd th th th th th th th th th th th in fair play as this is represented to have been such a long sequence of matches must be considered very remarkable although six or seven is not unfrequent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unfortunately however there is a very easy means by which card sharpers manage the thing to perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they prepare beforehand st queen th nine nd queen th nine rd ten th ace th seven th eight series thus arranged are placed in side pockets outside the waistcoat just under the left breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the sharper becomes banker he leans negligently over the table and in this position his fingers are as close as possible to the prepared cards termed portees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the proper moment he seizes the cards and places them on the pack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trick is rendered very easy by the fact that the cardsharper has his coat buttoned at the top so that the lower part of it lies open and permits the introduction of the hand which is completely masked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some sharpers are skilful enough to take up some of the matches already dealt which they place in their costieres or side pockets above described in readiness for their next operation others keep them skilfully hidden in their hand to lay them at the convenient moment upon the pack of cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this means in france the stakes commence at francs and it may be easily imagined how soon vast sums of money may change hands if the players are determined and reckless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is also a game much played in the states <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose it is a yankee invention named by one of their learned professors from the greek gr euceis eucheir meaning well in the hand or stronga very appropriate designation of the game which is in this game all the cards are excluded up to the sixesseven being the lowest in the euchre pack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five cards are dealt out after the usual shuffling and cutting with a turnup or trump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dealer has the privilege of discarding one of his cards and taking up the trumpnot showing however the one he discards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the knave is the best card in the gamea peculiar yankee notion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the knave of trumps is called the right bower and the other knave of the same colour is the left bower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence it appears that the nautical propensity of this great people is therein representedbower being in fact a sheet anchor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if both are held it is evident that the point of the deal is decidedsince it results from taking three tricks out of the five for of course the trump card appropriated by the dealer will most probably secure a trick and the two knaves must necessarily make two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the game may be five or seven points as agreed upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> euchre is rapid and decisive and therefore eminently american <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of the games played by the americans are peculiar to themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance vast sums of money change hands over fly loo or the attraction existing between lumps of sugar and adventurous flies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this game is not without its excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gamblers sit round a table each with a lump of sugar before him and the player upon whose lump a fly first perches carries off the poolwhich is sometimes enormous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they tell an anecdote of a cute yankee who won invariably and immensely at the game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there seemed to be a sort of magical or mesmeric attraction for the flies to his lump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length it was ascertained that he touched the lump with his finger after having smeared it with something that naturally and irresistibly attracts flies whenever they can get at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am told that this game is also played in england if so the parties must insist upon fresh lumps of sugar and prevent all touching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reader will probably askwhat next will gamblers think of betting on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i can tell of a still more curious source of gambling infatuation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the oxford magazine is the vol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few days ago as some sprigs of nobility were dining together at a tavern they took the following conceit into their heads after dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them observing a maggot come from a filbert which seemed to be uncommonly large attempted to get it from his companion who not choosing to let it go was immediately offered five guineas for it which was accepted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then proposed to run it against any other two maggots that could be produced at table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matches were accordingly made and these poor reptiles were the means of l being won and lost in a the crimes of american gamblers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suicides duels and murders have frequently resulted from gambling here as elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many of the duels in dark rooms originate in disputes at the gaming table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the combatants rush from play to an upper or adjoining room and settle their difference with revolvershots often fatal to both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these was a seriocomic affair which is perhaps worth relating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two players had a gambling dispute and resolved to settle it in a dark room with pistols <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door was locked and one of them fired but missed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this the other exclaimed now you rascal ill finish you at my leisure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then began to search for his opponent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three or four times he walked stealthily round the roombut all in vainhe could not find his man he listened he could not hear him breathe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length he exclaimednow ive got you you sneakhere goes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried a voice from the chimney dont fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill pay you anything.do take away that pistol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in effect his adversary held the muzzle of his pistol close to the seat of honour as the fellow stood stuffed up the chimney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the former very well yes yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gasped the voice in the chimney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well rejoined the tormentor but just wait a bit i must have a voucher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill just cut off the bottom of your breeches by way of voucher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so saying he pulled out his knife and suited the action to the words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now get down he said and out with the money which was paid when the abovenamed voucher was returned to the chimney groper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town of vicksburg on the mississippi was formerly notorious as the rendezvous of all sorts of desperadoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a city of men you saw no women except at night and never any children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vicksburg was a sink of iniquity and there gambling raged with unrestricted fury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was always after touching at vicksburg that the mississippi boats became the wellknown scene of gamblingsome of the vicksburghers invariably getting on board to ply their profession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one occasion one of these came on board and soon induced some of the passengers to proceed to the upper promenadedeck for gambling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon the stakes increased and a heap of gold was on the table when a dispute arose in the midst of which one of the players placed his hand on the stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon the vicksburg gambler drew his knife and plunged it into the hand of the former with a terrible imprecation <end> <end>

<start> <start> byandby one of them accused the other of cheating which was denied when the mexican interposed and told the negro that he saw him cheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter told the mexican that he liedwhereupon the mexican stabbed him to the heart killing him on the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon the negros master came out and on being informed of the affair turned to the mexican sayingnow sir we must settle the matter between usmy negros quarrel is mine <end> <end>

<start> <start> about six and twenty years ago there lived in new york a wellto do merchant of the name of osborne who had an only son who was a partner in the concern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man fell in love with the daughter of a southern planter then on a visit at new york to whom he engaged himself to be married with the perfect consent of all parties concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the return of the planter and his daughter young osborne accompanied them to mobile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the very night of their arrival the planter proposed to his intended soninlaw to visit the gaming table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went osborne was unlucky and after some hours play lost an immense amount to the father of his sweetheart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave bills drawn on his house in payment of the debt of honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the following morning the planter referred to the subject hinting that osborne must be ruined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the young man but the possession of your daughter will console me for the calamity which i doubt not i the possession of my daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the planter do you think i would marry my daughter to a beggar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no sir the affair is ended between youand i insist upon its being utterly broken off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such was the action of the heartless gambler rendered callous to all sentiments of real honour by his debasing pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young osborne was equal to the occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> summoning all his powers to manfully bear this additional shock of fate he calmly so be it sir as you wish it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> depend upon it however that my bills will be duly honouredand so saying he bowed and departed without even wishing to take leave of his betrothed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on returning to new york osborne immediately disclosed the transaction to his father who in spite of the utter ruin which impended and the brutality of the cause of the ruin resolved to meet the bills when due and maintain the honour of his son whatever might be the consequences to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bills were paid the concern was broken up old mr osborne soon died brokenhearted and young osborne went as clerk to some house of business in wall street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a year or so passed away and one day a lady presented herself at the old house of osbornenow no longer theirsinquiring for young osborne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was directed to his new place of business being no other than his betrothed who loved him as passionately as ever and to whom her father had accounted for the non fulfilment of the engagement in a very unsatisfactory manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course osborne could not fail to be delighted at this proof of her devotedness the meeting was most affectionate on both sides and with the view of coming to a decision respecting their future proceedings they adjourned to an hotel in the vicinity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here whilst seated at a table and in earnest conversation the young ladys father rushed in and instantly shot down osborne who expired at his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a frantic shriek the poor girl fell on the body of her betrothed and finding a poniard or a knife concealed in his breast she seized it instantly plunged it into her heart and was soon a corpse beside her lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passions of the two sexes are similar in the main the distinctions between them result less from nature than from education <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often we meet with women especially the literary sort who seem veritable men if not so as the lawyers say to all intents and purposes and often we meet with men especially towndandies who can only be compared to very ordinary women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost all the ancients had the bad taste to speak ill of women among the rest even that delightful old father of the golden mouth st chrysostom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that evidently dr johnsons fierce dictum cannot apply universallyonly scoundrels speak hom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having read through the long case as reported in the times i must declare that i do not find that the evidence against lord de ros was after all so overwhelming as the reviewer declares indeed the leader in the times on the trial emphatically raises a doubt on the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among other passages in it there in the process of the trial it appeared that the most material part of the evidence against lord de ros that called sauter la coupewhich for the sake of our english readers we shall translate into changing the turnup cardthe times and places at which it was said to have been done could not be specified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of the witnesses had seen the trick done or times by lord de ros but could neither say on what day in what week month or even year they had so seen it done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people were excessively struck at this deviation from the extreme punctuality the disclosures says mr grant which took place in the court of queens bench on the occasion of the trial of lord de ros for cheating at cards furnished the strongest demonstration that he was not the only person who was in the habit of cheating in certain clubs while there were others who if they could not be charged with direct cheating or cheating in their own persons did cheat indirectly and by proxy inasmuch as they by their own admission were on frequent occasions partners with lord de ros long after they knew that he habitually or systematically cheated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noble lord by the confession of the titled parties to whom i allude thus cheated for himself and sketches in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord de ros was at the head of the barons of england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the son of lord henry fitzgerald and lady de ros who inherited in her own right that ancient title which dates from the reign of henry iii <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had studied at eton and oxford and afterwards on the continent and there was not a more accomplished man in europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he possessed an ample fortune was a member of several of the clubswhites boodles brookes and grahams and one of the best whist players in england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appears that at grahams club at the commencement of the season and before lord de ros came to town whispers were circulated of unfair play and various persons were supposed guilty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a determination was therefore formed that the club should be dissolved and reconstructed leaving out the names of certain persons to whom suspicion attached <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the main object of the master of the club and of some of those who attended it for the purpose of professional gain was that its character should be cleared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not long after lord de ros came to town he received an anonymous letter cautioning him against continuing to play at grahams and intimating to him if he did so that measures would be taken which he would have reason to regret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course his lordship disregarded the threat he attended the club for several days more assiduously than before and continued to play until the end of the season in the beginning of july <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in september the satirist newspaper published a distinct charge of unfair play against lord de ros whilst the latter was at baden and he returned to england and commenced an action for libel against the newspaper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was charged with being in the habit of marking the cards the effect being to create a very slight and almost imperceptible indentation and to make a ridge or wave on the back so that a practised eye would be able on looking at the right place knowing where to expect a mark to discern whether the ace was there or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was also charged with cheating by reversing the cutthat is when the cards had come to him after having been cut by his adversary instead of putting the bottom card at the top keeping the bottom card at the bottom by some shuffling when he took up the two parcels of cards after the operation of cutting the pack by his righthand adversary he was always attacked with a hacking cough or what i may properly denominate especially from the result it produced a king cough because a king or an ace was invariably its effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cough always came on at the most convenient moment to distract the attention of the other players and was evidently indulged in for the purpose of abstracting their attention from the table and from the manoeuvre he was about to perform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however i never saw him slip the card and i never had cognizance of its execution but certain it was that the ace or the king which was at the bottom of the pack prior to the cut invariably found its way to the same position after the cut and hence was the turnup card <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with regard to the operation of dealing his lordship delivered the cards particularly slow examining every card minutely towards many curious facts came out during the trial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was mr brooke greville who admitted that he was a considerable winner at playhaving no hesitation in saying that he had won l in the course of years chiefly at whist that he had followed play as an occupation at grahams club <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lost however l at brighton in a considerable portion of it to lord de ros but this loss he made up in three or four years that is won l in that time and excepting that a captain j <end> <end> 
<start> <start> declared that he had won as much as l at a time having however to pay half to another partner his winnings might be l ayear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to play he said about or years ago and expecting that i should be asked the question i have looked into my accounts and find that i am about l better than as though i had not played <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a yearly average of l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had however lost about l during the previous year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this captain alexander was asked how many hours he played before dinner and he answeredfrom three to five hoursadding however that he had played all night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the counsel said why i generally make as good a dinner as i can get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the a small boiled chicken and a glass of lemonade perhaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i believe never and with increased earnestness of manner mind i deny the lemonade altogether i never take lemonade <end> <end>

<start> <start> general fitzpatrick being much in the same condition they agreed to raise a sum of money in order that they might keep a faro bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the members of the club made no objection and ere long they carried out their design <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as is generally the case the bank was a winner and lord robert bagged as his share of the proceeds l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he retired strange to say from the fetid atmosphere of play with the money in his pocket and never again gambled <end> <end>

<start> <start> it is dreadful to see not only there but almost in every house in the town what devastations are made by that destructive fury the spirit of play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fact stated by walpole to horace mann shows the character of the company at this establishmentthere is a man about town sir william burdett a man of very good family but most infamous character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short to give you his character at oncethere is a wager in the betbook at whites a ms <end> <end>

<start> <start> the play was mostly at hazard and faro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no member was to hold a faro bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professional gamblers who lived by dice and cards provided they were free from the imputation of cheating procured admission to whites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a great supperhouse and there was play before and after supper carried on to a late hour and to heavy amounts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at whites they betted on every possible thing as shown by the bettingbook of the establishmenton births deaths and marriages the length of a life the duration of a ministry a placemans prospect of a coronet the last scandal at ranelagh or madame cornelys or the shock of an earthquake <end> <end>

<start> <start> the more humane part of the company were for sending immediately for medical assistance but this was overruled since by the tenor of the bets he was to be left to himself and he died accordingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to walpolea person coming into the club on the morning of the earthquake in and hearing bets laid whether the shock was caused by an earthquake or the blowing up of powdermills went away in horror protesting they were such an impious set that he believed if the last trump were to sound they and again one of the youths at whites in has committed a murder and intends to repeat it <end> <end>

<start> <start> this once celebrated gaming house is now the wellington where the rattle of knives and forks has succeeded that of dice <end> <end>

<start> <start> others lost in proportion or out of proportion to their means but we leave it to less occupied moralists and better calculators to say how many ruined families went to make mr crockford a millionnairefor a millionnaire he was in the english sense of the term after making the largest possible allowance for bad debts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a vast sum perhaps half a million was sometimes due to him but as he won all his debtors were able to raise and easy credit was the most fatal of his lures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he retired in much as an indian chief retires from a hunting country when there is not game enough left for his tribe and the le wellington des joueurs was the name given to lord rivers in paris <end> <end>

<start> <start> crockford was originally a fishmonger keeping a shop near temple bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by embarking in this speculation he laid the foundation of the most colossal fortune that was ever made by play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was said there were persons of rank and station who had never paid their debts to crockford up to and that some of his creditors compounded with him for their gambling debts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his proprietorship had lasted or years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crockford himself was examined by the committee of the house of commons on the gaming houses but in spite of his assurance by the members that were indemnified witnesses in respect of pending actions he resolutely declined to tell the secrets of his prisonhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when asked whether a good deal of play was carried on at his club he saidthere may have been so but i do not feel myself at liberty to answer that questionto divulge the pursuits of private gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> situated as i was i do not feel myself at liberty to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not feel myself at liberty when asked to whom he had given up the house he fenced in like manner saying that he had given it up to a committee of about gentlemenconcerning which committee he professed to know absolutely nothinghe could not even say to whom he had given up the househe gave it up to the gentlemen of the club four years beforehe could not even say upon his word whether he signed any paper in giving it uphe believed he did not addingi said i grew too old and i could not continue in the club any longer and i wished to give up the club to the being asked do you think that a person is just as honourably bound to pay a debt which he loses upon a game of hazard as he would be to pay a bet which he loses on a horserace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crockford repliedi think most certainly he would honourably be bound to pay it.do you think that if the loser of a bet on a game at hazard had no charge to make of any kind of unfairness and he were to commence an action to recover that money back again he would lay himself open to a charge in the world of having acted dishonourably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old gamblers reply was most emphatic overwhelming indignanti should take all the pains i could to if this evidence was not satisfactory it was at any rate very characteristic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few interesting facts came out before the parliamentary committee on gaming in respecting crockfords <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was said that crockford gave up the business in because there were no more very high players visiting his house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a number of persons according to the admission of the honourable frederick byng who were born to very large the sums won on the turf were certainly larger than those won by players at crockfords a man might lose l in one or more bets to one or more persons but against this he might have won this is not very clearly put but the meaning is that much more money was lost at crockfords than on the turf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some years previously to crockfords retirement it is said that he found the debts so bad that he was obliged to leave off his custom of paying cheques and said he would cancel all previous debts but that in future gentlemen would have to pay with money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made them play for money instead of with counters in consequence of the large sums that were owing to him upon those counters <end> <end>

<start> <start> one morning between three and four oclock a gentleman came in much intoxicated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a great deal of money about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miller saidi did not mean to play but now ill set to with this fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miller scraped a little wax with his finger off one of the candles and put the dice together so that they came seven every way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seven was the main and he could not throw anything but seven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dispute arose and the persons at the table gave it in millers favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man said he had lost about l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the attorney had remarked on this at the time they would have broken his head or thrown him out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had often seen men pawn their watches and rings to miller and once a man actually pawned his coat and went away without it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when articles were offered to be pawned liston who was a partner in the concern saidi dont understand the value of even at the present day it is said that other articles besides valuables are left with the marker at billiards for a consideration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fine umbrella very little used was lately shown to me as having been sold for five shillings by a marker it probably cost twentyfive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miller said there was no disgrace in standing in the pillory for gaming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could spare l out of his coffers without missing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his gaming table was once broken up by a warrant from bow street when he said it was too good a thing to relinquish and he set up another one large enough for or persons to sit at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they played at it all night and on one or two occasions all the next day too so that miller said to witness on his return in the eveningsome of the people are still here who came last night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seen more than persons at a time there and they frequently offered halfacrown for a seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wine and suppers were furnished gratis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some looked over the backs of others and betted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mr smith the very man who had pawned his coat confirmed the above evidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miller was convicted and the judge lord kenyon made the following solemn observations before gaming is a crime of greater enormity and of more destructive consequences to society than many which the laws of the country have made capital <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the crime of stealing a sheep or picking a pocket of a handkerchief when placed in comparison with this crime traced through all its consequences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with regard to those in the higher walks of life experience tells us it often leads to selfmurder and duelling about gambling debts which terminate in the total ruin of families once opulent and reduce to beggary their innocent and helpless children and as for those in a lower sphere of life when they have lost their money they often betake themselves to housebreaking and the highway in order to replenish their with many other most excellent observations on the tendency of this selfish and avaricious vice he concluded by sentencing miller to a fine of l one years imprisonment and security for his good behaviour for seven years himself in l and two others in l each addingit appeared that you played with loaded dice <end> <end>

<start> <start> fortunate rise of a clubhouse waiter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a waitership at a club sometimes led to fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thomas rumbold originally a waiter at whites gaming club got an appointment in india and suddenly rose to be sir thomas and governor of madras <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his return with immense wealth a bill of pains and penalties was brought into the house by dundas with the view of stripping sir thomas of his illgotten gains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this bill was briskly pushed through the earlier stages suddenly the proceedings were arrested by adjournment and the measure fell to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rumour of the day attributed rumbolds escape to the corrupt assistance of rigby who in found himself by lord norths retirement deprived of his place in the pay office and called upon to refund a large amount of public moneys unaccounted for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this strait rigby was believed to have had recourse to rumbold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their acquaintance had commenced in earlier days when rigby was one of the boldest punters at whites and rumbold bowed to him for halfcrowns as waiter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rumbold is said to have given rigby a large sum of money on condition of the former being released from the impending pains and penalties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth of the report has been vehemently denied but the circumstances are suspicious <end> <end>

<start> <start> to the morning post of may at one of the gaming houses at the west end in one night property to the amount of l is said to have changed hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> account of a game at hazard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following account of a game at hazard was given by a young man who in the year was decoyed into one of the gambling houses in the city kept by one john morley who was convicted by the lord mayor in the penalty of l for keeping hazard but who it is stated left this country for ireland the moment proceedings were instituted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house in question was to all appearance devoted to the game of billiards and most of those who frequented it engaged merely in that game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the agency of professed gamesters who shared in the profits of the concern those who appeared to be proper objects of plunder were soon introduced to the hazard table which was kept in a retired and private part of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the evidence of the young man was to the following effecthe had been in morleys house the game of hazard was played in the front room on the second floor a door led into it from the landingplace and another from the public billiardroom which was the back room on the same floor both these doors were during the time of play kept barred and locked and never opened except to the voice of some person known to the master of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the play the door was seldom or never opened but before the play commenced there was an understanding given that proceedings were about to begin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the centre of the room was a large circular table over which a lamp was suspended and round the table the players sat in number generally from six to ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the play commenced by one of the players taking the dicebox with two dice in it two other dice were covered on the table and might be substituted for those in the box upon application to morley who acted as groom porter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the person who held the box was called the caster and he called a main that is he mentioned aloud any number on the dice from five to nine and throwing the dice on the table counted the number on the two dice as his chance the number which he called being the chance of his setter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the main is called the caster throws down his stake which any person present has the option of covering or as it is called setting by placing a similar sum on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance if the caster after being set call five the main and throws immediately four and one or three and two he nicks it that is wins his money at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he throws six and one five and two or four and three each of which two numbers makes seven he bets the odds which are three to two in his favourinasmuch as there are three ways of throwing seven and only two of throwing five and he continues throwing until either five or seven come off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the former he loses by the latter he wins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he calls seven the main and throws three and one or six and four the odds are two to one against himinasmuch as there are only three ways each of throwing the four and the ten and six wins throwing the seven that is three on each die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the caster wishes he calls a main and continues to do so till he loses which in the technical phraseology is throwing out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then passes the bow to the person next on the left hand who in like manner passes it to his neighbour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morley is remunerated for his table very handsomely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the caster throws in three mains successively he pays to morley what is called a box one of the pieces of the house with which the game is played <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prices are eighteenpence each and he gives them in exchange for notes and retakes them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the caster pays nothing unless he wins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the players generally leave off play at eleven or twelve oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on saturday there is most play as morley on that day always gives a dinner at four oclock immediately after which the play commences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on other days tea i confess i do not understand the above passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a number of young men most of whom were clerks were called to confirm the evidence as to the system but none of them appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a letter published in the times of july we read as the action against the keepers of a certain notorious hell which was noticed in the different journals as coming on is withdrawn or more properly speaking is compromised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus it will always be and the different hells still flourish with impunity to the enrichment of a few knaves and the ruin of many thousands till more effectual laws are framed to meet the evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they net thousands a night a few hundreds or even thousands can be well spared to smother a few actions and prosecutions which are very rarely instituted against them and never but by ruined men who are easily quieted by a small consideration which from recent judgments will not be withheld therefore we shall see recorded but very few convictions if any at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the head of these infamous establishments is one yclept fishmollgers hall which sacks more plunder than all the others put together though they consist of about a dozen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this place has been fitted up at an expense of l and is the most splendid house interiorly and exteriorly in all the neighbourhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is established as a bait for the fortunes of the great many of whom have already been severe sufferers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> invitations to dinner are sent to noblemen and gentlemen at which they are treated with every delicacy and the most intoxicating wines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after such liberal entertainment a visit to the french hazard table in the adjoining room is a matter of course when the consequences are easily divined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man thus allured to the den may determine not to lose more than the few pounds he has about him but in the intoxication of the moment and the delirium of play it frequently happens that notwithstanding the best resolves he borrows money on his cheques which are known to be good and are readily cashed to very considerable amounts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this manner l l l or more have been often swept away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they left king street about three years ago when in conjunction with t a man who a few years ago took the benefit of the act and subsequently took one or two hells in pall mall but has amassed full l of plunder and a who has l of plunder they opened a clubhouse in piccadilly with a french hazard bank of l when in a short time they divided between the fourafter all their heavy expenses were coveredupwards of l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in proportion to the extent of the bank and the progress in the gaming trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the minor gaming houses the players assembled in parties of from to persons who probably brought on an average each night from one to twenty shillings to play with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the money was lost the losers fell off if they could not borrow or beg more and this went on sometimes in the winter season for to hours in succession so that from to persons might be calculated to visit one gaming table in the course of a night and it not unfrequently happened that ultimately all the money brought to the table got into the hands of one or two of the most fortunate adventurers save that which was paid to the table for boxhandsthat is when a player won three times in succession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at these establishments the price of a box varied from one shilling to halfacrown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every man thus engaged was destined to become either a more finished and mischievous gambler or to appear at the bar of the old bailey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the successful players by degrees improved their external appearance and obtained admittance into houses of higher play where two shillings and sixpence or three shillings and fourpence was demanded for the boxhand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if success attended them in the first step of advancement they next got initiated into better houses and associated with gamblers of a higher grade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the year the gaming houses were kept open all day the dice were scarcely ever idle day or night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from sunday to sunday all the year round persons were to be found in these places losing their money and wasting away their very bodies by the consuming anxiety consequent on their position at the hazard or roulette table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> following facts came out in evidence before the committee of the house of commons in  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down to that year there were no less than gaming houses in st jamess and st georges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the play was higher in old times but not so general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the increase of gambling houses was entirely the offspring of crockfords <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such was the opinion of the honourable frederick byng before the committee who added that the facility to everybody to gamble at crockfords led to the establishment of other gambling houses fitted up in a superior style and attractive to gentlemen who never would have thought of going previously in the clubs the gambling was confined to a very high rate and to a very few people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abovenamed witness said he could have named all the gamblers in his early days at the clubs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no person coming into a room where hazard was carried on would have been permitted to play for a small sum and therefore the same gentleman remembered the time when gambling tables were kept in private houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a fact that most of those who played very high were pretty crockford increased gambling everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> persons of the middling classes butchers and gentlemans servants went to the these places held out inducements to robbery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a servant or shopman could scrape together l or l he had by the agency of the keepers of these houses the opportunity of lending out desperation at gaming houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most particular inspection was made of the players person by the gaming house keepers spies and even his dress was strictly observed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was obliged before entering the saloon to deposit his great coat and cane which might perchance afford the introduction of some weapon and the elegance of the covering did not save him from the humiliation of having it taken from him at the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the attempts which were sometimes made on the lives of the bankers led to these precautionslike the indignities which are practised only in prisons for the security of the unhappy inmates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is certain that gamesters reduced to desperation and on the eve of committing suicide have conveyed into these places infernal machines with an intention of destroying at once their cruel plunderers and themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in doings in london a work published as lately as the year we find under this startling title a strange story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a scandalous scene of violence which often happens at these places but seldom becomes publicly known on account of the disgrace attending exposures occurred lately at a low hell in king street st jamess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gentleman who had lost considerable sums of money at various times announced his full determination never to come to a place of the sort again with money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his visits therefore were no longer wanted and so orders were given to the porters not to admit him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about two oclock on a subsequent night which happened to be saturday he sought admittance and was refused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a warm altercation ensued in the passage between him and the porters which brought down some of the proprietors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of thema powerful mana bankrupt butcherstruck him a tremendous blow which broke the bridge of his nose covered his face with blood and knocked him down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on getting up he was knocked down again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he arose once more and instantly received another blow which would have laid him upon his back but one of the porters by this time had got behind him and as he was falling struck him at the back of his head which sent him upon his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the watch had now arrived into whose hands the keeper of the hell and the porter were given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the watchhouse they were ordered to find bail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gentleman was then about quitting when he was suddenly called back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain little lawyer who alternately prosecutes and defends keepers of gaming houses was sent for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he whispered to the ex butcher to charge the gentleman with stealing his handkerchief and hat which it was alleged had been lost in the affray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though nothing was found upon the gentleman who desired to be searched this preposterous and groundless charge was taken and the hellites admitted to bail but the gentleman who had been so cruelly beaten being charged with a felony on purpose to cause his detention and the power held by magistrates to take bail in doubtful cases not extending to nightconstables he was locked up below with two wretches who had stolen lead and five disorderlieshis face a mass of blood and bruisesand there detained till monday morning in a most pitiable condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the magistrate before whom the party appeared on that day understanding that the affair took place at a gaming house dismissed both complaints leaving the parties to their remedy at gaffing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gaffing is or was one of the ten thousand modes of swindling practised in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> formerly it was a game in very great vogue among the macers who congregated nightly at the flash houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these is described as followsthis gaffer laughed a great deal and whistled moores melodies and extracted music from a deal table with his elbow and wrist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he hid a halfpenny and a flat cried head for l a tail was sure to turn up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of his modes of commanding the turnup was this he had a halfpenny with two heads and a halfpenny with two tails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he gaffed he contrived to have both halfpence under his hand and long practice enabled him to catch up in the wrinkles or muscles of it the halfpenny which it was his interest to conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if tail was called a head appeared and the tail halfpenny ran down his wrist with astonishing fidelity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this ingenious fellow often won or sovereigns a night by gaffing but the landlord and other men who were privy to the robbery and pitched the baby card that is encouraged the loser by sham betting always came in for the regulars that is their share of the plunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gaffer contrived to bilk all the turnpikes in the kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in going to a fight or to a racecourse when he reached a turnpike he held a shilling between his fingers and said to the gatekeeperhere catch and made a movement of the hand towards the man who endeavoured to catch what he saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shilling however by a backward jerk ran down the sleeve of the coat as if it had life in it and the gatekeeper turned round to look in the dust when the tall gaffer drove on sayingkeep a young fellow who previously was a marker at a billiardtable and who had the appearance of a soft inexperienced countrylad was another great hand at gaffing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a strong adhesive power in his hand and such exquisite sensibility about it that he could ascertain by dropping his palm even upon a wornout halfpenny or shilling what side was turned up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed so perfect a master was he of the science that breslaw could never have done more upon cards than he could do with a pair of grays gaffingcoins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wellknown macer who was celebrated for slipping an old gentleman a long card into the pack and was the inheritor by birth of all the propensities of this description although the inheritance was equally divided between his brother and himself got hold of a young fellow who had l in his pocket and introduced him to one of the cockandhen houses near drury lane theatre wellprimed with wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gaffing began and the billiardmarker before described was pitched upon to do the stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the macer pitched the baby card and of course lost as well as the unfortunate victim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had borrowed l of the landlord who was to come in for the regulars but when all was over the billiardmarker refused to make any division of the spoil or even to return the l which had been lost to him in bearing up the cull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlord pressed his demand upon the macer who in fact was privately reimbursed by the marker but he was coolly told that he ought not to allow such improper practices in his house and that the sum was not recoverable the transaction being illegal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how these spurious coins are procured is a question but i am assured that they are still in use and often made to do service at publichouses and other places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a mode of gambling very much in vogue at the present time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is often played at publichouses among parties to decide who is to pay the reckoning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each party turns down a halfpenny and on uncovering it the matter is decided as in heads or tails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course this expeditious method is also used in gambling for money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not long ago a retired tradesman happening to be in a publichouse where such things were connived at allowed himself to be induced to play at tommy dodd with two low sharpers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they soon eased him of all the cash he had about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a bright idea however occurred to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop a bit he said i must have my revenge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just wait till i go home for more money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sharpers were rejoiced at the idea and rubbed their hands with delight whilst the tradesman went as they felt sure only to bring more money into their till <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man made all haste for he was determined to have his revenge and soon returned with a large bag of money which he clinked on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he first pulled out some coppers telling them to choose from the lot the coins they would play with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they assented although they did not seem much to like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now said the tradesman the game proceeded with alternate success on both sides but the tradesman went on doubling the stakes every time whether he lost or won and of course at length completely broke their bank and went off with their money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gambling which was carried on in the private rooms of the wine and oyster houses about thirty years ago and perhaps later was just such as that which had so long flourished in the low vicinity of st jamess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed the constant frequenters of the former had attained the most profound knowledge of the art of robbing at the west end gaming houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blacklegs visited the saloons every night in order to pick up new acquaintances among the young and inexperienced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were polite welldressed gentlemanlike persons and if they could trace anything soft in the countenance of a new visitor their wits went to work at once to establish an acquaintance with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wine was set a going and cards were proposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the master of the concern soon provided a room and play advanced accompanied by the certainty of loss to the unfortunate stranger <end> <end>

<start> <start> it was evidently intended to expose some doings in high places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctrine of probabilities applied to gambling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a distinction must be made between games of skill and games of chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the former require application attention and a certain degree of ability to insure success in them while the latter are devoid of all that is rational and are equally within the reach of the highest and lowest capacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be successful in throwing the dice is one of the most fickle achievements of fickle fortune and therefore the principal game played with them is very properly and emphatically called hazard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it requires indeed some exertion of the mental powers of memory at least and a turn for such diversions to play well many games at cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless it is often found that those who do so give no further proofs of superior memory and judgment whilst persons of superior memory and judgment not unfrequently fail egregiously at the cardtable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gamester of skill in games of skill may at first sight seem to have more advantage than the gamester of chance in games of chance and while cards are played merely as an amusement there is no doubt that a recreation is more rational when it requires some degree of skill than one like dice totally devoid of all meaning whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when the pleasure becomes a business and a matter of mere gain there is more innocence perhaps in a perfect equality of antagonistswhich games of chance fairly played always securethan where one party is likely to be an overmatch for the other by his superior knowledge or ability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless even games of chance may be artfully managed and the most apparently casual throw of the dice be made subservient to the purposes of chicanery and fraud as will be shown in the sequel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the matter of skill and chance the nature of cards is mixed most games having in them both elements of interestsince the success of the player must depend as much on the chance of the deal as on his skill in playing the game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but even the chance of the deal is liable to be perverted by all the tricks of shuffling and cuttingnot to mention how the honourable player may be deceived in a thousand ways by the craft of the sharper during the playing of the cards themselves consequently professed gamblers of all denominations whether their games be of apparent skill or mere chance may be confounded together or considered in the same category as being equally meritorious and equally infamous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under the name of the doctrine of chances or probabilities a very learned sciencemuch in vogue when lotteries were prevalenthas been applied to gambling purposes and in spite of the obvious abstruseness of the science it is not impossible to give the general reader an idea of its processes and conclusions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the probability of an event is greater or less according to the number of chances by which it may happen compared with the whole number of chances by which it may either happen or fail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore if we constitute a fraction whereof the numerator be the number of chances whereby an event may happen and the denominator the number of all the chances whereby it may either happen or fail that fraction will be a proper designation of the probability of happening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus if an event has chances to happen and to fail then the fraction will fairly represent the probability of its happening and may be taken to be the measure of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same may be said of the probability of failing which will likewise be measured by a fraction whose numerator is the number of chances whereby it may fail and the denominator the whole number of chances both for its happening and failing thus the probability of the failing of that event which has chances to fail and to happen will be measured by the fraction  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fractions which represent the probabilities of happening and failing being added together their sum will always be equal to unity since the sum of their numerators will be equal to their common denominator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it being a certainty that an event will either happen or fail it follows that certainty which may be conceived under the notion of an infinitely great degree of probability is fitly represented by unity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these things will be easily apprehended if it be considered that the word probability includes a double idea first of the number of chances whereby an event may happen secondly of the number of chances whereby it may either happen or fail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i say that i have three chances to win any sum of money it is impossible from the bare assertion to judge whether i am likely to obtain it but if i add that the number of chances either to obtain it or miss it is five in all from this will ensue a comparison between the chances that are for and against me whereby a true judgment will be formed of my probability of success whence it necessarily follows that it is the comparative magnitude of the number of chances to happen in respect of the whole number of chances either to happen or to fail which is the true measure of probability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to find the probability of throwing an ace in two throws with a single die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the probability of throwing an ace the first time is whereof is the first part of the probability required <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the ace be missed the first time still it may be thrown on the second but the probability of missing it the first time is and the probability of throwing it the second time is therefore the probability of missing it the first time and throwing it the second is x and this is the second part of the probability required and therefore the probability required is in all  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this case is analogous a question commonly proposed about throwing with two dice either six or seven in two throws which will be easily solved provided it be known that seven has chances to come up and six chances and that the whole number of chances in two dice is for the number of chances for throwing six or seven it follows that the probability of throwing either chance the first time is but if both are missed the first time still either may be thrown the second time but the probability of missing both the first time is and the probability of throwing either of them on the second is therefore the probability of missing both of them the first time and throwing either of them the second time is x and therefore the probability required is and the probability of the contrary is  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the many mistakes that are committed about chances one of the most common and least suspected was that which related to lotteries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thussupposing a lottery wherein the proportion of the blanks to the prizes was as five to one it was very natural to conclude that therefore five tickets were requisite for the chance of a prize and yet it is demonstrable that four tickets were more than sufficient for that purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in like manner supposing a lottery in which the proportion of the blanks to the prize is as thirtynine to one as was the lottery of it may be proved that in twentyeight tickets a prize is as likely to be taken as not which though it may contradict the common notions is nevertheless grounded upon infallible demonstrations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the play of the royal oak was in use some persons who lost considerably by it had their losses chiefly occasioned by an argument of which they could not perceive the fallacy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the odds against any particular point of the ball were one and thirty to one which entitled the adventurers in case they were winners to have thirtytwo stakes returned including their own instead of which as they had but twentyeight it was very plain that on the single account of the disadvantage of the play they lost oneeighth part of all the money played for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the master of the ball maintained that they had no reason to complain since he would undertake that any particular point of the ball should come up in two and twenty throws of this he would offer to lay a wager and actually laid it when required <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the seeming contradiction between the odds of one and thirty to one and twentytwo throws for any chance to come up so perplexed the adventurers that they began to think the advantage was on their side and so they went on playing and continued to lose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctrine of chances tends to explode the longstanding superstition that there is in play such a thing as luck good or bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if by saying that a man has good luck nothing more were meant than that he has been generally a gainer at play the expression might be allowed as very proper in a short way of speaking but if the word good luck be understood to signify a certain predominant quality so inherent in a man that he must win whenever he plays or at least win oftener than lose it may be denied that there is any such thing in nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the asserters of luck maintain that sometimes they have been very lucky and at other times they have had a prodigious run of bad luck against them which whilst it continued obliged them to be very cautious in engaging with the fortunate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they asked how they could lose fifteen games running if bad luck had not prevailed strangely against them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is quite certain that although the odds against losing so many times together be very great namely to yet the possibility of it is not destroyed by the greatness of the odds there being one chance in that it may so happen therefore it follows that the succession of lost games was still possible without the intervention of bad luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the accident of losing fifteen games is no more to be imputed to bad luck than the winning with one single ticket the highest prize in a lottery of tickets is to be imputed to good luck since the chances in both cases are perfectly equal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if it be said that luck has been concerned in the latter case the answer will be easy for let us suppose luck not existing or at least let us suppose its influence to be suspendedyet the highest prize must fall into some hand or other not as luck for by the hypothesis that has been laid aside but from the mere necessity of its falling somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the many curious results of these inquiries according to the doctrine of chances is the prodigious advantage which the repetition of odds will amount to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus supposing i play with an adversary who allows me the odds of to and agrees with me to play till stakes are won or lost on either side on condition that i give him an equivalent for the gain i am entitled to by the advantage of my oddsthe question is what i am to give him supposing we play at a guinea a stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answer is guineas and above shillings which will seem almost incredible considering the smallness of the odds to  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now let the odds be in any proportion and let the number of stakes played for be never so great yet one general conclusion will include all the possible cases and the application of it to the guinea was worth s <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the work quoted was written <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the possible combinations of cards in a hand as dealt out by chance are truly wonderful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has been established by calculation that a player at whist may hold above thousand millions of various hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that continually varied at deals per evening for evenings or hands per annum he might be above millions of years before he would have the same hand again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chance is equal in dealing cards that every hand will have seven trumps in two deals or seven trumps between two partners and also four court cards in every deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is also certain on an average of hands that nothing can be more superstitious and absurd than the prevailing notions about luck or illluck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four persons constantly playing at whist during a long voyage were frequently winners and losers to a large amount but as frequently at quits and at the end of the voyage after the last game one of them was minus only one franc <end> <end>

<start> <start> the chances of a game are generally inversely as the number got by each or as the number to be got to complete each game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chances against holding seven trumps are to against six it is to against five to and against four nearly to  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is to against holding any two particular cards <end> <end>

<start> <start> it is to against throwing any two desired numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is to against throwing a single number with either of the dice so as to hit a blot and enter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> against hitting with the amount of two dice the chances against and are to against are to against are to and against sixes to  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the probabilities of throwing required totals with two dice depend on the number of ways in which the totals can be made up by the dice or can only be made up one way each and therefore the chance is but may be made up two ways or three ways or  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chance of doublets is the chance of particular doublets  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the method was largely applied to lotteries cockfighting and horseracing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be asked how it is possible to calculate the odds in horseracing when perhaps the jockeys in a great measure know before they start which is to win <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in answer to this a question may be proposedsuppose i toss up a halfpenny and you are to guess whether it will be head or tailmust it not be allowed that you have an equal chance to win as to lose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or if i hide a halfpenny under a hat and i know what it is have you not as good a chance to guess right as if it were tossed up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my knowing it to be head can be no hindrance to you as long as you have liberty of choosing either head or tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of this reasoning there are people who build so much upon their own opinion that should their favourite horse happen to be beaten they will have it to be owing to some fraud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened at malden in essex in the year that three horses and no more than three started for a l plate and they were all three distanced the first heat according to the common rules in horseracing without any quibble or equivocation and the following was the solutionthe first horse ran on the inside of the post the second wanted weight and the third fell cheanys horseracing book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in horseracing the expectation of an event is considered as the present value or worth of whatsoever sum or thing is depending on the happening of that event <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore if the expectation on an event be divided by the value of the thing expected on the happening of that event the quotient will be the probability of happening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose two horses a and b to start for l and there are even bets on both sides it is evident that the present value or worth of each of their expectations will be l and the probabilities or  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if they had agreed to divide the prize between them according as the bets should be at the time of their starting they would each of them be entitled to l but if a had been thought so much superior to b that the bets had been to in his favour then the real value of as expectation would have been l and that of bs only l and their several probabilities and  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us suppose three horses to start for a sweepstake namely a b and c and that the odds are to a against b and to b against cwhat are the oddsa against c and the field against a <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answer to a against c and to or to the field against a <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for as expectation is bs expectation is cs expectation is but if the bets had been to a against b and even money b against c then the odds would have been to the field against a as shown in the following scheme a b c but as this is the basis upon which all the rest depends another example or two may be required to make it as plain as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose the same three as before and the common bets to a against b to or gold to silver b against c we must state it thus guineas to a against b and guineas to l b against c which being reduced into shillings as expectation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by which it will be to the field against a something more than to  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if we compare this with the last example we may conclude it to be right for if it had been to then it would have been to exactly as in the last example <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as some persons may be at a loss to know why the numbers and are selected it is requisite to show the same by means of the sliding rule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> set upon the line a to upon the slider b and then look along till you see two whole numbers which stand exactly one against the other or as near as you can come which in this case you find to be on a standing against on the slider b very nearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as and are in the lowest terms there are no less numbers in the same proportion as to and being the nearest but not quite exact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are four horses to start for a sweepstake namely a b c d and they are supposed to be as equally matched as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now mr sly has laid guineas a against c and also guineas a against d <end> <end> 
<start> <start> likewise mr rider has laid guineas a against c and also guineas b against d <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after which mr dice laid mr sly guineas to that he will not win both his bets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> secondly he laid mr rider guineas to that he will not win both his bets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now we wish to know what mr dices advantage or disadvantage is in laying these two lastmentioned wagers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first the probability of mr slys winning both his bets is of guineas and mr dices expectation is of guineas or l s <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which being deducted from his own stake guineas there remains s <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which is his disadvantage in that bet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> secondly mr riders expectation of winning his two bets is and therefore mr dices expectation of the guineas is or l s <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from which deduct guineas his own stake and there remains s <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his advantage in this betwhich being deducted from s <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his disadvantage in the other there remains s d <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his disadvantage in paying both these bets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these examples may suffice to show the working of the system regular tables exist adapted to all cases and there can be no doubt that those who have realized large fortunes by horseracing managed to do so by uniformly acting on some such principles as well as by availing themselves of such valuable information as may be secured before events come off by those who make horseracing their business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same system was applied and with still greater precision to cockfighting to lotteries raffles backgammon cribbage put all fours and whist showing all the chances of holding any particular card or cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus it is to that your partner has not one certain card to that he has not two certain cards to that he has not one of them only and to or to that he has one or boththat is when two cards are in question <end> <end>

<start> <start> such is a general sketch of the large subject included under the term of the calculation of probabilities which comprises not only the chances of games of hazard insurances lotteries c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but also the determination of future events from observations made relative to events of the same nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this subject of inquiry dates only from the th century and occupied the minds of pascal huygens fermot bernouilli laplace fourier lacroix poisson de moivre and in more modern times cournot quetelet and professor de morgan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the matter of betting or in estimating the odds in betting of course an acquaintance with the method must be of some service and there can be no doubt that professional gamesters endeavoured to master the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roberthoudin in his amusing work les tricheries des grecs devoilees has propounded some gaming axioms which are at least curious and interesting they are presented as those of a professional gambler and cheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every game of chance presents two kinds of chances which are very distinctnamely those relating to the person interested that is the player and those inherent in the combinations of in the former there is what must be called for the want of a better name good luck or bad luck that is some mysterious cause which at times gives the play a run of good or bad luck in the latter there is the entire doctrine of probabilities aforesaid which according to m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> houdins gaming hero may be  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if chance can bring into the game all possible combinations there are nevertheless certain limits at which it seems to stop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such for instance as a certain number turning up ten times in succession at roulette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is possible but it has nevertheless a most remarkable fact is on record <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a mr ogden betted guineas to one guinea that calling seven as the main the caster would not throw that number ten times successively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the caster threw seven nine times following <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon mr ogden offered him guineas to be off the betwhich he refused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the caster took the box again and threw nineand so mr ogden won his guinea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this case there seems to have been no suspicion whatever of unfair dice being used <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a game of chance the oftener the same combination has occurred in succession the nearer we are to the certainty that it will not recur at the next cast or turn up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the most elementary of the theories on probabilities it is termed the hence according to this great authority a player must come to the table not only in luck but he must not risk his money excepting at the instant prescribed by the rules of the maturity founded on this theory we have the following precepts for  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gaming prefer roulette because it presents several ways of staking your moneywhich permits the study of several <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pair impair passe manque and the numbers of the roulette besides the different combinations of position and maturities together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a player should approach the gaming table perfectly calm and cooljust as a merchant or tradesman in treaty about any affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he gets into a passion it is all over with prudence all over with good luckfor the demon of bad luck invariably pursues a passionate player <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every man who finds a pleasure in playing runs the risk of losing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a prudent player before undertaking anything should put himself to the test to discover if he is in veinin luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in i remember a curious incident in my childhood which seems much to the point of this axiom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a magnificent gold watch and chain were given towards the building of a church and my mother took three chances which were at a very high figure the watch and chain being valued at more than l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these chances was entered in my name one in my brothers and the third in my mothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to throw for her as well as myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my brother threw an insignificant figure for myself i did the same but oddly enough i refused to throw for my mother on finding that i had lost my chance saying that i should wait a little longer rather a curious piece of prudence for a child of thirteen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the raffle was with three dice the majority of the chances had been thrown and was the highest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after declining to throw i went on throwing the dice for amusement and was surprised to find that every throw was better than the one i had in the raffle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thereupon saidnow ill throw for mamma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i threw thirtysix which won the watch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother had been a large subscriber to the building of the church and the priest said that my winning the watch for her was quite providential <end> <end> 
<start> <start> houdins authority however it seems that i only got into veinbut how i came to pause and defer throwing the last chance has always puzzled me respecting this incident of my childhood which made too great an impression ever to be effaced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are persons who are constantly pursued by bad luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember that fortune does not like people to be overjoyed at her favours and that she prepares bitter deceptions for the such are the chief axioms of a most experienced gamester and m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before risking your money at play you must deeply study your vein and the different probabilities of the gametermed m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roberthoudin got all this precious information from a gamester named raymond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appears that the first meeting between him and this man was at a subscriptionball where the sharper managed to fleece him and others to a considerable amount contriving a dexterous escape when detected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> houdin afterwards fell in with him at spa where he found him in the greatest poverty and lent him a small sumto practise his grand theories as just explainedbut which he lostwhereupon houdin advised him to take up a less dangerous occupation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then appears to have revealed to houdin the entertaining particulars which form the bulk of his book so dramatically written <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a year afterwards houdin unexpectedly fell in with him again but this time the fellow was transformed into what he called a demi millionnaire having succeeded to a large fortune by the death of his brother who died intestate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to houdin the following was the mans declaration at the auspicious meeting i have said raymond completely renounced gaming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am rich enough and care no longer for fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet he added proudly if i now cared for the thing how i could break those bloated banks in their pride and what a glorious vengeance i could take of bad luck and its inflexible agents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my heart is too full of my happiness to allow the smallest place for the a very proper speech unquestionably and rendered still more edifying by m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> houdins assurance that raymond at his death three years after bequeathed the whole of his fortune to various charitable institutions at paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with regard to the mans gaming theories however it may be just as well to consider the fact that very many clever people after contriving fine systems and schemes for ruining gaming banks have as m <end> <end>

<start> <start> they will solace themselves no doubt on being told that they are pursuing a diversion of the highest antiquity and which has been handed down through all civilized as well as barbarous nations to our own times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tried hilarius breathlessly tears of pure pity in his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the lord cared for me even as he cared for the prophet jonas and sent a ship that his message might not be hindered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shipmen were kindly folk but we were driven out of our course by a great wind and at last came ashore in lincolnshire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have come south thus far by the aid of christian men but time presses and now lo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou art here to guide me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my father said poor hilarius seeing yet another barrier in the way of his desires tis a limner i would be and i am from westminster not london and then there is prior stephens letter thou shalt be a limner my son the lord hath revealed it to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last night the vision came again and a voice cried speed for a son of christ waits by the way to guide thy steps and lo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou art here waiting by the way as the voice said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now son an thou wilt come thou shalt take thy letter to wymondham tis a cell of this abbey for there is brother andreas from overseas who hath wondrous skill with the brush he will teach thee for thou shalt say to him that brother amadeus sent thee who is now as bartimeus waiting for the light of the lord but first thou shalt set me in that village of bungay where my mother dwelleth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius listened gazing awestruck at the withered eyes that vainly questioned his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had forgotten plague death flagellants in this absorbing tale of the man of god who was even as one of the blessed martyrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how should he hilarius gainsay one with a vision from the lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i obey my father he cried joyously taking the friars hand and they two passed swiftly down the road their faces to the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a bitterly cold night and st agnes eve the snow fell heavily caught into whirling eddies by the keen north wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius and the friar crossing an empty waste of bleak unprotected heath met the full force of the blast and each moment the snow grew denser the darkness more complete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they struggled on breathless beaten exhausted and lost hilarius leading the friar by one hand held the other across his bent head to shield himself from the buffets of the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can no more father he said the snow is as a wall there is naught to see or to hear i deem we are far from our right way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his voice was very weak and he caught at the friar for support <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will pray the lord my son that he open thine eyes even as he opened the eyes of the prophets servant in the besieged city so shalt thou see a host of angels encompassing us for we are about the lords business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay my father said hilarius feebly i see no angels and i perish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tottered and would have fallen but the friar caught him in his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment he stood irresolute the boy on his breast then flung away his staff and lifted him to his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with unerring confident step he went forward through the snow a white figure bearing a white burden in a white world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all at once the wind dropped the blinding shower ceased and hilarius rested is it thou my father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is i my son but angels are on either hand and go before to guide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the snow hath ceased canst thou walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he set hilarius gently on his feet and lo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy gave a cry and forgetting his companions darkness pointed to the left where lay a snowclad village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a miracle a miracle my father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a miracle i faith my son the lord hath given guidance to the blind as he promised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went by the white way under the stars and hilarius was full of awe and comfort because of the angels of god which attended on a poor friar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the village hostel they found rough but friendly entertainment and several guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dried themselves at a roaring fire and hilarius made a hearty meal the friar would eat nothing save a morsel of bread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a messenger was there a short stout man with stubbly beard bright black eyes like beads and a high colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was riding with despatches from the king to the abbat at bury and had fearful tales to tell of the plague how in london they piled the dead in trenches while many who escaped the pest died of want and cold it was a city of the dead rather than the living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one great lord travelling posthaste from westminster had been found by his servants to have the disorder and they fled leaving him by the wayside to perish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis a grievous shame so to desert a sick master he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay lad said a chapman in the corner but a man loves his own skin best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay ay said a fat ruddyfaced miller overtaken by the storm on his way to a neighbouring village a mans own skin before all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fill your belly first and your neighbours afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay let live chimed in mine host bustling in with a stoop of cider for the chapman but by the rood tis cruel work when two lone women are murdered for a bit of mouldy bacon and a lump of bread for ise warrant tis a long day sin they had more than that at best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay where but here on the bruary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the women were found wednesday sennight by the herd as he went folding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they lay on the floor in their blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in westminster by some miracle he had been spared the sight of violent death ay or of death in any form and had seen nothing worse than a rogue in the stocks for which sight he had thanked heaven piously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis the fault of the rich said a voice and hilarius saw to his surprise that there was a second friar in the room a tall bulletheaded man with a heavy obstinate jaw ornamented with a scanty fringe of black hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rich grow fat and the poor starve he went on tis hunger makes a man kill his brother for a mouthful of mouldy bacon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay said the miller there was no need to kill father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man could have taken the meat from two lone women and left them their lives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why take from folk as poor as themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let them rob the rich an they must rob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay said the friar rob the rich say you take their own say i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god did not make this world that one man should be over full and another go empty nor is it religion that the monks should live on the fat o the land and grind the faces of the poor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many manors think you has the abbat of st edmunds and how many on his land lack bread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius listened scarlet with indignation a flood of wrathful defence pent at his lips for the blind friar laid a restraining hand on his sleeve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mine host scratched his head doubtfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the teaching was seditious and made a man liable to stocks and pillory but it tickled the ears of the common folk and twas ill to quarrel with the mendicants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> help came to him in his perplexity a loud knocking on the barred door made the guests within start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis eight o the clock said the miller affrighted for he had a heavy purse on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let them knock and cool their hot heads said the seditious friar composedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a mans voice threatened without <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is this a night to keep a man without <end> <end> 
<start> <start> open open or by the mass thou shalt smart for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mine host shook his head fearfully and his fat cheeks trembled he moved slowly and unwillingly to the door and took down the stout wooden bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it swung back the door flew open and a man burst in at sight of whom mine host turned yet paler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> food and drink said the newcomer sharply flinging himself on a bench by the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius thought he had never seen so strange a fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hair was close cropped ay and his ears also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes were very small and near together his nose a shapeless lump his lip drawn up showed two ratlike teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silence fell on the company and the chapman who had been searching amongst his goods for something wherewith to pay his hospitality was hastily putting them back when the man looking up caught sight of a bundle of oaten pipes among the miscellaneous wares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he plucked one to him and in a moment the air was full of tender liquid notes a thrushs roundelay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a blackbird called and his mate answered a cuckoo cried the springsong a linnet mourned with lifting cadence a nightingale poured forth her deathless love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mine host came in with a dish piled high and a stoop of mead the man threw the pipe from him with a rough oath and fell to ravenously on the victuals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held his head low and ate brutishly amid dead silence then he looked up and cursed at them for their sorry mood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hugh pipes and never a word of thanks nor a jest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damn you all for dull dogs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blind friar rose and fixed his withered eyes on the mans dreadful face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> piping hugh of mildenhall he said and at his voice the man leapt to his feet and thrust his arm out as if for protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> piping hugh of mildenhall said the friar again i have a message for thee from the lord god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cried thee damned in my own name once when thou didst take my little sister to shame and death now i cry thee thrice damned in the name of the lord for the cup of thine iniquity is full and thy hands red with blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> man hath branded thee now god will set his mark on thee and all men shall see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plague will come and come swiftly but it shall not touch thee many shall die in their sins thou shalt live on with thine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a brute thou art and with brutes thou shalt herd thou shalt howl as a ravening wolf and as such men shall hunt thee from their doors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou shalt seek death even as cain sought and found it not because of the mark of the lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou art damned thrice damned thy speech shall go from thee thy sight fail thee thy mind be darkened thou art given over to the evil one and he shall torment thee with remembrance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was dead silence then with a long shrill howl the man tore open the door dashed from the house and fled a black blotch upon the whiteness of the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the guests huddled together aghast and no man moved until hilarius full of pride at his friars powers stepped forward to close the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was too late it swung to with a loud crash like the sound of doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the friar sank back composedly on the bench and the company began in silence to make preparation for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when all was ordered hilarius bade the friar come and he rose at the lads voice and touch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he crossed to where the others stood apart eyeing him fearfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laid his hand on the millers breast and said in a clear low voice thou wilt die brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laid his hand on the messengers breast thou wilt die brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laid his hand on the chapmans breast thou wilt die brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laid his hand on mine hosts breast thou wilt die brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he came to the other friar who stood at a little distance his face dark with anger and fear and laid his hand on his breast thou wilt live my brother and repent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a far cry from st albans to bungay which village of the good ford lies somewhat southeast of norwich five leagues distant and the journey is doubled in the winter time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius and the friar were long on the road for januarys turbulent mood had imprisoned them many days and early february had proved little kinder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had companied with folk light women and brutal men but for the most part coarse word and foul jest were hushed in the presence of the blind friar and the lad with the wondering eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in every village the friar preached and called on men to repent and be saved for deaths shadow was already upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> folk wondered and gaped the plague was still only a name ten leagues east of london but many repented and confessed and made restitution though some heard with idle ears remembering the prophecy of brother robert who had come with the same message half a mans lifetime before and that no evil had followed his preaching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last st matthias eve saw hilarius and the friar at st edmunds abbey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were many guests for the convents hospitality that night and as hilarius entered the hall of the guesthouse a brother had charged himself with the care of the friar he heard the sound of the vielle and a rich voice which sang in good round english against the fashion of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the minstrel springing to his feet he caught hilarius to him and embraced him heartily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why lad not back in thy monastery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay but i made sure the plague would send thee flying home and instead i find thee strayed farther afield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then seeing the injured faces round him for that the song was not ended he drew hilarius to the bench beside him and took up his vielle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be still now lad til i have finished my ditty for this worshipful company then ant please thee to tell it i will hear thy tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the guests who had looked somewhat sour at the interruption unpursed their lips and settled to listen as the minstrel took up the fair maid came to the old oak tree sun and wind and a bird on the bough the throstle he sang merrily merrily merrily but the fair maid wept for sad was she sad was she her sweet knight oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lay dead in the cold cold ground moon and stars and rain on the hill in his side and breast were bloody wounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woe woe is me for the fair ladye and the poor knight he the poor knight ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the maiden sat her down to die cold cold earth on her lovers breast and the little birds rang mournfully and the moonshine kissed her tenderly and the stars looked down right pityingly on the poor fair maid and the poor cold knight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah misery dear misery sweet misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this mournful song was no sooner ended than supper was served and the company proved themselves good trenchermen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius caught sight of the seditious friar making short work of the convents victuals and marvelled to see him in a place to which he had given so evil a name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin was unfeignedly glad to see the lad and listened intently to his tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he nodded his head as hilarius related how the friar he companied with preached in each village that men should repent ere the scourge of god fell upon them but there is naught of it as yet said the lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay nay it is like a thief in the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day it is not and then the next men sicken and fall like blasted wheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard a bruit of london that it was but a heap of graves nay one grave rather for they flung the bodies into a great trench there was no time to do otherwise black death is swift with his stroke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then hilarius told of piping hugh and the friars deathwords to the guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin swore a round oath and slapped his thigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now know i that thy friar is a proper man an he has set a curse on piping hugh of mildenhall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a foulmouthed knave with many a black deed to his name and blood on his hands if men say truth and yet there was never a bird that would not come at his call and i never heard tell that he harmed one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what will thy friar in bungay lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had heard the story of the friars twicerepeated vision and quest the minstrel sat silent awhile with knitted brow and head sunk on his breast then he eyed hilarius half humorously half tenderly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> methinks lad an thy friar alloweth it i will even go to bungay with thee for i love thee well lad and would have thy company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also i like not the matter of the vision and would fain see the end of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night the dream came again to the friar and a voice cried haste haste ere it be too late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so hilarius and martin came to bungay the friar guiding them for the way was his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of the three ever saw st edmunds abbey again for in one short month the minster with its sister churches was turned to be a spitalhouse while the dead lay in heaps silently waiting to summon to their ghastly company the living that sought to make them a bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quaint little bungay lay snug enough in the embrace of the low vinecrowned hills which half encircled common and town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the friar strode forward straining in his pace like a leashed hound martin and hilarius following <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once he stopped and turned a stricken face on his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a magpie went ducking across the road and hilarius crossed himself fearfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us make haste cried the friar when they told him and so at full pace they came to bungay town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place looked empty and deserted but from the distance came the roar and hum of an angry crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people are abroad said martin and his face was very grave no doubt some knight is here and there is a bearbaiting on the common <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prithee where is thy mothers dwelling good father and i will go and ask news of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis a lonely hovel by the waterside not far from the cattle gate goody wooten thou shalt ask for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin went swiftly forward over the common hilarius and the friar followed more slowly and when they came to the cattle gate they stood fast and waited the friar turning his head anxiously and straining to make his ears do a double service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius who had hitherto regarded bungay and the friars business as the last stage of his journey to wymondham and brother andreas was full of foreboding he watched martin on the outskirts of the crowd saw him throw up his hands with an angry gesture and point to the friar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he fell to parleying with the people but hilarius was too far off to catch what was said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see there tis her son martin was saying vehemently yon holy friar hath seen this thing in a vision but alack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reads it otherwise yea and hath hasted hither from overseas to wrestle with the evil one for his mothers soul and now and now the crowd parted and he saw the most miserable sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an old woman lay on the ground by the rivers edge a bundle of filthy waterlogged rags crowned by a bruised vindictive face and grey hair smeared with filth and slime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lay on her back a shapeless huddle her right thumb tied to her left toe and so across there was a rope about her middle but in their hot haste they had not stayed to strip her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin pressed forward and then turning to the jeering vengeful by christs rood this is an evil work ye have wrought he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay said one of the bystanders but it was fair judgment minstrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for years she hath worked her spells and black arts in this place ay and cattle have perished and women gone barren through her means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near two days agone a child was lost and seen last near her door ay and never seen again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we came to question her she cursed at us for meddling mischiefmakers and would but glare and spit and swear she knew naught of the misbegotten brat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe twas true eno said martin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hate these roughcast witchfindings tis not a matter for mans judgment unless tis sworn and proven in court before the justiciary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay joined in an old man what need of a justice when god speaks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we did but thole her to the river to see if she would sink or swim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the witch did swim as all can testify her master helping her and seeing that we drew her under ay and see her now as she lies and say whether the devil hath not set a mark on his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the love of christ lay her decently on her pallet and say no word of this to yon holy man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moved by his earnest manner one or two more kindly folk busied themselves unfastening the ropes and thongs which bound the witch and bore her to her wretched bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people in their previous eagerness had torn down the front of the miserable hovel she called home so all men could see the poor place and its dead dishonoured mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin finding his bidding accomplished turned to meet hilarius and the friar who were now coming slowly across the windswept common <end> <end> 
<start> <start> march mists gathered and draped the sluggish river the dry reeds rattled dismally in the ooze and sedge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius shivered and the friar started nervously when martin spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> friar he said god comfort thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all thy pains thou art too late to speed thy mothers soul she passed today and lies even now awaiting burial at thy faithful hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the friar drew a quick breath and hilarius questioned martin with a look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowd parted to let them through and hung their heads abashed in painful silence as the friar led by hilarius gave his blessing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were close to the mean hovel now and he turned to martin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didst thou hear of her end or did she die alone for the people feared her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay she died alone answered martin and muttered now god forgive me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they went into the wretched shed the setting sun broke through the lowering grey clouds and shone full on the dead woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it lighted each vicious line and hideous trait of the wrinkled toothless face and betrayed the mark of an evil life surcharged with horrid fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the friar stepped forward but martin stayed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay touch her not father it may be the pestilence as thou didst read in thy dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the friar fell on his knees and in the silence that followed was heard the drip drip drip from the sodden rags on the beaten earth floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people without staring openmouthed and silent saw the friar look up his hand hastily outstretched touched the dank muddy hair then he knew all and fell on his face with an exceeding bitter cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was answered by another cry the glad cry of a lost child that is found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the friar standing in front of that hovel of death preached to the cringing terrified people many of whom knelt and crouched in the downtrodden grass and quag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he threw up his arms and turned his blind anguished face to the setting sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take counsel but not of me that they may add sin to sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darkness shall come upon them death shall overtake them their place shall know them no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let them bare their backs to the scourge let them confess and repent ere i visit them as i visited sodom and gomorrah cities of the plain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o ye people ye have taken judgment in your hands and judged falsely withal but ye shall be judged in truth yea even according to your measure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repent repent for death cometh swiftly and maketh no long tarrying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it shall come it shall snatch mens souls away even as ye have torn away my mothers soul leaving no space for repentance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stretched his hands out over the common and pointed to the little town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your dwellings shall be desolate and this place a place of heaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye shall run hither and thither seeking safety and finding none for the arm of the lord is stretched out still because of the wickedness of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woe woe woe a disobedient and gainsaying people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woe woe woe a people hating righteousness and loving iniquity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lord shall straightway destroy them from off the face of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made an imperative gesture of dismissal and first one and then another in the crowd turned to slink home like beaten dogs snarling growling but afraid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius and martin buried the witch at the back of her wretched den and the friar the priest lost in the son prayed long by the else unhallowed grave and martin prayed beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius stood apart his lips set straight and said no prayer for what availed it to pray for an unassoilzied witch who had met her due damned alike by god and man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was his mother he said as if making excuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay but an evil liver and the people of bungay had wrought a good work in sending her to her own place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he crossed himself piously at the thought of the near neighbourhood of devils busied with a thricedamned soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin led them out of bungay by the earsham road and the friar clung to him like a little child for the strength of his vision was spent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they lay that night with a friendly shepherd but only one slept and that one hilarius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lay on a truss of sweet smelling hay and dreamt of wymondham and brother andreas of gold vermilion and blue of wondrous pictures and a great name and the scent of the pine forest at home swept across his quiet sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the morrow came the parting of the ways for hilarius was all aglow for wymondham and martin had charged himself with the friar at least as far as norwich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as well lead a blind friar as sing blindly at anothers bidding he said whimsically and so they bade one another farewell never to meet again in this world for martin and the friar went to yarmouth not norwich and there they perished among the first when the east wind swept the plague thither in a boatload of sickened shipmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hilarius once again the angel of the lord stood in the path of his desires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius fared but slowly it was ill travelling on a highroad in good weather but on a crossroad in the spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was a time to commend oneself body and soul to the saints <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked warily picking his way in and out of the bog between fence and ditch which was all that remained to show where the piety of the past once kept a road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the low land to his left was submerged a desolate tract giving back a sullen grey sky lifeless barren save where a gaunt poplar like the mast of a sunken ship broke the waste of waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight brought hilarius thoughts sharply back to the events of the evening before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wonderful indeed were the judgments of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a witch plainly proved to be such had been struck dead in the midst of her sins and london that lightminded reprobate city was a heap of graves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he hilarius having seen much evil and the justice of the almighty would get him in peace to wymondham there to learn to be a cunning limner and having so learnt would joyfully hie him back to prior stephen and his own monastery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the way led somewhat uphill and he saw to his right a small hamlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it lay some distance off his road but he was sharp set for the shepherds fare had been meagre and so turned aside in the hope of an alehouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no side road visible and he struck across the dank marshy fields until he lighted on a rude track which led to the group of cottages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place struck him as strangely quiet no smoke rose from the chimneys no dogs rushed out barking furiously at a strangers advent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first hovel he passed was empty the open door showed a fireless hearth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the second he knocked and heard a sound of scuffling within <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as no one answered his repeated summons he pushed the door open the low room was desolate but two bright eyes peered at him from a corner twas a rat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius turned away sudden fear at his heart and passed on finding in each hovel only empty silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apart from the rest standing alone in a field was a somewhat larger cottage a bush swung from the projecting pole above the door it was the alehouse that he sought here at least he would find some one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he came up he heard a child crying and lo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the doorstep sat a dirty little maid of some four summers sobbing away for dear life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius approached diffidently and stooped down to wipe away the grimy tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the child regarded him round eyes open mouth then with a shrill cry of joy she held out her thin arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sound of her cry the door opened on the threshold stood a woman still young but haggard and wearyeyed at her breast was a little babe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stared at hilarius and then pulling the child to her in the doorway waved him away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay they were lightfooted eno when they saw what was to do and left us three to die like rats in a hole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then eagerly hast thou any bread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay i came here seeking some <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis two days sin i had bite or sup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a matter of an hour over yonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see goodwife said hilarius i will go buy thee food and come again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so said another and he never came back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay but perchance some evil befell him said gentle hilarius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went in and returned with a few small coins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell no man whence thou art else they will hunt thee from their doors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius nodded took the money and ran as fast as he could go in the direction of the village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it fear or love that lends him that pace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she muttered as she sat down to wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it will satisfy you i will write you a line to morrow night and tell you where i am and you can come is that a promise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i will take these things to your neighbour and i never in all my life saw a man so wild over designs said the girl as she started toward the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont forget that the design im craziest about is the same as the red birds the harvester flung after her but she hurried on and made no reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he folded the table and chair rolled the rug and shouldering them picked up the bucket and started down the river bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a faint little call he never would have been sure he heard anything if belshazzar had not stopped suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hair on the back of his neck arose and he turned with a growl in his throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester dropped his load with a crash and ran in leaping bounds but the dog was before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half way to the house ruth jameson swayed in the grip of her uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one hand clutched his coat front in a spasmodic grasp and with the other she covered her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the roar the harvester sent up stayed the big lifted fist and the dog leaped for a throat hold and compelled the man to defend himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester never knew how he covered the space until he stood between them and saw the girl draw back and snatch together the front of her dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> make him oh then for a few seconds things happened too rapidly to record <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once the harvester tossed a torn envelope exposing money to the girl and again a revolver and then both men panting and dishevelled were on their feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the harvester in a voice of deadly quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is all here said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has been stealing the price of my cattle from my you are lying said the harvester deliberately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i just paid it to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were trying oh she is in your pay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you say an insulting word i think very probably i will finish you said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can with my naked hands and all your neighbours will say it is a you have forfeited all right to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will a horrible laugh broke from the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that is the end of my saintly niece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the harvester advancing a step <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you marry me and go to the shelter of my home wildeyed she stared at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i love you and want life made easier for you are the dream girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought the red bird told you for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know it would be a shock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i by that time she was shaking with a nervous chill and the sight unmanned the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will decide what first it was marry now its decide later broke in henry jameson crazed with anger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> move a step and ill strike you down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id better than see you the harvester advanced and jameson stepped back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth said the harvester i know how impossible this seems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is giving you no chance at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had intended when i found you to court you tenderly as girl ever was wooed before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come with me and ill do it yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the new home was built for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sunshine room is ready and waiting for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is pure air fresh water nothing but rest and comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill nurse you back to health and strength and you shall impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only if you make it so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will come now we can be married in a few hours and you can be safe in your own home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i realize now that this is unexpected and shocking to you but if you will come with me and allow me to restore you to health and strength and if say in a year you are convinced that you do not love me i will set you free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will come i swear to you that you shall be my wife first and my honoured guest afterward until such time as you either tell me you love me or that it will end fear uncertainty and work until you are strong and well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will give you home rest and love that you will find is worth your consideration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she started toward him holding out the envelope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry jameson with a dreadful oath sprang for it his contorted face a drawn snarl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester caught him in air and sent him reeling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he snatched the revolver from the girl and put the money in his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth i cant leave you here he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you afraid of me yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wont you you are right about that my lady you will come back to the house thats what youll do said henry jameson starting toward her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh heaven help ruth you must come with me said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood between them and gave henry jameson one long searching look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she turned to the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am far less afraid of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will accept your offer she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will keep my word and you shall have no regrets <end> <end>

<start> <start> i will take nothing but the trunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what you are thinking but you will not get your gun just now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will return and the first thing i do with it will be to use it on you said henry jameson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill report that threat to the police so that they can see you properly hanged if you do retorted the harvester as he followed the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked as he overtook her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he reached the house he told her to watch the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went inside broke the lock from the gun in the corner found the trunk and swinging it to his shoulder passed henry jameson and went back through the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester set the trunk in the wagon helped the girl in and returned for the load he had dropped at her call <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he took the lines and started for onabasha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl beside him was almost fainting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped to give her a drink and tried to encourage her <end> <end>

<start> <start> as the slip was returned to him without a glance he folded it and slid it under a wicket <end> <end>

<start> <start> now we will go to the court house <end> <end>

<start> <start> i want a marriage license in with the document in his possession they went to the store he designated where he found the girl a chair in the fitting room while he went to see the manager <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want one of your most sensible and accommodating clerks said the harvester and i would like a few words when she was presented he scrutinized her carefully and decided she would do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have many thanks and something more substantial for a woman who will help me to carry through a slightly unusual project with sympathy and ability he said if i can said the clerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has put up your other orders interposed the i dont know said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have not yet reached the one for whom they were intended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i want you to do he said to the clerk is to go to the fitting room and dress the girl you find there for her wedding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had other plans but death disarranged them and she has only an hour in which to meet the event most girls love to linger over for months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has been ill and is worn with watching but some time she may look back to her wedding day with joy and if only you would help me to make the best of it for her i would be as i said under more obligations than i can i will do anything said the clerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has come from the country entirely unprepared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> save her all the embarrassment you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep a memorandum slip of what is the limit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is none said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put the prettiest things on her you have in the right sizes and if you are is she ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired the manager at the door an hour later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am said the girl stepping through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the astounded harvester stood and stared utterly oblivious of the curious people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he whistled it in the red birds most entreating tones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl laughed and the colour in her face deepened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the manager of the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was so busy getting everything else ready i forgot all about myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i should say not said the manager <end> <end>

<start> <start> it wouldnt keep me thinking so much of the remainder of that dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are the loveliest sight do i really appear well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the girl hungry for appreciation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never could have guessed that such a miracle could be wrought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not know there was kindness like that in all the world for a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not feel lost or embarrassed except the first few seconds when i didnt know what to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i thank you for this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever comes in life i always shall love to remember that i was daintily dressed and appeared as well as i could when i was married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i must tell you i am not real <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did everything on earth to me three of them working at a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel an increase in selfrespect in some way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> david i do when she said david the harvester looked out of the window and gulped down his delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shut your eyes and imagine you see the red bird he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in my soul i am saying to you again and again just what he sang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are wonderfully beautiful ruth and more than wonderfully sweet <end> <end>

<start> <start> this wedding wont be hurt by putting all the sacredness into it we can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that you will accept and wear my mothers wedding i am more pleased than i can tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i have she took off her glove and the harvester held her hand closely a second then lifted it to his lips passionately kissed it and slipped on a ring the setting a big lustrous pearl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked at some others he said but nothing got a second glance save this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they knew you were coming down the ages and so they got the pearls ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how beautiful it is on your hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put on the glove and wear that ring as if you had owned it for the long happy year of betrothal every girl should have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can start yours today and if by this time next year i have not won you to my heart and arms im no man and not worthy of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth you will try just a little i will try with all my heart she said instantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am perfectly happy with that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never expected to marry you before a year anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the difference will be the blessed fact that instead of coming to see you somewhere else i now can have you in my care and court you every minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might as well make up your mind to capitulate soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if an instant ever comes when i realize that i love you i will come straight and tell you believe me i thank you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is going to be quite a proper wedding after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be over soon and you on the home way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl smiled at him as he opened the carriage door helped her up the steps and rang the bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these people will be as kind as they were the minister was gentle and wasted no time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife and daughter who appeared for witnesses kissed ruth and congratulated her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and the harvester stood took the vows exchanged rings and returned to the carriage a man and his wife by the laws of man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drive to seatons cafe the harvester said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is so good i hate to stop it for something you may not like so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ordered lunch and if we dont eat it i will have to pay for it anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wouldnt no said the girl and besides since you mention good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth you wouldnt allow me to hold your hand just until we reach the cafe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might save me from bursting with yes she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i must take off my lovely id hate the glove being removed dreadfully said the harvester his eyes dancing and snapping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sorry i am so thin and shaky said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on your life you will said the harvester taking the hand gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there are a number of things a man deeply in love can think of to do with a womans white hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can stroke it press it tenderly and lay it against his lips and his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester lacked experience in these arts and yet by some wonderful instinct all of these things occurred to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was real colour in the girls cheeks by the time he helped her into the cafe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were guided to a small room cool and restful close a window beside which grew a tree covered with talking leaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a waiting attendant who seemed perfectly adept brought in steaming bouillon fragrant tea broiled chicken properly cooked vegetables a wonderful salad and then delicious ices and cold fruit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the happy harvester leaned back and watched the girl daintily manage almost as much food as he wanted to see her eat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they had finished now we are going home indeed i will she promised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i grow accustomed to the dreadful stillness and learn what ill have to ask you to wait a minute he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must hire a man to take betsy no maam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are going in a carriage or a motor said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have had this all your way so far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going home but your dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people will think i am crazy to let them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should we bother about other people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going with betsy the harvester had been thinking that he adored her that it was impossible to love her more but every minute was proving to him that he was capable of feeling so profound it startled him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to carry the girl his bride through the valley and up the hill in the little spring wagon drawn by betsythat would have been his ideal way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had supposed that she would be afraid of soiling her dress and embarrassed to ride in such a conveyance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he could love her more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come this way a few steps he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> betsy is the girl laid her face against the nose of the faithful old animal and stroked her head and neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she held her skirts and the harvester helped her into the wagon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took the seat and the dog went wild with joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on bel she softly commanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dog hesitated and looked at the harvester for permission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may come here and put your head on my knee said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belshazzar you lucky dog you are privileged to sit there and lay your head on the ladys lap said the harvester and the dog quivered with joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the man picked up the lines gave a backward glance to the bed of the wagon high piled with large bundles and turned betsy toward medicine woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the crowded streets and toward the country they drove when a big red car passed a man called to them then reversed and slowly began backing beside the wagon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is my best friend doctor carey of the hospital ruth he said hastily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i tell him and will you certainly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor peered with gleaming eyes from under the car top <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the harvester as man greets man with a full heart when he is sure of sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come give us your best sendoff doc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were married an hour ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are headed for medicine woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doctor mighty glad to know you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the doctor reaching a happy hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl met it cordially while she smiled on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why didnt you let us know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is hardly fair of you david <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might have let me and the missus share that is to be explained said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was decided on very suddenly and rather sadly on account of the death of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forced ruth to marry me and come with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i grow rather frightened when i think of it but it was the only way i knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she absolutely refused my other plans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see before you dont believe him doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you know him you will understand that to offer all he had was like him when he saw my necessity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will ill come right now said the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill bring oh no you wont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you observe the bed of this wagon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this happened all unbeknownst to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have to set up housekeeping after we reach home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will notify you when we are ready for visitors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just you subside and wait until you why david <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good he leaned down and held out his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grip that caught it said all any words could convey and then betsy started up the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first the road lay between fertile farms dotted with shocked wheat covered with undulant seas of ripening oats and forests of growing corn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the larks were trailing melody above the shorn and growing fields the quail were ingathering beside the fences and from the forests on graceful wings slipped the nighthawks and sailed and soared dropping so low that the half moons formed by white spots on their spread wings showed plainly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why is this country so different from the other side of the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is older replied the harvester and it lies higher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was settled and well cultivated when that was a swamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as a farming proposition the money is in the lowland like your uncles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crops raised there i see said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this is much better to look at and the air is different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it lacks a soggy depressing i dont allow any air to surpass that of medicine woods said the harvester by especial arrangement then they dipped into a little depression and arose to cross the railroad and then followed a longer valley that was ragged and unkempt compared with the road between cultivated fields <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester was busy trying to plan what to do first and how to do it most effectively and working his brain to think if he had everything the girl would require for her comfort so he drove silently through the deepening shadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shuddered and awoke him suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he glanced at her from the corner of his eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her thoughts had gone on a journey also and the way had been rough for her face wore a strained appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hands lying bare in her lap were tightly gripped so that the nails and knuckles appeared blue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester hastily cast around seeking for the cause of the transformation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few minutes ago she had seemed at ease and comfortable now she was close open panic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing had been said that would disturb her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with brain alert he searched for the reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it began to come to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the unaccustomed silence and depression of the country might have been the beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> coming from the city and crowds of people to the gloomy valley with a man almost a stranger going she knew not where to conditions she knew not what with the experiences of the day vivid before her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the black valley road was not prepossessing with its border of green pools through which grew swamp bushes and straggling vines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester looked carefully at the road and ceased to marvel at the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he disliked to let her know he understood so he gave one last glance at those gripped hands and casually held out the lines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you take these just a second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont let them touch your dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must not lose of our load because its mostly things that will make he arose and turning pretended to see that everything was all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he resumed his seat and drove on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a little ashamed of this stretch through here he said apologetically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could have managed to have it cleared and in better shape long ago but in a way it yields a snug profit and so far ive preferred the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the land is not mine but i could grub out is there stuff here you use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl aroused herself to ask and the harvester saw the look of relief that crossed her face at the sound of his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i should say yes he laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those bushes numerous everywhere with the hanging yellowgreen balls those in bark and root go into fever medicines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not so much used now but sometimes i have a call and when i do i pass the beds on myon our land and come down here and get what is needed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that bush he indicated with the whip blooms exquisitely in the spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a relative of flowering dogwood and the one of its many names i like best is ive planted some for you in a hedge along the driveway so next spring you can gather all you want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think youll like the odour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bark brings more than true dogwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i get a call from some house that uses it i save mine and come down here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around the edge are hop trees and i realize something from them and also the false and true bittersweet that run riot here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both of them have pretty leaves while the berries of the true hang all winter and the colour is gorgeous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive set your hedge closely with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it has grown a few months its going to furnish flowers in the spring a million different wonderful leaves and berries in the summer many fruits the birds love in the fall and bright yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think it will be beautiful in a season or two it isnt so bad now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope it will call myriads of birds to keep you company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you cross this stretch of road hereafter dont see fetid water and straggling bushes i am perfectly tolerant of it now she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will come with you and help collect the roots and barks you want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which bush did you say relieved the poor souls scorching with the harvester drew on the lines betsy swerved to the edge of the road and he leaned and broke a branch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buttonbush because those balls resemble round buttons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see how waxy and gracefully cut and set the leaves are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go on betsy get us home before night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we appear our best early in the morning when the sun tops medicine woods and begins to light us up and in the evening just when she drops behind onabasha back there and strikes us with a few level rays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you she laid the twig in her lap on the white gloves and took the lines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the gate swung wide betsy walked through and stopped at the usual place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now my girl said the harvester cross yourself lean back and take your ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this side that gate to you you mean said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to us i mean declared the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you know that the worldly goods bestowal clause in a marriage ceremony is a partial reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doesnt give you all my worldly goods but it gives you one third <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which will you take the hill lake marsh or a part of did i forget to mention that i was formerly sole owner and proprietor of the lake of lost loons also a brook of singing water and many cold springs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lake covers about one third of our land and my neighbours would allow me ditch outlet to the river but they lazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do they mean drain your lake into the they do said the harvester and make the bed she turned to him with confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent so far but of course when you see it if you would prefer it in a cornlets play a game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turn your head in this direction he indicated with the whip close your eyes and open them when i say now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were at the foot of a small levee that ran to the bridge crossing singing water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the left lay the valley through which the stream swept from its hurried rush down the hill a marshy thicket of vines shrubs and bushes the banks impassable with water growth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everywhere flamed foxfire and cardinal flower thousands of wild tiger lilies lifted gorgeous orangered trumpets beside pearlwhite turtle head and moon daisies while all the creek bank was a coral line with the first opening bloom of big pink mallows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rank jewel flower poured gold from dainty cornucopias and lavender beardtongue offered honey to a million bumbling bees water smart weed spread a glowing pink background and twining amber dodder topped the marsh in lacy mist with its delicate white bloom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straight before them a white sanded road climbed to the bridge and up a gentle hill between the young hedge of small trees and bushes where again flowers and bright colours rioted and led to the cabin yet invisible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the right the hill crowned with gigantic forest trees sloped to the lake midway the building stood and from it among scattering trees all the way to the waters edge were immense beds of vivid colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a scarf of gold flung across the face of earth waved the misty saffron and beside the road running down the hill in a sunny open space arose treelike specimens of thrifty magenta pokeberry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down the hill crept the masses of colour changing from dry soil to water growth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> high around the bluegreen surface of the lake waved lacy heads of wild rice lower cattails bulrushes and marsh grasses arrowhead lilies lifted spines of pearly bloom while yellow water lilies and blue water hyacinths intermingled here and there grew a pink stretch of water smartweed and the dangling gold of jewel flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the water bordering the edge starry faces of white pond lilies floated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blue flags waved graceful leaves willows grew in clumps and vines clambered everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the growth of the lake shore duck coot and grebe voices commingled in the last chattering hastened splash of securing supper before bedtime crying killdeers crossed the water and overhead the nighthawks massed in circling companies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> betsy climbed the hill and at every step the girl cried slower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with wide eyes she stared around her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why didnt you tell me it would be like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have i had opportunity to describe much of anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides i was born and reared here and while it has been a garden of bloom for the past six years only it always has been a picture but one forgets to say much about a sight seen every that white mist down there what is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pearls grown by the almighty answered the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flowers that i hope you will love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tall and slender graceful pearl white and and the wonderful purplishred there on the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not going to ask what another colour is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill just worship will you forgive me if i tell you what a woman she says god proves that he loves it best of all the tints in his workshop by using it first and most sparingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then they came upon the bridge crossing singing water and there was a long view of its border rippling bed and marshy banks while on the other hand the lake resembled a richly incrusted sapphire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to remain here a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care what else there is to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could bring down a bed and sleep here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id like to have a table and draw and paint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understand now what you mean about the designs you mentioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw anything so appealing in all now the harvesters mother had designed that bridge and he had built it with much care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from barkcovered railings to solid oak floor and comfortable benches running along the sides it was intended to be a part of the landscape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill send belshazzar to the cabin with the wagon but you must not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i why dont you change them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid i forgot everything i had said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are shoes somewhere in this load <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought of them in getting other things for you but i had no idea as to size and so i told that clerk today when she you are horribly extravagant she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if the harvester mounted the wagon and hunted until he found a large box and opening it on the bench he disclosed almost every variety of shoe walking shoe and slipper a girl ever owned as well as sandals and high overshoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll never get them paid for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never take anything back said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be sure you are right then go ahead is my motto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i know these are your correct size and that for differing occasions you will want just such shoes as other girls have and here they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think these will serve because they are for street wear yet he produced a pair of canvas walking shoes and kneeling before her held out his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had finished he loaded the box on the wagon gave the hitching strap to belshazzar and told him to lead betsy to the cabin and hold her until he came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he turned to the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he said look as long as you choose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but remember that the law gives you part of this and your lover which same am i gives you the remainder so you are privileged to come here at any hour as often as you please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you miss anything this evening you id like to live right here on this bridge she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roof it tomorrow offered the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> simple matter of a few pillars already cut joists joined and some slab shingles left from the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything else i was born that way explained the harvester and ive cultivated the faculty until ive developed real genius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> talking of sense there never was a proper marriage in which the man didnt give the woman a present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you seem likely to be more appreciative of this bridge than anything else i have so right here and now would be the appropriate place to offer you my wedding gift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt have much time but i couldnt he held out a small white velvet case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doesnt that look as if it were made for a bride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marrying as we did you never can believe that i love you maybe it wont ever happen that i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no right to accept gifts and expensive clothing from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place if the love you ask never comes there is no possible way in which i can repay you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the second these things you are offering are not suitable for life and work in the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the third i think you are being extravagant and i couldnt you divide your statements like a preacher dont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now sit thee here and gaze on the placid lake and quiet your troubled spirit while i demolish your perfectly good arguments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place you are now my wife and you have a right to take anything i offer if you care for it or can use it in any manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the second you must recognize a difference in our positions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what seems nothing to you means all the world to me and you are less than human if you deprive me of the joy of expressing feelings i am in honour bound to keep in my heart by these little material offerings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the third place i inherited over six hundred acres of land and water please observe the waterit is now in evidence on your left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all my life i have been taught to be frugal economical and to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all ive earned either has gone back into land into the bank or into books very plain food and such clothing as you now see me wearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just the value of this place as it stands with its big trees its drug crops yielding all the year round would be difficult to estimate and i dont mind telling you that on the top of that hill there is a gold mine acres and acres of wild ginseng seven years of age and ready to harvest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you remember what your few exactly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for your peace of mind i might add that all i have done or got is paid for except what i bought today and i will write a check for that as soon as the bill is made out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my bank account never will feel it truly ruth i am not doing or going to do anything extravagant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant afford to give you diamond necklaces yachts and trips to europe but you can have the contents of this box and a motor boat on the lake a horse and carriage and a tripsay to new york i wish you wouldnt ask me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would be happier yes but i do ask you persisted the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not the only one to be considered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have some rights also and im not so selfeffacing that i wont insist upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from your standpoint i am almost a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have spent no time considering me in near relations i realize that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you feel as if you were driven here for a refuge and that is true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said to belshazzar one day that i must remember that you had no dream and had spent no time loving me and i do i know how this wedding seems to you but its going to mean something different and better soon please god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can see your side now suppose you take a look at mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did have a dream it was my dream and beyond the sum of any delight i ever conceived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the strength of it i rebuilt my home and remodelled these premises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i saw you and from that day i worked early and late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lost you and i never stopped until i found you and i would have courted and won you but the fates intervened and here you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so its my delight to court and win you now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you knew the difference between having a dream that stirred the least fibre of your being and facing the world in a demand for realization of it and then finding what you coveted in the palm of your hand as it were you would know what is in my heart and why expression of some kind is necessary to me just now and why ill explode if it is denied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will lower the tension if you will accept this as a matter of fact as if you rather expected the harvester set his finger on the spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill never have the courage if you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give it to me in the case and let me open it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> despite your unanswerable arguments i am quite sure the harvester gave her the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she exclaimed more to herself than to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should i be the buffet of all the unkind fates kept in store for a girl my whole life and then suddenly be offered home beautiful gifts and wonderful the harvester ran his fingers through his crisp hair pulled it into a peak stepped to the seat and sitting on the railing he lifted his elbows tilted his head and began a motley outpouring of halfspoken halfwhistled trills and imploring cries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was enough similarity that the girl instantly recognized the red bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of breath the harvester dropped to the seat beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dont you keep forgetting it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now open that box and put on the trinket because i want to take you to the cabin when the sun falls level on the she opened the case exposing a thread of gold that appeared too slender for the weight of an exquisite pendant set with shimmering pearls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will look down there the harvester pointed over the railing to the arrowhead lilies touched with they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which is more beautiful i do not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you wont like it she held the open case toward the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> possession is nine points in the law he quoted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have taken it already and it is in your hands now make the gift perfect for me by putting it on and my wedding gift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly she lifted the beautiful ornament and held it in the light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im so glad you just force me to take it she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any halfnormal girl would be delighted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and whats more i am going to keep and wear it and my ring at suitable times all my life in memory of what you have done to be kind to me on this awful thank you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i if i had known for any length of time that this day was coming and bringing you as most men know when a girl is to be given into their care i could have made it different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it is ive done the best i knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all your after life i hope you will believe this just that if you missed anything today that would have made it easier for you or more pleasant the reason was because of my ignorance of women and the conventions and lack of time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to know and to feel that in my heart those vows i took were real <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is undoubtedly all the marrying i will ever want to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am oldfashioned in my ways and deeply imbued with the spirit of the woods and that means unending evolution along the same lines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to me you are my revered and beloved wife my mate now and i am sure nothing will make me feel any different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the day of my marriage to the only woman i ever have thought of wedding and to me it is joy unspeakable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with other men such a day ends differently from the close of this with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i have done and will continue to do the level best i know for you this oration is the prologue to asking you for one gift to me from you a wedding gift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want it unless you can bestow it ungrudgingly and truly want me to have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you can i will have all from this day i hope for at the hands of fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i have the gift she lifted startled eyes to his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may seem much to you said the harvester to me it appears only a gracious act from a wonderful woman if you will give me freely one real kiss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never had one save from a dream girl ruth and you will have to make yours pretty good if it is anything like hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are woman enough to know that most men crush their brides in their arms and take a thousand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill put my hands behind me and never move a muscle and i wont ask for more if you will crown my wedding day with only one touch of your lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you kiss the girl lifted a piteous face down which big tears suddenly rolled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what kind of a heart have i that it fails to respond to such a plea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have i been overworked and starved so long there is no feeling in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont understand why i dont take you in my arms and kiss you a hundred times but you see i dont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doesnt seem as if i ever never mind said the harvester gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only a fancy of mine bred from my dream and unreasonable perhaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry i mentioned it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun is on the stoop now i want you to enter your home in he half lifted her from the bench <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going to help you up the drive as i used to assist mother he said fighting to keep his voice natural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clasp your hands before you and draw your elbows to your sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now let me take one in each palm and you will scoot but i dont want to scoot she said unsteadily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary you dont want to do any such i had forgotten there would be any tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems as if the day would end it and set me adrift you are going to awake in the gold room with the sun shining on your face in the morning and its going to keep on all your life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if youve got a smile in your anatomy bring it to the surface for just beyond his voice was clear and steady now his confidence something contagious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a lovely smile on her face as she looked at him and stepped into the line of light crossing the driveway and then she stopped and cried oh lovely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then maybe the harvester was not glad he had planned worked unceasingly and builded as well as he knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cabin of large peeled golden oak logs oiled to preserve them nestled like a big mushroom on the side of the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above and behind the building the trees arose in a green setting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the roof was stained to their shades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wide veranda was enclosed in screening over which wonderful vines climbed in places and round it grew ferns and deepwood plants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inside hung big baskets of wild growth there was a wide swinging seat with a back rest supported by heavy chains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were chairs and a table of bent saplings and hickory withes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two full stories the building arose and the western sun warmed it almost to orangeyellow while the graceful vines crept toward the roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl looked at the rapidly rising hedge on each side of her at the white floor of the drive and long and long at the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you did all this since february <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even to transforming the landscape answered the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i wish it was not coming night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want the dark to come until you have told me the name of every tree and shrub of that wonderful hedge and every plant and vine of the veranda and oh i want to follow up the driveway and see that beautiful little creeklisten to it chuckle and laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it always glad like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see the ferns and things that grow on the other side of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why there are big beds of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and lilies of the valley by the acre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is never mind that now said the harvester guiding her up the steps along the gravelled walk to the screen that he opened and over a flood of gold light she crossed the veranda and entered the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now here it appears bare said the harvester because i didnt know what should go on the walls or what rugs to get or about the windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the table chairs and couch i made myself with some help from a carpenter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are solid black walnut and will age they are beautiful said the girl softly touching the shining table top with her fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please put the necklace on me now i have to use my eyes and hands she held out the box and the harvester lifted the pendant and clasped the chain around her neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she glanced at the lustrous pearls and then the fingers of one hand softly closed over them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went through the long wide livingroom examining the chairs and mantel stopping to touch and exclaim over its array of halffinished candlesticks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the door of his room she paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mine said the harvester turning the knob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill give you one peep to satisfy your curiosity and show you the location of the bridge over which you came to me in my dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reserve not goblins but a man alive so heed your warning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the floor was cement three of the walls heavy screening with mosquito wire inside the roof slab shingled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the inner wall was a bookcase below it a desk at one side a gun cabinet at the other a bath in a small alcove beside a closet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room contained two chairs like those of the veranda and the bed was a low oak couch covered with a thick mattress of hemlock twigs topped with sweet fern on which the sun shone all day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a chair at the foot were spread some white sheets a blanket and an oilcloth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun beat in the wind drifted through and one lying on the couch could see down the bright hill and sweep the lake to the opposite bank without lifting the head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester drew the girl to the bedside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now straight in a line from here he said across the lake to that big scraggy oak every clear night the moon builds a bridge of molten gold and once you walked it my girl and came straight to me alone and unafraid and you were gracious and lovely beyond anything a man ever dreamed of before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill have that to think of tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now come see the diningroom kitchen and he led her into what had been the front room of the old cabin now a large long diningroom having on each side wide windows with deep seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fireplace backwall was against that of the livingroom but here the mantel was bare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the woodwork chairs the dining table cupboards and carving table were golden oak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only a few rugs and furnishings and a womans touch were required to make it an unusual and beautiful room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kitchen was shining with a white hardwood floor white woodwork and pale green walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a light airy sanitary place supplied with a pump sink hot and cold water faucets refrigerator and every modern convenience possible to the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the harvester almost carried the girl up the stairs and showed her three large sleeping rooms empty and bare save for some packing cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know about these so i didnt do anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you find time to plan tell me what you want and ill makeor buy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all have closets and pipes from the furnace so they will be comfortable in winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there is your place remaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill leave you while i stable betsy and feed he guided her to the door opening from the living room to the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the sunshine spot he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is bathed in morning light and sheltered by afternoon shade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> singing water is across the drive there to talk to you always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it comes pelting down so fast it never freezes so it makes music all winter and the birds are so numerous youll have to go to bed early for theyll wake you by dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i noticed this room was going to be full of sunshine when i built it and i craved only brightness for you so i coaxed all of it to stay that i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every stroke is the work of my hands and all of the furniture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you will like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the room of which ive been telling you ruth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go in and take possession and ill entreat god and all his ministering angels to he opened the door guided her inside closed it and went swiftly to his work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl stood and looked around her with amazed eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the floor was pale yellow wood polished until it shone like a table top <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the casings table chairs dressing table chest of drawers and bed were solid curly maple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doors were big polished slabs of it each containing enough material to veneer all the furniture in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the walls were of plaster tinted yellow and the windows with yellow shades were curtained in dainty white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could hear the harvester carrying the load from the wagon to the front porch the clamour of the barn yard and as she went to the north window to see the view a shining peacock strutted down the walk and went to the harvesters hand for grain while scores of snowwhite doves circled over his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stepped on deep rugs of yellow goat skins and glancing at the windows on either side she opened the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> outside it lay a porch with a railing but no roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on each post stood a box filled with yellow woodflowers and trailing vines of pale green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a big tree rising through one corner of the floor supplied the cover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gate opened to a walk leading to the driveway and on either side lay a patch of sod outlined by a deep hedge of bright gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in it saffron coneflowers blackeyed susans goldenrod wild sunflowers and jewel flower grew and some of it enough to form a yellow line was already in bloom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around the porch and down the walk were beds of yellow violets pixie moss and every tiny gold flower of the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl leaned against the tree and looked around her and then staggered inside and dropped on the couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes an artist with earth for his canvas and growing she lay there staring at the walls the beautiful wood work and furniture the dressing table with its array of toilet articles a low chair before it and the thick rug for her feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over and over she looked at everything and then closed her eyes and lay quietly too weary and overwhelmed to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by came tapping at the door and she sprang up and crossing to the dressing table straightened her hair and composed her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ajax demands to see you cried a gay voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont be frightened if he screams at you warned the harvester as she passed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he detests a stranger it was a question what was in the head of the bird as he saw the strange looking creature invading his domain and he did scream a wild high strident wail that delighted the harvester inexpressibly because it sent the girl headlong into his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has such a beautiful bird got a noise in it like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why ive fed them in parks and i never heard one explode then how the harvester laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you see you are in the woods now and this is not a park bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be the test of your power to see i am afraid i cant tell you that said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to invent a plan for myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it required a long time and much petting and my methods might not avail for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will interest you to study that out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the member of the family it is positively essential that you win to a life and death allegiance is belshazzar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you can make him love you he will protect you at every turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will go before you into the forest and all the crawling creeping things will get out of his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will nose around the flowers you want to gather and if he growls and the hair on the back of his neck rises never forget that you must heed that warning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few times i have not stopped for it and i always have been sorry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far as anything animate or uncertain footing is concerned you are always perfectly safe if you obey him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about touching plants and flowers you must confine yourself to those you are certain you know until i can teach you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are gorgeous and wonderfully attractive things here but some of them are rank poison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wont handle plants you dont know i will not she promised instantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went to the seat under the porch tree and leaning against the trunk she studied the hill and the rippling course of singing water where it turned and curved before the cabin and started across the vivid little marsh toward the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she looked at the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seated himself on the low railing and smiled at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are right about the air being so far as pure air location and water are concerned said the harvester i consider this place ideal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lake is large enough to cool the air and raise sufficient moisture to dampen it and too small to make it really cold and disagreeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slope of the hill gives perfect drainage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heaviest rains do not wet the earth for more than three hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> north south and west breezes sweep the cool air from the water to the cabin in summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same suns warm us here on the winter hillside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my violets spring beauties anemones and dutchmans breeches here are always two weeks ahead of those in the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not afraid of your not liking the location or the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the cabin if you dont care for that its very simple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill transform it into a laboratory and dryhouse and build you whatever you want within my means over there on the hill just across singing water and facing the valley toward onabasha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing that worries me is what you are going to do for company especially while dont trouble yourself about anything she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just say in your heart she is going to be stronger than she ever has been in her life in this lovely place and she has more right now than she ever had or hoped to have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for one thing i am going to study your books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never have had time before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while we sewed or embroidered mother talked by the hour of the great writers of the world told me what they wrote and how they expressed books are my company said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doc and his wife come most and if you look out some day and see a whitehaired bent old woman with a face as sweet as dawn coming up the bank of singing water that will be my mothers friend granny moreland who joins us on the north over there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is frank and brusque so she says what she thinks with unmistakable distinctness but her heart is big and tender and her philosophy keeps her sweet and kindly id love to have her come said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is that your favourite word laughed the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reason lies with me or rather with my mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some day i will tell you the whole story and the cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think now i can encompass it in this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when medicinal herbs roots and barks became so scarce that some of the most important were almost extinct it occurred to me that it would be a good idea to stop travelling miles and poaching on the woods of other people and turn our land into an herb garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for four years before mother went and six since ive worked with all my might and results are beginning to take shape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while ive been at it of course my neighbours had an inkling of what was going on and ive been called a fool lazy and a fanatic because i did not fell the trees and plow for corn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you readily can see im a little short of corn ground out there he waved toward the marsh and lake and up there he indicated the steep hill and wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but somewhere on this land ive been able to find muck for mallows water for flags and willows shade for ferns lilies and ginseng rocky sunny spaces for mullein and open fertile beds for bouncing betjust for examples <end> <end> 
<start> <start> god never evolved a place better suited for an herb farm from and indescribably lovely added the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i think it is said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the days when i didnt know how it was coming out i was sensitive about it so i kept quiet and worked and allowed the other fellow to do the talking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a while the ginseng bed grew a treasure worth guarding and i didnt care for any one to know how much i had or where it was as a matter of precaution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ginseng and money are synonymous and i was forced to be away certainly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they knew it was there and what it is worth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as ive told you much of the stuff here must not be handled except by experts and i didnt want people coming in my absence and taking risks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the remainder of my reason thank you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some day ill tell you of a very solemn oath ive had to keep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wouldnt understand at least not now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the day ever comes when i think you will ill tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just now i can express it by that one word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt dare fail or i felt i would be lost as my father was before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i remained away from the city and its temptations and men of my age and worked in the woods until i was tired enough to drop read books that helped tinkered with the carving and sometimes i had an idea and i went into that little building behind the dryhouse took out my different herbs and tried my hand at compounding a new cure for some of the pains of humanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it keeps a fellow at a fairly decent level and some good may come of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> carey is trying several formulae for me and if they work ill carry them higher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if not one cent more than ive got said the harvester emphatically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when any man accumulates more than he can earn with his own hands he begins to enrich himself at the expense of the youth the sweat the blood the joy of his fellow men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can go to the city take a look and see what money does as a rule and its another thing im afraid of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will find me a dreadful coward on those two points <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to know society and its ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see what it does to other men it would be presumption to reckon myself stronger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for money ive watched the cross cuts and the quick and easy ways to accumulate it but ive had something in me that held me to the slow sure clean work of my own hands and its yielded me enough for one for two even in a reasonable degree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so ive worked read compounded and carved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i couldnt wear myself down enough to sleep by any other method i went into the lake and swam across and back and that is guaranteed to put any man to rest six years said the girl softly as she studied him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think it has set a mark on you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe i can trace it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your forehead brow and eyes bear the lines and the appearance of all experience all comprehension but your lips are those of a very young lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt be surprised if i had that kiss ready for you and i really oh good lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the harvester turning a backward somersault over the railing and starting in big bounds up the drive toward the stable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he passed around it and into the woods at a rush and a few seconds later from somewhere on the top of the hill his strong he sang it through at the top of his lungs that majestic old hymn but there was no music at all it was simply a roar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by he came soberly to the barn and paused to stroke betsys nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop chewing grass and listen to me he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes going to remain you can stake your oats on that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes going to be the loveliest and sweetest girl in all the world and because youre a beast ill tell you something a man never could know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down with your ear you critter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes going to kiss me betsy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this very night before i lay me her lips meet mine and maybe you think that wont be glorious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i supposed it would be a year anyway but its now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aint you glad you are an animal betsy he walked down the driveway and before the girl had a chance to speak he said i wonder if i had not better carry those things into your room and arrange i can she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant lift the mattress and heavy covers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hold the door and tell he laid a big bundle on the floor opened it and took out the shoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know what that door was so i didnt that is a part of my arrangements for you said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is a closet with shelves for your covers and other things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are bare because i didnt know just what should be put on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the shoe box here in the corner ill put these in it he knelt and in a row set the shoes in the curly maple box and closed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there you are for all kinds of places and varieties of weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put in towels soaps brushes and everything i could think of and there is hot water ready for yourain water the girl followed and looked into a shining little bathroom with its white porcelain tub and wash bowl enamelled woodwork dainty green walls and white curtains and towels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could see no accessory she knew of that was missing and there were many things to which she never had been accustomed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester had gone back to the sunshine room and was kneeling on the floor beside the bundle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began opening boxes and handing her dresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are skirt coat and waist hangers on the hooks he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only got a few things to start on because i didnt know what you would like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of being so careful with that dress why dont you take it off and put on a common one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we will have something to eat and go to the top of the hill and watch while she hung the dresses and selected the one to wear he placed the mattress spread the padding and sheets and encased the pillow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he bent and pressed the springs with his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you will find that soft and easy enough for health he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the personal belongings i had that clerk put up for you are in that chest of drawers there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put the little boxes in the top and went down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can empty and arrange them tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just hunt out what you will need now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there should be everything a girl uses there somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told them to be very careful about that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the things are not right or not to your taste you can take them back as soon as you are rested and they will exchange them for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there is anything i have missed that you can think the girl turned toward him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you couldnt be making sport of me she said but man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you see that i dont know what to do with half you have here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw such things closely before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what they are for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how to use them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother would have known but i do not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fifty times ive tried to tell you that a room of my very own such a room as this will be when tomorrows sun comes in and these and these and these she turned from the chest of boxes to the dressing table bed closet and bath all these for me and you know absolutely nothing about mei get a big lump in my throat and the words that do come all seem so meaningless i am perfectly ashamed to say them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh man why do i thought it was about time to spring another why on me said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank god i am now in a position where i can tell you why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do it because you are the girl of my dream my mate by every law of heaven and earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all men build as well as they know when the one woman of the universe lays her spell on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did all this for myself just as a kind of expression of what it would be in my heart to do if i could do what id like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put on the easiest dress you can she stood with arms high piled with the prettiest dresses that could be selected hurriedly the tears running down her white cheeks and smiled through them at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there wouldnt be any of that liquid amber would there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does it really hit the spot ruth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he questioned as he handed her the glass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she heaped the dresses on the bed and took it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think it possibly can hurt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how soon will you be ready for you will when you see and smell it said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should taste the dishes i improvise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there wont be much tonight because i want you he went away and the girl removed her dress and spread it on the couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she bathed her face and hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she saw the discoloured cloth it proved that she had been painted and made her very indignant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet she could not be altogether angry for that flush of colour had saved the harvester from being pitied by his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood a long time before the mirror staring at her gaunt colourless face then she went to the dressing table and committed a crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she found a box of cream and rubbed it on for a foundation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she opened some pink powder and carefully dusted her cheeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am utterly ashamed she said to the image in the mirror but he has done so much for me he is so so i dont know a word big enoughthat i cant bear him to see how ghastly i am how little worth it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps the food better air and outdoor exercise will give me strength and colour soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until it does im afraid im going to help out all i can with this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is wonderful how it changes one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i really appear like a girl instead then she looked over the dresses selected a pretty white princesse slipped it on and went to the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the harvester would not have her there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seated her at the dining table beside the window overlooking the lake lighted a pair of his homemade candles in his finest sticks and placed before her bread butter cold meat milk and fruit and together they ate their first meal in their home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had known said the harvester granny moreland is a famous cook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is a southern woman and she can fry chicken and make some especial dishes to surpass any one i ever knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would have been id much rather have this and be by ourselves said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you can bank on it i would agreed the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance if any one were here i might feel restrained about telling you that you are exactly the beautiful flushed dream girl i have adored for months and your dress most becoming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are oh why did you say that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ive got to feel like a sneak or tell youand i didnt dont you ever tell me or any one else anything you dont want to said the harvester roundly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was fool enough to think you wouldnt notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know they were doing it but when it all washed off i looked so ghastly i almost frightened myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hunted through the boxes they put up for but dont all the daintiest women powder these days and consider it indispensable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clerk said so and ive noticed it mentioned in the papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bought yes just powder but man i put on a lot of cold cream first to stick the powder good and thick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well since youve told it is your conscience perfectly at ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are lovely and if you dont use enough powder to cover the paleness until your colour returns ill hold you and put it on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you feel better when you you are no such thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there hasnt a woman in ten thousand got any such rope of hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been seeing the papers on the hair question too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one will believe its real <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they think your hair is false when it is natural they wont be any more fooled when they think your colour is real and it isnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very soon it will be and no one need ever know the difference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you go on and fix up your level best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to see yourself appearing well will make you harvesterman said the girl gazing at him with wet luminous eyes for the sake of other women i could wish that all men had an oath to keep and had here is the place we adjourn to the moon cried the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know of anything that can cure a sudden accession of swell head like gazing at the heavens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one finds his place among the atoms naturally and instantaneously with the eyes on the night sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mists from the lake are cool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe there is one among my orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but upstairs with mothers clothing there are several shawls and shoulder capes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all of them were washed and carefully packed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would why not give it to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wouldnt she like me to wear her things better than to have them lying in moth the harvester looked at her and shook his head marvelling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell how pleased she would be he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could use them to help furnish the house and it wouldnt the harvester liked that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the washed things are in those boxes upstairs also some fine skins ive saved on the chance of wanting them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her dishes are in the bottom of the china closet there she was mighty proud of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the furniture and carpets were so old and abused i burned them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill he took the candle and climbed the stairs soon returning with a little white wool shawl and a big pink coverlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got this for her christmas one time he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shed he folded it around the girls shoulders and picked up the coverlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre never going to take that to the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took it in her hands to find a corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its one of the things that money cant buy or rather one that takes a mint of money to own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not manufactured any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the art store where i worked theyd give you fifty dollars for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not faded or worn a particle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be lovely in my room you mustnt take a ruth are you in earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i have them to help furnish with certainly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything you can find any way on earth you want it only in my room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is taboo as i told isnt the rug you had in the woods in the wagon yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing worth carrying away except what you have on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a big swamp back of our woods marsh in front were up here where we can see the drive and bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing possible from any direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never locked the cabin in my life except your room and that was because it was sacred a coon that might go shuffling across an opossum or a snake going to the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the path is broad and white and surely you you are indeed said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now see he indicated the hill sloping toward the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the path wound among massive trees between whose branches patches of moonlight filtered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around the lake shore and climbing the hill were thickets of bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water lay shining in the light a gentle wind ruffled the surface in undulant waves and on the opposite bank arose the line of big trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under a giant oak widely branching on the top of the hill the harvester spread the rug and held one end of it against the tree trunk to protect the girls dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he sat a little distance away and began to talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he mingled some sense with a quantity of nonsense and appreciated every hint of a laugh he heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day had been no amusing matter for a girl absolutely alone among strange people and scenes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything more foreign to her previous environment or expectations he could not imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he talked to prevent her from thinking and worked for a laugh as he laboured for bread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now we must go he said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there is the malaria i strongly suspect in your system this night air is none too good for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only wanted you to see the lake the first night in your new home and if it wont shock you i brought you here because this is my holy of holies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you guess why i wanted you to come if i wasnt so stupid with alternate burning and chills and so deadened to every proper sensibility i suppose i could she answered but im not brilliant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know unless it is because you knew it would be the loveliest place i ever saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely there is no other then would it seem strange to you asked the harvester going to the girl and gently putting his arms around her would it seem strange to you that a woman who once homed here and thought it the prettiest place on earth chose to remain for her eternal sleep rather he felt the girl tremble against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she used to say that she had a speaking acquaintance with every tree on our land and of them all she loved this big one the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she liked to come here in winter and feel the sting of the wind sweeping across the lake and in summer this was her place to read and to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so when she slept the unwaking sleep ruth i came here and made her bed with my own hands and then carried her to it covered her and she sleeps well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never have regretted her going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> life did not bring her joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she used to say that after her soul had fled if i would lay her here perhaps the big roots would reach down and find her and from her frail frame gather slight nourishment and then her body would live again in talking leaves that would shelter me in summer and whisper her love in winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all medicine woods this is the dearest spot to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the girl i do now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just to see the place and hear that is enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish oh to my you wish what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was wild to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would be you would be ungracious if you didnt ask anything that would give me the joy of pleasing you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long is it going to require for you to learn ruth that to make up for some of the difficulties life has brought you would give me more happiness than anything else could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth there is no reason why you should be actively she struggled from his arms and stood alone in white moonlight staring across the lake along the shore deep into the perfumed forest and then at the mound she now could distinguish under the giant tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly she went to him and with both shaking hands gripped his arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh she was a beautiful woman delicately reared and her heart was crushed and broken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the inch she went to a dreadful end i could not avert or allay and in poverty and grime i fought for a way to save her body from further horror and its all so dreadful i thought all feeling in me was dried and still but i am not quite calloused yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suffer it over with every breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is never entirely out of my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh man if only you would lift her from the horrible place she lies where briers run riot and cattle trample and the unmerciful sun beats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh if only youd lift her from it and bring her here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe it would take away some of the horror the shame and the heartache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe i could go to sleep without hearing the voice of her suffering if i knew she was lying on this hill under your beautiful tree close the dear mother you the harvester crushed the girl in his arms and shuddering sobs shook his big frame and choked his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth for gods sake be quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill go anywhere you tell me and bring her and she shall rest where the lake murmurs the trees shelter the winds sing and earth knows the sun only she stared at him with strained face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth child said the harvester i tell you id be happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at my side of this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im in search of bands to bind you to me and to this place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could you tell me a stronger than to have the mother you idolized lie here for her long sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why girl you cant know the deep and abiding joy it would give me to bring her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id feel i had you almost secure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where is she in that old unkept cemetery south of onabasha close here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i supposed she straightened and drew away from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not have paid even her fare and brought her here in the cheapest box the decency of man would allow him to make if her doctor had not given me the money i owe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now do you understand why i must earn and pay it myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> save for him it was charity or her delicate body to ruth the day you came to onabasha was she with in the express car said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straight to the baggage room where uncle henry was waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men brought and put her in his wagon and he drove with me to the place and other men lowered you poor girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time tomorrow night she shall sleep in luxury under this oak so help me god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i she was laughing in the moonlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh man i dont try said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will start early in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man whose land it is on can point me the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is probably the last one laid there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go to the room i made for you and sleep oh david <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here where its clean and cool beside the lake where leaves fall gently and i can come and sit close to her and bring flowers and she never will be alone for your dear mother is here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant thank you enough for thinking he half carried her down the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he made the cabin a glamour of light by putting candles in the sticks he had carved and placing them everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a lighting plant in the basement he said but i had not expected to use it until winter and i have no acetylene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> candles were our grandmothers lights and they are the best anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go bathe your face ruth and wash away all trace of tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put on the pink powder and in a few weeks you will have colour to outdo the wildest rose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must be as gay i will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i didnt know a thing on earth could make me happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know i really could be glad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh if the ice in my heart would melt and the wall break down and the girlhood ive before the lord it shall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it shall come with the fulness of joy right here in medicine woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill go right now and ill put on the blessed pink powder so thickly youll never know what is under it and soon it she was laughing as she left the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester restlessly walked the floor a few minutes and then sat with a notebook and began entering stems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the girl returned he brought the pillow from her bed folded the coverlet and she lay on them in the big swing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he covered her with the white shawl and while singing water sang its loudest katydids exulted over the delightful act of their ancestor and a million gauze winged creatures of night hummed against the screen in a voice soft and low he told her in a steady stream as he swayed her back and forth what each sound of the night was and how and why it was made all the way from the rumbling buzz of the june bug to the screech of the owl and the splash of the bass in the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all of it as it appealed to him was the story of steady evolution the natural processes of reproduction the joy of life and its battles and the conquest of the strong in nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at his hands every sound was stripped of terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the leaping bass was exulting in life the screeching owl was telling its mate it had found a fat mouse for the children the nighthawk was courting the big bull frogs booming around the lake were serenading the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not a thing to fear or a voice left with an unsympathetic note in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was half asleep when at last he helped her to her room set a pitcher of frosty clinking drink on her table locked her door and window screens inside spread belshazzars blanket on her porch and set his door wide open that he might hear if she called and then said good night and went back to his memorandum book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no bad beginning he muttered softly no bad beginning but id almost give my right hand if she hadnt in her room the exhausted girl slipped the pins from her hair and sank on the low chair before the dressing table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she picked up the shining silver backed brush and stared at the monogram r <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was he so sure as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dropped the brush and with tired hands pushed back the heavy braids <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she arose and going to the chest of drawers began lifting lids to find a night robe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she searched the boxes she found every dainty pretty undergarment a girl ever used and at last the robes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shook out a long white one slipped into it and walked to the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that stood as he had arranged it white clean and dainty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall there be nothing for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh he makes she stepped to the closet picked down a lavender silk kimona and drawing it over her gown she gathered it around her and opening the bathroom door she stepped into a little hall leading to the diningroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she entered the livingroom the harvester bent over his book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her step was very close when he heard it and turned his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant she touched his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester dropped the pencil and palm downward laid his hands on the table his promise strong in his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl slid a shaking palm under his chin leaned his head against her breast and dropped a sweet tearwet face on his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with all the strength of her frail arms she gripped him a second and then gave the kiss into which she tried to put all she could find no words to express <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester sat at the table in deep thoughts until the lights in the girls room were darkened and everything was quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he locked the screens inside and went into the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon flooded all the hillside until coarse print could have been read with keen eyes in its light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a restlessness born of exultation he could not allay or control was on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after this the dream would be effaced by reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he scarcely had dared hope for so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely it presaged the love with which she some day would come to him and crown his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked softly up and down the drive passing her windows unable to think of sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over and over he dwelt on the incidents of the day so inevitably he came to his promise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor overworked tired suffering girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will give her some comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe i will do the worst part of it he went to the cabin crept very close to one of her windows and listened intently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely no mortal awake could lie motionless so long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he patted belshazzar whispered watch boy watch for your life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then crossed to the dryhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside it he found a big roll of coffee sacks that he used in collecting roots and going to the barn he took a spade and mattock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he climbed the hill to the oak in the white moonlight laid off his measurements and began work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his heart was very tender as he lifted the earth and threw it into the tops of the big bags he had propped open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill line it with a couple of sheets and finish the edge with pond lilies and ferns he planned and ill drag this earth from sight and cover it with brush until i sometimes he paused in his work to rest a few minutes and then he stood and glanced around him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several times he went down the hill and slipped close to a window but he could not hear a sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his work was finished he stood before the oak scraping clinging earth from the mattock with which he had cut roots he had been compelled to remove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was tired now and he thought he would go to his room and sleep until daybreak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he turned the implement he remembered how through it he had found her and now he was using it in her service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he smiled as he worked and half listened to the steady roll of sound encompassing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cool breath swept from the lake and he wondered if it found her wet hot cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wild duck in the rushes below gave an alarm signal and it ran in subdued voice note by note along the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester gripped the mattock and stood motionless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wild things had taught him so many lessons he heeded their warnings instinctively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it was a mink or muskrat approaching the rushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> listening intently he heard a stealthy step coming up the path behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he soundlessly moved around the trunk of the big tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an instant more the night prowler stopped squarely at the head of the open grave and jumped back with an oath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood tense a second then advanced scratched a match and dropped it into the depths of the opening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that instant the harvester recognized henry jameson and with a spring landed between the mans shoulders and sent him face down headlong into the grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he snatched one of the sacks of earth and tipping it gripped the bottom and emptied the contents on the head and shoulders of the prostrate man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he dropped on him and feeling across his back took an ugly big revolver from a pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he swung to the surface and waited until henry jameson crawled from under the weight of earth and began to rise then at each attempt he knocked him down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he caught the exhausted man by the collar and dragged him to the path where he dropped him and stood gloating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> coming to execute your threat are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats the matter with my finishing you loading your carcass with a few stones into this sack there was no reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isnt it rather cold blooded to come sneaking when you thought id be asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think it would be henry jameson arose cautiously and faced the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is for the victim of a member of your family but i never dreamed id have the joy of planting any of you in it first even temporarily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i should have done was to fill in tread down and leave you at the jameson retreated a few steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester laughed and advanced the same distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now then he said explain what you are doing on my premises a few hours after your threat and armed with another revolver before i could return the one i took from you this afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must grow them on bushes at your place they seem so numerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are three things it might be mused the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might think to harm me but youre watched on that score and i dont believe youd enjoy the result sure to follow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might contemplate trying to steal ruths money again but well pass that up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might want to go through my woods to inform yourself as to what i have of value there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in all prob ability you are after me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester stepped toward the lake bank and jameson turning to watch him exposed a face ghastly through its grime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will end this right now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was rather busy this afternoon but i wasnt too hurried to take that little weapon of yours to the chief of police and tell him where and how i got it and what occurred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was to return it to you tomorrow with his ultimatum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i have added the history of tonight reinforced by another gun he will understand your intentions and know where you belong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should be confined but because your name is the same as the girls and there is of your blood in her veins ill give you one more chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill let you go this time but ill report you and deliver this implement to be added to your collection at headquarters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i tell you and ill tell them that if ever i find you on my jameson nodded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i should do is to plump you squarely into confinement as i could easily enough but thats not my way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going to let you off but you go knowing the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing more dont leave with any distorted ideas in your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw ruth the day she stepped from the cars in onabasha and i loved her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to court and marry her as any man would the girl he loves but you spoiled that with your woman killing brutality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i married her in onabasha this afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can see the records at the county clerks office and interview the minister who performed the ceremony if you doubt me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth is in her room comfortable as i can make her asleep and unafraid thank god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this grave is for her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl wants her lifted from the horrible place you put her and laid where it is sheltered and pleasant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ill see you off my land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the harvester following henry jameson went back over the path he had come until he reached and mounted the horse he had ridden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the harvester watched him jameson turned in the saddle and spoke for the second time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what will you give me in cold cash to tell you who the harvester leaped for the bridle and missed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jameson bent over the horse and lashed it to a run <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half way to the oak the harvester remembered the revolver but being unaccustomed to weapons he had forgotten it when he needed it most <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he replaced the earth in the sack and dragged it away then plunged into the lake and afterward went to bed where he slept soundly until dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first he slipped into the living room and wrote a note to the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he fed belshazzar and ate a hearty breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stationed the dog at her door gave him the note and went to the oak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he arranged everything neatly and as he desired and then hitching betsy he quietly guided her down the drive and over the road to onabasha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went to an undertaking establishment made all his arrangements and then called up and talked with the minister who had performed the marriage ceremony the previous day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun shining in her face awoke ruth and she lay revelling in the light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe it will colour me faster than the powder she thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how peculiar for him to say what he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always thought men detested it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he is not like any one else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lay looking around the beautiful room and wondering where the harvester was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then slowly and painfully she dragged her aching limbs from the bed and went to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dog was gone from the porch and she could not see the man at the stable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she selected a frock and putting it on opened the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have gone to keep my promise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are locked in with bel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please obey me and do not step outside the door until four oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then put on a pretty white dress and with the dog come to the bridge to meet me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you will not suffer and fret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put away your clothing arrange the rooms to keep busy or better yet lie in the swing and rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is food in the ice chest pantry and cellar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forgive me for leaving you today but i thought you would feel easier to have this over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am so glad to bring your mother here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope it will make you happy enough to meet us with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not forget the pink box until the reality comes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl went to the kitchen and found food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she offered to share with belshazzar but she could see from his indifference he was not hungry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she returned to the room flooded with light and filled with treasures and tried to decide how she would arrange her clothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spent hours opening boxes and putting dainty pretty garments in the drawers hanging the dresses and placing the toilet articles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> often she wearily dropped to the chairs and couches or gazed from door and windows at the pictures they framed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder why he doesnt want me to go outside she thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt be afraid in the least with bel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id just love to go across to that wonderful little river of singing water and sit in the shade but i wont open the door until four oclock when she thought of where he had gone and why the swift tears filled her eyes but she forced them back and resolutely went to investigate the diningroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then for two hours she was a home builder with a touch of that homing instinct found in the heart of every good woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first she looked where the harvester had said the dishes were and suddenly sat on the floor exulting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a quantity of old chipped and cracked white ware and some gorgeous baking powder prizes but there were also big blue green and pink bowls several large lustre plates and a complete tea set without chip or blemish two beautiful pitchers and a number of willow pieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she set the green bowl on the dining table the blue on the livingroom and took the pink herself while a beautiful yellow one she placed in the dining room window seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh if i only dared fill them with those lovely flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood in the window and gazed longingly toward the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what colour id like to put in each of them she said but i promised not to touch anything and the ones i want most i never saw before and im not to go out anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant see the sense in that when im not at all afraid but if he does this wonderful thing for me i must do what he asks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you really coming to this beautiful place she sank to the window seat and lay trembling but she bravely restrained the tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a time she remembered the upstairs and went to see the coverlets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she found a half dozen beautiful ones and smiled as she examined the stiffly conventionalized birds facing each other in the border designs and in one corner of each blanket she read woven in the cloth peter and john hartman wooster ohio she took a blue and a green one several fine skins from the fur box the harvester had told her about and went downstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it required all her strength to push the heavy tables before the fireplaces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spread papers on them to stand on and tacked a skin above each mantel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she set all of the candlesticks except those she wanted to use in the lower part of an empty bookcase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pair of black walnut she placed on the living room mantel together with a big blue plate a yellow one and an old brass candlestick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she admired the effect very much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spread the blue coverlet on the couch and arranged the blue bowl and some books on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there she hung a skin across a chair back or spread it in a wide window seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having exhausted all her resources she returned to the dining room spread a skin before the hearth and in each window seat set a pink and green lustre plate on the mantel and a pair of oak candlesticks and arranged the lustre tea set on the side table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pink coverlet she took for herself and after resting a time she was surprised on going back to the rooms to see how homelike they appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at three oclock she dressed and at almost four unlocked the screen called belshazzar to her side and slowly went down the drive to the bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had used the pink powder put on a beautiful white dress carefully arranged her hair and she wore the pearl ornament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once her fingers strayed to the pendant and she said softly i think both he and mother would like me to at the foot of the hill she stopped at a bench and sat in the shade waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belshazzar stretched beside her and gazed at her with questioning friendly dog eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl looked from singing water to the lake and up the hill to make sure it was real <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tried to quiet her quivering muscles and nerves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had asked her to meet him with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not have understood what it meant when he made the request <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there never would be any way to make him realize indeed why should he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had loved his mother deeply and yet he had said he did not grieve to lay her to rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then why should she sorrow for her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again life had been not only unkind but bitterly cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belshazzar arose and watched down the drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the gate and up the levee came a strange procession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first walked the harvester alone with bared head and he carried an arm load of white lilies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a carriage containing a man and several women followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came a white hearse with snowy plumes and behind that another carriage filled with people and betsy followed drawing men in the spring wagon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl arose and as she stepped to the drive she swayed uncertainly an instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is bringing then she lifted her head and with a smile on her lips she went to meet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she reached his side he tenderly put an arm around her and came on steadily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be as brave as she around the driveway and up the hill he half carried her to a seat he had placed under the oak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before her lay the whitelined grave and the harvester arranged his lilies around it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the teams stopped at the barn and men came up the hill bearing a white burden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind them followed the minister who yesterday had performed their marriage ceremony and after him a choir blessed are the dead who die in the lord but david panted the girl it was mean and sush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the location was high and dry and it has been only a short time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we wrapped her in white silk laid her on a soft cushion and pillow and housed her securely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> covered with white lilies slowly the casket sank into earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at its head stood the minister and as it began to disappear the white doves frightened by the strange conveyances at the stable came circling above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lifted a clear tenor and softly and purely he sang while at a wave of his hand the choir oh come angel band <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh come and around me stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he uttered a low benediction and singing the people turned and went downhill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester gathered the girl in his arms and carried her to the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laid her in his boat and taking the oars sent it along the bank in the shade and through cool green places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the overstrained girl covered her face and sobbed wildly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a time he began to talk to her gently and before she realized it she was listening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> death has been kinder to her than life ruth he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is lying as you saw her last i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we lifted her very tenderly wrapped her carefully and brought her gently as we could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now they shall rest together those little mothers of ours to whom men were not kind and in the long sleep we must forget as they have forgotten and forgive as no doubt they have forgiven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you want to take some lilies to them before we go to the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right there on your left the girl sat up dried her eyes and gathered the white flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the last vehicle crossed the bridge the harvester tied the boat and helped her up the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old oak stretched its wide arms above two little mounds both moss covered and scattered with flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl added her store and then went to the harvester and sank at his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply will not have that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come now i will bring you back he helped her to the veranda and laid her in the swing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat beside her while she rested and then they went into the cabin for supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon he had her telling what she had found and he was making notes of what was yet required to transform the cabin into a home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester left it to her to decide whether he should roof the bridge the next day or make a trip for furnishings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said he had better buy what they needed and then she could make the cabin homelike while he worked on the bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went through the rooms together and the girl suggested the furnishings she thought necessary while the harvester wrote the list <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following morning he was eager to have her company but she was very tired and begged to be allowed to wait in the swing so again he drove away and left her with belshazzar on guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had gone she went through the cabin arranging the furniture the best she could then dressed and went to the swinging couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so wide and heavy a light wind rocked it gently and from it she faced the fern and lily carpeted hillside the majesty of big trees of a thousand years and heard the music of singing water as it sparkled diamondlike where the sun rays struck its flow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across the drive and down the valley to the brilliant bit of marsh it hurried on its way to loon lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were squirrels barking and racing in the big trees and over the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they crossed the sodded space of lawn and came to the top step for nuts eating them from cunning paws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were living life according to the laws of their nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew that their sharp startling bark was not to frighten her but to warn straying intruders of other species of their kindred from a nest because the harvester had told her so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had said their racing here and there in wild scramble was a game of tag and she found it most interesting to observe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> birds of brilliant colour flashed everywhere singing in wild joy and tilted on the rising hedge before her hunting berries and seeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their bubbling spontaneous song was an instinctive outpouring of their joy over mating time nests young much food and running water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their social inquiring short cry was to locate a mate and call her to good feeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sharp wild scream of a note was when a hawk passed over a weasel lurked in the thicket or a black snake sunned on the bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she remembered these things and lay listening intently trying to interpret every sound as the harvester did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> birds of wide wing hung as if nailed to the sky or wheeled and sailed in grandeur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were searching the landscape below to locate a hare or snake in the waving grass or carrion in the fields <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wonderful exhibitions of wing power were their expression of exultation in life just as the song sparrow threatened to rupture his throat as he swung on the hedge and the red bird somewhere in the thicket whistled so forcefully it sounded as if the notes might hurt him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the lake bass splashed in a game with each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grebes chattered because they were very social <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ducks dived and gobbled for roots and worms of the lake shore and congratulated each other when they were lucky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> killdeer cried for slaughter in plaintive tones as their white breasts gleamed silverlike across the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they insisted on the death of their ancient enemies because the deer had trampled nests around the shore roiled the water spoiled the food hunting and had been wholly unmindful of the laws of feathered folk from the beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind the barn imperial cocks crowed challenges of defiance to each other and all the world because they once had worn royal turbans on their heads and ruled the forests even the elephants and lions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> happy hens cackled when they deposited an egg and wandered through their park singing the spring egg song unceasingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the barn ajax spread and exulted in glittering plumage and screamed viciously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sending a wireless plea to the forests of ceylon for a gray mate to come and share the ridge pole with him and help him wage red war on the sickening love making of the white doves he hated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything was beautiful some of it was amusing all instructive and intensely interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl wanted to know about the brown yellow and black butterflies sailing from flower to flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she watched big black and gold bees come from the forest for pollen and listened to their monotonous bumbling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her first humming bird poised in air and sipped nectar before her astonished eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was marvellous but more wonderful to the girl than anything she saw or heard was the fact that because of the harvesters teachings she now could trace through all of it the ordained processes of the evolution of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything was right in its way all necessary to human welfare and so there was nothing to fear but marvels to learn and pictures to appreciate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would have taken belshazzar and gone out but the harvester had exacted a promise that she would not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact was he could see that she was coming gradually to a sane and natural view of life and living things and he did not want some sound or creature to frighten her and spoil what he had accomplished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she swayed in the swing and watched and tried to interpret sights and sounds as he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before an hour she realized that she was coming speedily into sympathy with the wild life around her for instead of shivering and shrinking at unaccustomed sounds she was listening especially for them and trying to arrive at a sane version <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of the senseless roar of commerce manufacture and life of a city she was beginning to appreciate sounds that varied and carried the song of life in unceasing measure and absorbing meaning while she was more than thankful for the fresh pure air and the blessed godgiven light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to the girl that there was enough sunshine at medicine woods to furnish rays of gold for the whole world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bel she said to the dog standing beside her its a shame to separate you from the medicine man and pen you here with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a wonder you dont bite off my head and run away to find him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes gone to bring more things to make life beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to go with him but oh bel theres something dreadfully wrong with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was afraid id fall on the streets and frighten and shame him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im so weak i scarcely can walk straight across one of these big cool rooms that he has built for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can make everything beautiful bel a home rooms clothing grounds and lifeabove everything else he can make life beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes so splendid and wonderful with his wide understanding and sane interpretation and godlike sympathy and patience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why belshazzar he can do the greatest thing in all the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can make you forget that the grave annihilates your dear ones by hideous processes and set you to thinking instead that they come back to you in whispering leaves and flower perfumes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i didnt owe him so much that i ought to pay if this wasnt so alluringly beautiful id like to go to the oak and lie beside those dear women resting there and give my tired body to furnish sap for strength and leaves for music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can take its bitterest stingfrom death beland thats the most her voice became silent her eyes closed the dog stretched himself beside her on guard and it was so the harvester found them when he drove home from the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heaped his load in the diningroom stabled betsy carried the things he had brought where he thought they belonged and prepared food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she awakened she came to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you really mean that your heart is warming a indeed i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell you what a morning ive had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there have been such myriad things to see and hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i can right now said the harvester promptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it means two things so simple any little child can understandthe love of god and the evolution of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not precisely clear as to what i mean when i say god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know whether it is spirit matter or force it is that big thing that brings forth worlds establishes their orbits and gives us heat light food and water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to me that is god and his love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just that we are given birth sheltered provisioned and endowed for our work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evolution is the natural consequence of this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the plan steadily unfolding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were you i wouldnt bother my head over these questions they never have been scientifically explained to the beginning i doubt if they ever will be because they start with the origin of matter and that is too far beyond man for him to penetrate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just enjoy to the depths of your soulthats worship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be thankful for everythingthats praising god as the birds praise him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and do unto others thats all there is of love and religion combined in you should go before the world and tell every one no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt my vocation said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my work is to provide painkiller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe ruth that there is any one on the footstool who is doing a better job along that line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am boastfully proud of itjust of sending in the packages that kill fever refresh poor blood and strengthen weak hearts unadulterated honest weight fresh and scrupulously clean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my neighbours have a different name for it i call it a every one who understands must said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could help at that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel as if it would do more to wipe out the pain ive suffered and seen her endure than anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> man when i grow strong enough i want to help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe that i am going dont ever suppress your feelings ruth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be very bad for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will become wrought up and het up as granny moreland says and it will make you very ill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we drive the fever from your blood the ache from your bones the poison of wrong conditions from your soul and good healthy red corpuscles begin pumping through your little heart like a windmill you can stake your life youre going to love it here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the location and work are not all youre going to care for either honey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was not nominated in the bond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never agreed not to say things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i promised was not to do them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so as i said honey sit at this table and eat the food ive cooked and by that time the furniture van will be here and the men will unload and you shall reign on a throne and tell me where you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are much better than you were yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can talk and thats all thats necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rooms are ready for furniture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men will carry it where you want it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a decorator is coming to hang the curtains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by night we will be settled you can lie in the swing while i read to you a story so wonderful that the wildest fairy tale you ever eat all the red raspberries and cream bread and butter and drink all the milk you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres blood beefsteak and bones in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i was saying you have come here a stranger to a strange land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing is for you to understand and love the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before you can do that you should master the history of one tree just the same as you must learn to know and love me before your childlike trust in all mankind returns again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well the fates knew you were on the way coming trembling down the brink ruth so they put it into the heart of a great man to write largely of a wonderful tree especially for your benefit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after it had fallen he took it apart split it in sections and year by year spread out history for all the world to read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made a classic story filled with unsurpassed wonders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a pine of a thousand years close the age of our mother tree ruth and when we have learned from enos mills how to wrest secrets from the hearts of centuries we will climb the hill and measure our oak and then i will estimate and you will write and we will make a so would i said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a million other things i can think of that we can learn together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wont require long for me to teach you all i know and by that time your hand will be clasped in mine and our hearts will beat as one and you will give me a kiss every night and morning and a few during the day for interest and we will go on in life together and learn songs miracles and wonders until the old oak calls us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we will ascend the hill gladly and lie down and offer up our bodies and our children will lay flowers over our hearts and gather the herbs and paint the pictures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hear a van on the bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just you go to your room and lie down until i get things unloaded and where they belong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you and the decorator can make us home like and tomorrow we will begin to live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wont that that will do for this time said the harvester as he opened the door to her room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lie and rest until as he went to meet the men she could hear him singing for an hour heavy feet sounded through the cabin carrying furniture to different rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with a floor brush in one hand and a polishing cloth in the other the harvester tapped at her door and helped the girl upstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had divided the space into three large square sleeping chambers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in each he had set up a white iron bed a dressing table and wash stand and placed two straightbacked and one rocking chair all white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the walls were tinted lightly with green added to the plaster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a mattress and a stack of bedding on each bed and a large rug and several small ones on the floors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he led her to the rocking chair in the middle room where she could see through the open doors of the other two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said the harvester i didnt know whether the room with two windows toward the lake and one on the marsh or two facing the woods and one front was the guest chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed about an even throw whether a visitor would prefer woods or water so i made them both guest chambers and got things alike for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if we are entertaining two one cant feel more highly fine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see how it could be be sure you are right then go ahead quoted the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ill make the beds and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is white correct for sleeping it will said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white wash curtains are make them short mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rogers keep them off the floor advised the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and simpledont arrange any thing elaborate that will tire a woman to keep in order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whack them off the right length and pin how about that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am quite sure that is the very best thing to do said the girl and the curtains were hung while the mattress was placed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do i i would not said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would spread the pad and the counterpane and lay the sheets and pillows in the closet until they are wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they can be sunned of course said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had finished he spread a cover on the dressing table and laid out white toilet articles and grouped a white wash set with green decorations on the stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he brushed the floor spread a big green rug in the middle and small ones before the bed stand and table and coming out closed the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guest chamber with lake view is now ready for company announced the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeat the operation on the woods room finished also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do some people make work of things and string them out eternally and fuss so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> isnt this simple and easy yes if you can afford it said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have the goods the dealer has my check <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me ten minutes until the laughing girl could catch glimpses of him busy over beds and dresser floor and rugs then he came where she sat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woods guest chamber ready he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now we come to the interior apartment that from its view might be called the marsh room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aside from being two windows short it is exactly similar to the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it occurred to me that in order to make up for the loss of those windows and also because i may be compelled to ask some obliging woman to occupy it in case your health is precarious at any time and in view of the further fact that if any such woman could be found and would kindly and willingly care for us my gratitude would be inexpressible on account of all these things i got a shade the girl stared at him with blank face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see said the harvester this is a question of ethics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a person who disturbs your routine and interferes with important concerns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should any one be grateful for company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should time and money be lavished on visitors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you return the visit because its the only way to have back at them but why pamper them unnecessarily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now a good housekeeper that means more than words can express <end> <end> 
<start> <start> comfort kindness sanitary living care in illness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres to the prospective housekeeper of medicine woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rogers hang those ruffled embroidered curtains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observe that whereas mere guest beds are plain white this has a touch of brass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where guest rugs are floor coverings this is a work of art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where guest brushes are celluloid these are enamelled and the dresser cover is hand embroidered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me also call your attention to the chairs touched with gold cushioned for ease and a decorated pitcher and bowl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> watch the bounce of these springs and the thickness of this mattress and pad and notice that where guests however welcome get a down cover of sateen the lady of the house has silkaline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wont she prepare us a breakfast after a night in this david are you in earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no woman can enter my home when my necessities are so great i have to hire her to come and take the worst in the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after my wife she gets the best every time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever i need help the woman who will come and serve me is what id call the real guest of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where are your friends when trouble comes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it always brings a crowd on account of the excitement and there is noise and racing but if your soul is saved alive it is by a steady trained hand you pay to help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> friends come and go but a good housekeeper remains and is a business propositionone that if conducted rightly for both parties and on a strictly commonsense basis gives you living comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now that we have disposed of the guests that go and the one that remains we will proceed downward and arrange for david did you ever know any one who treated a no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i never knew any one who raised medicinal stuff for a living but im making a giltedged success of thats the bedrock of all the trouble on the earth interrupted the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are a nation and a part of a world that spends our time on seeming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our whole outer crust is seeming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we get beneath the surface and strike the being then we live as we are privileged by the almighty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think i give a tinker how anything seems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what concerns me is how it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doesnt seem possible to you to hire a woman to come into your home and take charge of its cleanliness and the food you eatthe very foundation of lifeand treat her as an honoured guest and give her the best comfort you have to offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cold room the old covers the bare floor and the cast off furniture are for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder as a rule she gives what she gets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dignifies her labour in the same ratio that you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait until we need a housekeeper and then gaze with awe on the one i will raise dont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come tell me how to make our they went downstairs together followed by the decorator and began work on the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl was placed on a couch and made comfortable and then the harvester looked around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that bundle there rogers is the curtains we bought for this room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you and my wife think they are not the decorator opened the package and took out curtains of tancoloured goods with a border of blue and brown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those are not expensive said the harvester but to me a window appears bare with only a shade so i thought wed try these and when they become soiled good idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a house fix these as you did those upstairs ordered the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put the no i am going to arrange these said the decorator all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first ill lay he cleared the floor spread a large rug with a rich brown centre and a wide blue border <end> <end> 
<start> <start> smaller ones of similar design and colour were placed before each of the doors leading from the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now for the hearth said the harvester i got this it certainly did and the girl and the decorator hastened to say so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester replaced the table and chairs and then sat on the couch at the girls feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i call this almost finished he remarked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all we need now is a bouquet and something on the walls and that is serious business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what goes on them usually remains for a long time and so it should be selected with none since she was my mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a picture of my mother when she was a pretty girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will select the best of yours and have them enlarged in those beautiful brown prints they make in these days and well frame one for each side of the mantel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that you can decorate the other walls as you see things you want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fifteen minutes gone we are ready to take up the line of march to the diningroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here are a half dozen tan brown and blue for this room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth you arrange the girl heaped four on the couch stood one beside the hearth and laid another in a big chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i dont know what you will think of this said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found it in a magazine at the library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plan was to have the floor furniture and casings of golden oak and the walls pale green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it said get yellow curtains bordered with green and a green rug with yellow figures so i got them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had green leather cushions made for the window seats and these pillows go on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hang the saffron curtains rogers and we will finish in good shape for dinner by six <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the way ruth when will you select your dishes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will take a big set to fill all these shelves and you shall have exactly what you oh no you cant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may live and work in the woods but i am not so benighted that i dont own and read the best books and magazines and subscribe for a few papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i patronize the library and see what is in the stores <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my money will buy just as much as any mans if i do wear khaki trousers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> save in deference to your ladyship i probably would have said pants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see how elite i can be if i try <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it not only extends to my wardrobe to a yaller and green diningroom but it takes in the chany as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have looked up that too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you want china cut glass silver cutlery and linen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you neednt think i dont know anything but how to dig in the dirt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been studying this especially come here said the girl making a place for him beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now let me tell you what i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are going to live in the woods and our home is a log with acetylene lights a furnace baths and hot and cold water interpolated the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl and the decorator laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyway said she if you are going to let me have what i would like id prefer a set of tulip yellow dishes with the dutch little figures on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what they cost but certainly they are not so expensive is that earnest or is it because you think i am it is what i want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything else is different why should we have dishes like city folk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id dearly love to have the dutch ones and a white cloth with a yellow border glass where it is necessary and silver knives that would be great all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you have got a priceless old lustre tea set there and your willow ware is as fine as i ever saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were you i wouldnt buy a dish with what you have great day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you tell me why my great grandmothers old pink and green the girl explained pink lustre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that set in the shop i knew in chicago would sell for from three to five hundred dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive seen one little pink and green pitcher like yours bring nine dollars there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youve not only got the full tea set but water and dip pitchers two bowls and two bread plates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are priceless because the secret of making them is lost they take on beauty with age and they were your great the harvester reached over and energetically shook hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth im so glad youve got them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now elucidate on my willow ware <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why have i willow ware and am not informed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did my ancestors buy better than they knew or worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is willow ware a crime for which i must hide my head or is it further riches thrust upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i had investigated the subject of proper dishes quite thoroughly but i am very certain i saw no mention of lustre or willow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought in my ignorance that lustre was a dress and willow a tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why is a blue bring that platter from the mantel ordered the the harvester obeyed and followed the finger that traced the design <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if loon lake couldnt go ahead of that it should be drained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and will you please tell me why this precious platter from which i have eaten much stewed chicken fried ham and in youthful days sopped the gravywill you tell me why this relic of my ancestors is called a willow plate when there are a majority of orange trees so extremely fruitful they have neglected to grow a leaf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why is it not an orange plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in plain sight of it two pagodas a summer house a watersweep and a pair of corpulent swallows you would have me believe that a couple are eloping in broad never <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a total absence of shadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each orange tree is conveniently split in halves so you can see to count the fruit accurately the birds are in flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only a swallow or a stork can fly in decorations either by day or by night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for any sake look at that elopment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he goes ahead carrying a cane she comes behind lugging the baggage another man with a cane brings up the rear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have been married ten years at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a proper elopement they forget there are such things as jewels and they always carry each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive often looked up the statistics and its the only authorized version <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i regard this treasure i grow faint when i remember with what unnecessary force my father bore down when he carved the ham <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill bet a cooky he split those orange trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now meill never dare touch knife to it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill always carve the meat on the broiler and gently lift it to this platter with a fork <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or am i not to be allowed not in a green and yellow room laughed the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill tell you what i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had a tea table to match the livingroom furniture and it sat beside the hearth and on it a chafing dish to cook in and the willow ware to eat from we could have little tea parties in there when we arent very hungry or to treat a visitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would help make that room homey and its wonderful how much willow ware have i got to bestow on you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose you show me all of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a guilty feeling arises in my breast and i fear oh man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt break or lose any of those show me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl arose and going to the cupboard he had designed for her china she opened it and set before him a teapot cream pitcher two plates a bowl a pitcher the meat platter and a sugar bowl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there were all of the cups saucers and plates i know where they would bring five hundred dollars she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ruth are you getting even with me for poking fun at them or are you in earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you really want a small black walnut table made not if you are too busy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could use it with beautiful effect and much pleasure and i cant tell you how proud the harvesters face flushed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have now finished furnishing a house i will go and take a peep at the engine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went into the kitchen and hearing the rattle of dishes the girl followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stepped in just in time to see him hastily slide something into his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he picked up a half dozen old white plates and saucers and several cups and started toward the evaporator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here honey he said turning you dont want to see the dryhouse just now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have terrific heat to do some rapid work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont be gone but a few minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid that wasnt very diplomatic he muttered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it savoured a little of being sent back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if what she says is right and she should know if they handle such stuff at that art store she will feel considerably he set his load at the door drew an old blue saucer from his pocket and made a careful examination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pulled some leaves from a bush and pushed a greasy cloth out of the saucer wiped it the best he could and held it to light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> saucer from your maternal ancestors tea set used for a grease dish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid id better sink it in the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shed feel worse to see it than never to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wish i could clean off the grease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could do better if it was hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can set it the harvester placed the saucer on the engine entered the dryhouse and closed the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the stifling air he began pouring seed from beautiful big willow plates to the old white ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about the time i have ruined you he said to a white plate some one will pop up and discover that the art of making you is lost and you are priceless and ill have been guilty of another blunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there are the dishes mother got with baking powder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know plenty well she prized them more than these blue ones or she wouldnt have saved them and used these for every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they set all so carefully taken care of and the girl doesnt even look at them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank heaven there are the four remaining plates all right anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ive got seed in some of the saucers one is there where on earth is the last one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found more saucers and set them with the plates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he passed the engine he noticed the saucer on it was bubbling grease literally exuding it from the particles of clay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took it up but it was so hot he dropped it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a deft sweep he caught it in air and shoved it on a tray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he danced and blew on his burned hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snatching out his handkerchief he rubbed off all the grease and imagined the saucer was brighter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a little is good more is better quoted the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wadding the handkerchief he returned the saucer to the engine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he slipped out dripping perspiration glanced toward the cabin and ran into the work room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first object he saw was a willow cup half full of red paint stuck and dried as if to remain forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took his knife and tried to whittle it off but noticing that he was scratching the cup he filled it with turpentine set it under a work bench turned a tin pan over it and covered it with shavings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few steps farther brought one in sight filled with carpet tacks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he searched everywhere but could find no more so he went to the laboratory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside his wash bowl at the door stood the last willow saucer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had used it for years as a soap dish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he scraped the contents on the bench and filled the dish with water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four cups held medicinal seeds and were in good condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lacked one although he could not remember of ever having broken it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gathering his collection he returned to the dryhouse to see how the saucer was coming on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again it was bubbling and he polished off the grease and set back the dish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he carried his treasures into the work room and went to the barn to feed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he was leaving the stable he uttered a joyous exclamation and snatched from a window sill a willow cup gummed and smeared with harness oil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say betsy the only name for this is luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if i only can clean them ill be ready to make her tea table whatever that is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my i hope she will stay away until he filled the last cup with turpentine set it with the other under the work bench stacked the remaining pieces polished the saucer he was baking and went to bring a dish pan and towel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew some water from the pipes of the evaporator put in the soap and carried it to the work room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he carefully washed and wiped all the pieces save two cups and one saucer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not know how long it would require to bake the grease from that but he was sure it was improving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought he could clean the paint cup but he imagined the harness oil one would require baking also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he stood busily working over the dishes with light step the girl came to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took one long look and understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned and swiftly went back to the cabin but her shoulders were shaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the harvester came in and explained that after finishing in the dryhouse he had gone to do the feeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he suggested that before it grew dark they should go through the rooms and see how they appeared and gather the flowers the girl wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so together they decided everything was clean comfortable and harmonized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they went to the hillside sloping to the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the diningroom the girl wanted yellow water lilies so the harvester brought his old boat and gathered enough to fill the green bowl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the livingroom she used wild ragged robins in the blue bowl and on one end of the mantel set a pitcher of saffron and on the other arrowhead lilies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for her room she selected big blushy mallows that grew all along singing water and around the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take a peep said the girl opening her door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had spread the pink coverlet on her couch and when she set the big pink bowl filled with mallows on the table the effect was exquisite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think perhaps thats a little frenchy she said and you may have to be educated to it but salmon she closed the door and went to find something to eat and then to the swing where she liked to rest look and listen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester suggested reading to her but she shook her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait until winter she said when the days are longer and cold and the snow buries everything and then read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now tell me about my hedge and the things the harvester went out and collected a bunch of twigs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he handed her a big evenly proportioned leaf of ovate shape and explained this is burning bush so called because it has pink berries that hang from long graceful stems all winter and when fully open they expose a flamered seed pod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was for this colour on gray and white days that i planted it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the woods i grow it in thickets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the root bark brings twenty cents a pound no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt set anything acutely poisonous in your hedge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted it to be a mass of bloom you were free to cut for the cabin all spring an attraction to birds in summer and bright with colour in winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to draw the feathered tribe i planted alder wild cherry and grapevines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bark is almost as beautiful as birch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i raise it for tonics and the birds love the cherries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this fernlike leaf is from mountain ash and when it attains a few years growth it will flame with colour all winter in big clusters of scarlet berries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i grow in the woods is a picture in snow time and the girl raised on her elbow and looked at the hedge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you must not confuse them with sumac <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the leaves are somewhat similar but the heads differ in colour and shape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sumac and buckeye you must not touch until we learn what they will do to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to some they are slightly poisonous to others not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt help putting in a few buckeyes on account of the big buds in early spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will like the colour if you are fond of pink and yellow in combination and the redbrown nuts in grayishyellow prickly hulls and the leaf clusters are beautiful but you must use care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put in witch hazel for variety and i like its appearance its mighty good medicine too so is spice brush and it has leaves that colour brightly and red berries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these selections were all made for a purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now here is wafer ash it is for music as well as medicine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have invoked all good fairies to come and dwell in this hedge and so i had to provide an orchestra for their dances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this tree grows a hundred tiny castanets in a bunch and when they ripen and become dry the wind shakes fine music from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes they are medicine that is the bark of the roots is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost without exception everything here has medicinal properties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tulip poplar will bear you the loveliest flowers of all and its root bark taken in winter makes a good fever how would it do to eat some of the leaves and see it wouldnt do at all said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are well enough fixed to allow doc to come now and he oh no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to see a doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will be all right very soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said i was you are said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will have you strong and well soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should have come in time for a dose of sassafras <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your hedge is filled with that because of its peculiar leaves and odour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put in dogwood for the white display around the little green bloom lots of alder for bloom and berries haws for blossoms and fruit for the squirrels wild crab apples for the exquisite bloom and perfume button bush for the buttons a few pokeberry plants for the colour and i tried some mallows but i doubt if its wet enough for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i set pecks of vine roots that are coming nicely and ferns along the front edge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give it two years and that hedge will make a picture that will do your eyes yes indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the woods are full of trees i have not used some because i overlooked them some i didnt want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hedge like this in perfection is the work of years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some species must be cut back some encouraged but soon it will be lovely and its colour and fruit attract every bird of the heavens and butterflies and insects of all varieties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i set several common cherry trees for the robins and some blackberry and raspberry vines for the orioles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bloom is pretty and the birds youll have will be a treat to see and hear if we keep away cats dont fire guns scatter food and move quietly among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with our water attractions added there is nothing impossible in the way of making there is one thing i dont understand said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wouldnt risk breaking the wing of a moth by keeping it when you wanted a drawing very much you dont seem to kill birds and animals that other people do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you almost worship a tree now how can you take a knife and peel the bark to sell or dig up beautiful bushes by perhaps ive talked too much about the woods said the harvester gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive longed inexpressibly for sympathetic company here because i feel rooted for life so i am more than anxious that you should care for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may have made you feel that my greatest interest is in the woods and that i am not consistent when i call on my trees and plants to yield of their store for my purposes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above everything else the human proposition comes first ruth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do love my trees bushes and flowers because they keep me at the fountain of life and teach me lessons no book ever hints at but above everything come my fellow men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all i do is for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my heart is filled with feeling for the things you see around you here but it would be joy to me to uproot the most beautiful plant i have if by so doing i could save you pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other men have wives they love as well little children they have fathered big bodies useful to the world that are sometimes crippled with disease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing i would not give to allay the pain of humanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not inconsistent to offer any growing thing you soon can replace to cure suffering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get that idea out of your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said you could worship at the shrine of the pokeberry bed you feel holier before the arrowhead lilies your face takes on an appearance of reverence when you see pink mallow blooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which of them would you have hesitated a second in uprooting if you could have offered it to subdue fever or pain in the oh i see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like everything else you make this different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you worship all this beauty and grace wrought by your hands but you carry your treasure to the market place for the good of suffering good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ruth girl while you are about it see if you cant combine the the following morning the girl was awakened by wheels on the gravel outside her window and lifted her head to see betsy passing with a load of lumber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shortly afterward the sound of hammer and saw came to her and she knew that singing water bridge was being roofed to provide shade for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dressed and went to the kitchen to find a dainty breakfast waiting so she ate what she could and then washed the dishes and swept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by that time she was so tired she dropped on a diningroom window seat and lay looking toward the bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could catch glimpses of the harvester as he worked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she watched his deft ease in handling heavy timbers and the assurance with which he builded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes he stood and with tilted head studied his work a minute then swiftly proceeded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he placed three tree trunks on each side for pillars laid joists across formed his angle and nailed boards as a foundation for shingling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> occasionally he glanced toward the cabin and finally came swinging up the drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he entered the kitchen softly but when he saw the girl in the window he sat at her feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh but this is a morning ruth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he radiated health and good cheer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tanned cheeks were flushed red with exercise and the hair on his temples was damp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have been breaking the rules he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the law that i am to do the work until you are well i am so perfectly useless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see so many things that i would enjoy doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh you can do everything else then no more attempts to stand over dishes and clean big floors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mustnt overwork yourself at anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the instant you feel in the least tired you must but man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im tired every minute with a dead dull ache and i dont feel as if i ever would be rested again the harvester took one of her hands felt its fevered palm fluttering wrist pulse and noticed that the brilliant red of her lips had extended to spots on her cheeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant work on that bridge any more until i drive in for some big nails he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mind being not at all if bel will stay with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill lie in the all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill help you out and to get settled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there anything you want oh but you are modest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i oh but you are extravagant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you see i have so much now i dont know what to do with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i almost forget the ache just lying and looking at all the wonderful riches that have come to me so suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant believe they wont vanish as they came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill look your papers over this morning said the judge and when i come from dinner will stop at the court house and examine the records and see whether theres anything we can get hold of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youll drop in around three or four oclock i may be able to give you an opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now george exclaimed the doctor well go back to the office for a spell and then ill take you home with me to luncheon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> green would never forgive me if i didnt bring you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strangers are rare birds in our society and when they come we make them welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our enemies may overturn our institutions and try to put the bottom rail on top but they cannot destroy our southern hospitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are so many carpetbaggers and other social vermin creeping into the south with the yankees trying to force the niggers on us that its a genuine pleasure to get acquainted with another real southern gentleman whom one can invite into ones house without fear of contamination and before whom one can express his feelings freely and be sure of perfect sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when judge straights visitors had departed he took up the papers which had been laid loosely on the table as they were taken out of tryons breast pocket and commenced their perusal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a note for five hundred dollars many years overdue but not yet outlawed by lapse of time a contract covering the transaction out of which the note had grown and several letters and copies of letters modifying the terms of the contract <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge had glanced over most of the papers and was getting well into the merits of the case when my dearest george i am going away for about a week to visit the bedside of an old friend who is very ill and may not live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not be alarmed about me for i shall very likely be back by the time you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge was unable to connect this letter with the transaction which formed the subject of his examination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> age had dimmed his perceptions somewhat and it was not until he had finished the letter and read it over again and noted the signature at the bottom a second time that he perceived that the writing was in a womans hand that the ink was comparatively fresh and that the letter was dated only a couple of days before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he still held the sheet in his hand it dawned upon him slowly that he held also one of the links in a chain of possible tragedy which he himself he became uncomfortably aware had had a hand in forging <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the walden womans daughter as sure as fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her brother goes by the name of warwick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has come to visit her sick mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my young client greens relation is her loveris engaged to marry heris in town and is likely to meet her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge was so absorbed in the situation thus suggested that he laid the papers down and pondered for a moment the curious problem involved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was quite aware that two races had not dwelt together side by side for nearly three hundred years without mingling their blood in greater or less degree he was old enough and had seen curious things enough to know that in this mingling the current had not always flowed in one direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certain old decisions with which he was familiar old scandals that had crept along obscure channels old facts that had come to the knowledge of an old practitioner who held in the hollow of his hand the honor of more than one family made him know that there was dark blood among the white peoplenot a great deal and that very much diluted and so long as it was sedulously concealed or vigorously denied or lost in the mists of tradition or ascribed to a foreign or an aboriginal strain having no perceptible effect upon the racial type <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such people were for the most part merely on the ragged edge of the white world seldom rising above the level of overseers or slavecatchers or sheriffs officers who could usually be relied upon to resent the drop of black blood that tainted them and with the zeal of the proselyte to visit their hatred of it upon the unfortunate blacks that fell into their hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one curse of negro slavery was and one part of its baleful heritage is that it poisoned the fountains of human sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under a system where men might sell their own children without social reprobation or loss of prestige it was not surprising that some of them should hate their distant cousins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were not in patesville half a dozen persons capable of thinking judge straights thoughts upon the question before him and perhaps not another who would have adopted the course he now pursued toward this anomalous family in the house behind the cedars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well here we are again as the clown in the circus remarks murmured the judge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten years ago in a moment of sentimental weakness and of quixotic loyalty to the memory of an old friend who by the way had not cared enough for his own children to take them away from the south as he might have done or to provide for them handsomely as he perhaps meant to doi violated the traditions of my class and stepped from the beaten path to help the misbegotten son of my old friend out of the slough of despond in which he had learned in some strange way that he was floundering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten years later the ghost of my good deed returns to haunt me and makes me doubt whether i have wrought more evil than good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder he mused if he will find her out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge was a man of imagination he had read many books and had personally outlived some prejudices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he let his mind run on the various phases of the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he found her out would he by any possibility marry her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not likely he answered himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he made the discovery here the facts would probably leak out in the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is something that a man might do in secret but only a hero or a fool would do openly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge sighed as he contemplated another possibility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had lived for seventy years under the old regime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man was a gentleman so had been the girls father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conditions were changed but human nature was the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would the young mans love turn to disgust and repulsion or would it merely sink from the level of worship to that of desire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would the girl denied marriage accept anything less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her mother hadbut conditions were changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes conditions were changed so far as the girl was concerned there was a possible future for her under the new order of things but white people had not changed their opinion of the negroes except for the worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the general belief was that they were just as inferior as before and had moreover been spoiled by a disgusting assumption of equality driven into their thick skulls by yankee malignity bent upon humiliating a proud though vanquished foe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the judge had had sons and daughters of his own he might not have done what he now proceeded to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the old mans attitude toward society was chiefly that of an observer and the narrow stream of sentiment left in his heart chose to flow toward the weaker party in this unequal conflict a young woman fighting for love and opportunity against the ranked forces of society against immemorial tradition against pride of family and of race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be the unwisest thing i ever did he said to himself turning to his desk and taking up a quill pen and may result in more harm than good but i was always from childhood in sympathy with the under dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is certainly as much reason in my helping the girl as the boy for being a woman she is less able to help herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dipped his pen into the ink and wrote the madamif you value your daughters happiness keep her at home for the next day or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this note he dried by sprinkling it with sand from a box near at hand signed with his own name and with a fine courtesy addressed to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having first carefully sealed it in an envelope he stepped to the open door and spied playing marbles on the street near by a group of negro boys one of whom the judge called by name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here billy he said handing the boy the note take this to mis molly walden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know where she livesdown on front street in the house behind the cedars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yas suh i knows de place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you come back and tell me what she says ill give you ten cents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on second thoughts i shall be gone to lunch so heres your money he added handing the lad the bit of soiled paper by which the united states government acknowledged its indebtedness to the bearer in the sum of ten cents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just here however the judge made his mistake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very few mortals can spare the spring of hope the motive force of expectation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy kept the note in his hand winked at his companions who had gathered as near as their awe of the judge would permit and started down the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as the judge had disappeared billy beckoned to his friends who speedily overtook him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the party turned the corner of front street and were safely out of sight of judge straights office the capitalist entered the grocery store and invested his unearned increment in gingerbread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the ensuing saturnalia was over billy finished the game of marbles which the judge had interrupted and then set out to execute his commission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had nearly reached his objective point when he met upon the street a young white lady whom he did not know and for whom the path being narrow at that point he stepped out into the gutter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reached the house behind the cedars went round to the back door and handed the envelope to mis molly who was seated on the rear piazza propped up by pillows in a comfortable rockingchair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she exclaimed weakly what is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a lettuh mam answered the boy whose expanding nostrils had caught a pleasant odor from the kitchen and who was therefore in no hurry to go away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its fuh you mam replied the lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she inquired turning the envelope over and over and examining it with the impotent curiosity of one who cannot read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tole me ter fetch it ter you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is you got a roasted tater you could gimme mam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill have aunt zilphy fetch you a piece of tater pone if youll hol on a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she called to aunt zilphy who soon came hobbling out of the kitchen with a large square of the delicacya flat cake made of mashed sweet potatoes mixed with beaten eggs sweetened and flavored to suit the taste and baked in a dutch oven upon the open hearth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy took the gratuity thanked her and turned to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mis molly was still scanning the superscription of the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder she murmured what old judge straight can be writin to me about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yas m answered the messenger looking back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laid the letter carefully on the chimney piece of the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon its somethin mo bout the taxes she thought or maybe somebody wants to buy one er my lots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> renall be back terreckly an she kin read it an find out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im glad my childen have ben to school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they never could have got where they are now if they hadnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mention has been made of certain addressed envelopes which john warwick on the occasion of his visit to patesville had left with his illiterate mother by the use of which she might communicate with her children from time to time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one occasion mis molly having had a letter written took one of these envelopes from the chest where she kept her most valued possessions and was about to inclose the letter when some one knocked at the back door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laid the envelope and letter on a table in her bedroom and went to answer the knock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind blowing across the room through the open windows picked up the envelope and bore it into the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mis molly on her return missed it looked for it and being unable to find it took another envelope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an hour or two later another gust of wind lifted the bit of paper from the ground and carried it into the open door of the cooper shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank picked it up and observing that it was clean and unused read the superscription <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his conversations with mis molly which were often about renathe subject uppermost in both their mindshe had noted the mystery maintained by mis molly about her daughters whereabouts and had often wondered where she might be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank was an intelligent fellow and could put this and that together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the envelope was addressed to a place in south carolina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was aware from some casual remark of mis mollys that rena had gone to live in south carolina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her sons name was john that he had changed his last name was more than likely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank was not long in reaching the conclusion that rena was to be found near the town named on the envelope which he carefully preserved for future reference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a whole year frank had yearned for a smile or a kind word from the only woman in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter his father had rallied him somewhat upon his moodiness after renas departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now s de time boy fer you ter be lookin roun fer some nice gal er yo own color watll preciate you an wont be shamed er you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre wastin time boy wastin time shootin at a mark outer yo range <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but frank said nothing in reply and afterwards the old man who was not without discernment respected his sons mood and was silent in turn while frank fed his memory with his imagination and by their joint aid kept hope alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later an opportunity to see her presented itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> business in the cooper shop was dull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a barrel factory had been opened in the town and had wellnigh paralyzed the coopers trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the best mechanic could hardly compete with a machine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one man could now easily do the work of peters shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an agent appeared in town seeking laborers for one of the railroads which the newly organized carpetbag governments were promoting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon inquiry frank learned that their destination was near the town of clarence south carolina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he promptly engaged himself for the service and was soon at work in the neighborhood of warwicks home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he was employed steadily until a certain holiday upon which a grand tournament was advertised to take place in a neighboring town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> work was suspended and foremen and laborers attended the festivities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank had surmised that rena would be present on such an occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had more than guessed too that she must be looked for among the white people rather than among the black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence the interest with which he had scanned the grand stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result has already been recounted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had recognized her sweet face he had seen her enthroned among the proudest and best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had witnessed and gloried in her triumph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seen her cheek flushed with pleasure her eyes lit up with smiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had followed her carriage had made the acquaintance of mimy the nurse and had learned all about the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when finally he left the neighborhood to return to patesville he had learned of tryons attentions and had heard the servants gossip with reference to the marriage of which they knew the details long before the principals had approached the main fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank went away without having received one smile or heard one word from rena but he had seen her she was happy he was content in the knowledge of her happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was doubtless secure in the belief that her secret was unknown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should he by revealing his presence sow the seeds of doubt or distrust in the garden of her happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sacrificed the deepest longing of a faithful heart and went back to the cooper shop lest perchance she might accidentally come upon him some day and suffer the shock which he had sedulously spared her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would n want ter skeer her he mused er make her feel bad an dats wat id mos lackly do ef she seed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shell be better off wid me outn de road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shell marry dat rich wite genteman he wont never know de diffencean be a wite lady ez she would a ben ef some ole witch had n changed her in her cradle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but maybe some time shell member de little nigger wat use ter nuss her wen she woz a chile an fished her outn de ole canal an would a died fer her ef it would a done any good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very generously too and with a fine delicacy he said nothing to mis molly of his having seen her daughter lest she might be disquieted by the knowledge that he shared the family secretno great mystery now this pitiful secret but more far reaching in its consequences than any bloodcurdling crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the taint of black blood was the unpardonable sin from the unmerited penalty of which there was no escape except by concealment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there be a dainty reader of this tale who scorns a lie and who writes the story of his life upon his sleeve for all the world to read let him uncurl his scornful lip and come down from the pedestal of superior morality to which assured position and wide opportunity have lifted him and put himself in the place of rena and her brother upon whom god had lavished his best gifts and from whom society would have withheld all that made these gifts valuable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to undertake what they tried to do required great courage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had they possessed the sneaking cringing treacherous character traditionally ascribed to people of mixed bloodthe character which the blessed institutions of a free slaveholding republic had been well adapted to foster among them had they been selfish enough to sacrifice to their ambition the mother who gave them birth society would have been placated or humbugged and the voyage of their life might have been one of unbroken smoothness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when rena came back unexpectedly at the behest of her dream frank heard again the music of her voice felt the joy of her presence and the benison of her smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was however a subtle difference in her bearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her words were not less kind but they seemed to come from a remoter source <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was kind as the sun is warm or the rain refreshing she was especially kind to frank because he had been good to her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if frank felt the difference in her attitude he ascribed it to the fact that she had been white and had taken on something of the white attitude toward the negro and frank with an equal unconsciousness clothed her with the attributes of the superior race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only her drop of black blood he conceived gave him the right to feel toward her as he would never have felt without it and if rena guessed her faithful devotees secret the same reason saved his worship from presumption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a smile and a kind word were little enough to pay for a lifes devotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the third day of renas presence in patesville frank was driving up front street in the early afternoon when he nearly fell off his cart in astonishment as he saw seated in dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greens buggy which was standing in front of the patesville hotel the young gentleman who had won the prize at the tournament and who as he had learned was to marry rena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank was quite certain that she did not know of tryons presence in the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank had been over to mis mollys in the morning and had offered his services to the sick woman who had rapidly become convalescent upon her daughters return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mis molly had spoken of some camphor that she needed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank had volunteered to get it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rena had thanked him and had spoken of going to the drugstore during the afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was her intention to leave patesville on the following day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ef dat man sees her in dis town said frank to himself derell be trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dont know hes here an ill bet he dont know shes here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then frank was assailed by a very strong temptation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if as he surmised the joint presence of the two lovers in patesville was a mere coincidence a meeting between them would probably result in the discovery of renas secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if shes found out argued the tempter shell come back to her mother and you can see her every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but franks love was not of the selfish kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put temptation aside and applied the whip to the back of his mule with a vigor that astonished the animal and moved him to unwonted activity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an unusually short space of time he drew up before mis mollys back gate sprang from the cart and ran up to mis molly on the porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no frank she went up town bout an hour ago to see the doctor an git me some camphor gum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank uttered a groan rushed from the house sprang into the cart and goaded the terrified mule into a gallop that carried him back to the market house in half the time it had taken him to reach mis mollys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder what in the worl s the matter with frank mused mis molly in vague alarm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ef he hadnt ben in such a hurry id a axed him to read judge straights letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when frank reached the doctors office he saw tryon seated in the doctors buggy which was standing by the window of the drugstore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank ran upstairs and asked the doctors man if miss walden had been there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yas replied dave she wuz here a little wile ago an said she wuz gwine downstairs ter de drugsto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would n be sprise ef youd fin her dere now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> green took tryon to his own house led up front street about a mile to the most aristocratic portion of the town situated on the hill known as haymount or more briefly the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hill had lost some of its former glory however for the blight of a four years war was everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after reaching the top of this wooded eminence the road skirted for some little distance the brow of the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> below them lay the picturesque old town a mass of vivid green dotted here and there with gray roofs that rose above the treetops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two long ribbons of streets stretched away from the hill to the faint red line that marked the high bluff beyond the river at the farther side of the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the markethouse tower and the slender spires of half a dozen churches were sharply outlined against the green background <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the face of the clock was visible but the hours could have been read only by eyes of phenomenal sharpness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around them stretched ruined walls dismantled towers and crumbling earthworksfootprints of the god of war one of whose temples had crowned this height <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for many years before the rebellion a federal arsenal had been located at patesville <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seized by the state troops upon the secession of north carolina it had been held by the confederates until the approach of shermans victorious army whereupon it was evacuated and partially destroyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the work of destruction begun by the retreating garrison was completed by the conquerors and now only ruined walls and broken cannon remained of what had once been the chief ornament and pride of patesville <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greens spacious brick house which occupied an ideally picturesque site was overgrown by a network of clinging vines contrasting most agreeably with the mellow red background <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a low brick wall also overrun with creepers separated the premises from the street and shut in a wellkept flower garden in which tryon who knew something of plants noticed many rare and beautiful specimens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not have the doctors memory with which to fill out the ladys cheeks or restore the lustre of her hair or the sparkle of her eyes and thereby justify her husbands claim to be a judge of beauty but her kindhearted hospitality was obvious and might have made even a plain woman seem handsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and her two fair daughters to whom tryon was duly presented looked with much favor upon their handsome young kinsman for among the people of patesville perhaps by virtue of the prevalence of scottish blood the ties of blood were cherished as things of value and never forgotten except in case of the unworthyan exception by the way which one need hardly go so far to seek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the patesville people were not exceptional in the weaknesses and meannesses which are common to all mankind but for some of the finer social qualities they were conspicuously above the average <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kindness hospitality loyalty a chivalrous deference to womenall these things might be found in large measure by those who saw patesville with the eyes of its best citizens and accepted their standards of politics religion manners and morals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor after the introductions excused himself for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> green soon left tryon with the young ladies and went to look after luncheon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her first errand however was to find the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lots of land and plenty of money if he is ever able to collect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a goodlooking fellow she mused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there you go again replied her husband shaking his forefinger at her in mock reproach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to a woman with marriageable daughters all roads lead to matrimony the centre of a womans universe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all men must be sized up by their matrimonial availability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we ought to ask him to stay with us while he is in town dont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes not married rejoined the doctor slyly but the next best thinghes engaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come to think of it said the lady im afraid we wouldnt have the room to spare and the girls would hardly have time to entertain him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but well have him up several times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you had sent me word he was coming id have had a better luncheon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> make him a salad rejoined the doctor and get out a bottle of the best claret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank god the yankees didnt get into my wine cellar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man must be treated with genuine southern hospitalityeven if he were a mormon and married ten times over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed he would not edthe idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hurry back to the parlor and talk to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls may want to primp a little before luncheon we dont have a young man every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beauty unadorned replied the doctor is adorned the most <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my profession qualifies me to speak upon the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are the two handsomest young women in patesville and the daughters dont you dare to say the word interrupted mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall never grow old while i am living with a big boy like you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i must go and make the salad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at dinner the conversation ran on the family connections and their varying fortunes in the late war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some had died upon the battlefield and slept in unknown graves some had been financially ruined by their faith in the lost cause having invested their all in the securities of the confederate government <end> <end> 
<start> <start> few had anything left but land and land without slaves to work it was a drug in the market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was offered a thousand acres the other day at twentyfive cents an acre remarked the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the owner is so landpoor that he cant pay the taxes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have taken our negroes and our liberties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be better for our grandchildren that the negroes are free but its confoundedly hard on us to take them without paying for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they may exalt our slaves over us temporarily but they have not broken our spirit and cannot take away our superiority of blood and breeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in time we shall regain control <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the negro is an inferior creature god has marked him with the badge of servitude and has adjusted his intellect to a servile condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will not long submit to his domination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i give you a toast sir the anglosaxon race may it remain forever as now the head and front of creation never yielding its rights and ready always to die if need be in defense of its liberties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with all my heart sir replied tryon who felt in this company a thrill of that pleasure which accompanies conscious superioritywith all my heart sir if the ladies will permit me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will join you they replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the toast was drunk with great enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now my dear george exclaimed the doctor to change one good subject for another tell us who is the favored lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a miss rowena warwick sir replied tryon vividly conscious of four pairs of eyes fixed upon him but apart from the momentary embarrassment welcoming the subject as the one he would most like to speak upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a good strong old english name observed the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is she tall and fair and dignified and stately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is tall dark rather than fair and full of tender grace and sweet humility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she should have been named rebecca instead of rowena rejoined miss mary who was well up in her scott <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell us something about her people asked mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greento which inquiry the young ladies looked assent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this meeting of the elect of his own class and kin warwick felt a certain strong illumination upon the value of birth and blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finding rena among people of the best social standing the subsequent intimation that she was a girl of no family had seemed a small matter to one so much in love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless in his present company he felt a decided satisfaction in being able to present for his future wife a clean bill of social health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her brother is the most prominent lawyer of clarence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they live in a fine old family mansion and are among the best people of the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite right my boy assented the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none but the best are good enough for the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must bring her to patesville some day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed looking at his watch i must be going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you stay with the ladies awhile or go back down town with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i had better go with you sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall have to see judge straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must come back to supper and well have a few friends in to meet you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must see some of the best people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctors buggy was waiting at the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they were passing the hotel on their drive down town the clerk came out to the curbstone and called to the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a man here doctor whos been taken suddenly ill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you come in a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you wait for me here george or will you drive down to the office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can walk the rest of the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think ill wait here doctor answered tryon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill step up to my room a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be back by the time youre ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was while they were standing before the hotel before alighting from the buggy that frank fowler passing on his cart saw tryon and set out as fast as he could to warn mis molly and her daughter of his presence in the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryon went up to his room returned after a while and resumed his seat in the buggy where he waited fifteen minutes longer before the doctor was ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they drew up in front of the office the doctors man dave was standing in the doorway looking up the street with an anxious expression as though struggling hard to keep something upon his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dat young omans ben heah agin suh an wants ter see you bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes in de drugstore dere now suh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added to himself fervently i membered dat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dis yer recommembance er mine is gwine ter git me inter trouble ef i don look out an dats a fac sho <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor sprang from the buggy with an agility remarkable in a man of sixty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just keep your seat george he said to tryon until i have spoken to the young woman and then well go across to straights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or if youll drive along a little farther you can see the girl through the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes worth the trouble if you like a pretty face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryon liked one pretty face moreover tinted beauty had never appealed to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more to show a proper regard for what interested the doctor than from any curiosity of his own he drove forward a few feet until the side of the buggy was opposite the drugstore window and then looked in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between the colored glass bottles in the window he could see a young woman a tall and slender girl like a lily on its stem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood talking with the doctor who held his hat in his hand with as much deference as though she were the proudest dame in town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her face was partly turned away from the window but as tryons eye fell upon her he gave a great start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely no two women could be so much alike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the height the graceful droop of the shoulders the swanlike poise of the head the well turned little earsurely no two women could have them all identical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the notion was absurd it was merely the reflex influence of his mornings dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she moved slightly it was renas movement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely he knew the gown and the style of hair dressing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rested her hand lightly on the back of a chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ring that glittered on her finger could be none other than his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl nodded in response and turning left the store <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryon leaned forward from the buggyseat and kept his eye fixed on the figure that moved across the floor of the drugstore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she came out she turned her face casually toward the buggy and there could no longer be any doubt as to her identity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when renas eyes fell upon the young man in the buggy she saw a face as pale as death with starting eyes in which love which once had reigned there had now given place to astonishment and horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood a moment as if turned to stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one appealing glance she gavea look that might have softened adamant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she saw that it brought no answering sign of love or sorrow or regret the color faded from her cheek the light from her eye and she fell fainting to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first effect of tryons discovery was figuratively speaking to knock the bottom out of things for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was much as if a boat on which he had been floating smoothly down the stream of pleasure had sunk suddenly and left him struggling in deep waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the full realization of the truth which followed speedily had for the moment reversed his mental attitude toward her and love and yearning had given place to anger and disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his agitation could hardly have escaped notice had not the doctors attention and that of the crowd that quickly gathered been absorbed by the young woman who had fallen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the time occupied in carrying her into the drugstore restoring her to consciousness and sending her home in a carriage tryon had time to recover in some degree his selfpossession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when rena had been taken home he slipped away for a long walk after which he called at judge straights office and received the judges report upon the matter presented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge straight had found the claim in his opinion a good one he had discovered property from which in case the claim were allowed the amount might be realized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge who had already been informed of the incident at the drugstore observed tryons preoccupation and guessed shrewdly at its cause but gave no sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryon left the matter of the note unreservedly in the lawyers hands with instructions to communicate to him any further developments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returning to the doctors office tryon listened to that genial gentlemans comments on the accident his own concern in which he by a great effort was able to conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor insisted upon his returning to the hill for supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor was solicitous felt his pulse examined his tongue pronounced him feverish and prescribed a sedative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryon sought refuge in his room at the hotel from which he did not emerge again until morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his emotions were varied and stormy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first he could see nothing but the fraud of which he had been made the victim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a negro girl had been foisted upon him for a white woman and he had almost committed the unpardonable sin against his race of marrying her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a step he felt would have been criminal at any time it would have been the most odious treachery at this epoch when his people had been subjugated and humiliated by the northern invaders who had preached negro equality and abolished the wholesome laws decreeing the separation of the races <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no southerner who loved his poor downtrodden country or his race the proud anglosaxon race which traced the clear stream of its blood to the cavaliers of england could tolerate the idea that even in distant generations that unsullied current could be polluted by the blood of slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very thought was an insult to the white people of the south <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for tryons liberality of which he had spoken so nobly and so sincerely had been confined unconsciously and as a matter of course within the boundaries of his own race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the southern mind in discussing abstract questions relative to humanity makes always consciously or unconsciously the mental reservation that the conclusions reached do not apply to the negro unless they can be made to harmonize with the customs of the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but reasoning thus was not without effect upon a mind by nature reasonable above the average <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryons race impulse and social prejudice had carried him too far and the swing of the mental pendulum brought his thoughts rapidly back in the opposite direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tossing uneasily on the bed where he had thrown himself down without undressing the air of the room oppressed him and he threw open the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cool night air calmed his throbbing pulses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moonlight streaming through the window flooded the room with a soft light in which he seemed to see rena standing before him as she had appeared that afternoon gazing at him with eyes that implored charity and forgiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he burst into tears bitter tears that strained his heartstrings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was his first love and he had lost her forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was worse than dead to him for if he had seen her lying in her shroud before him he could at least have cherished her memory now even this consolation was denied him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town clockwhich so long as it was wound up regularly recked nothing of love or hate joy or sorrowsolemnly tolled out the hour of midnight and sounded the knell of his lost love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lost she was as though she had never been as she had indeed had no right to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolutely determined to banish her image from his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see her again he could not it would be painful to them both it could be productive of no good to either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had felt the power and charm of love and no ordinary shook could have loosened its hold but this catastrophe which had so rudely swept away the groundwork of his passion had stirred into new life all the slumbering pride of race and ancestry which characterized his caste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much of this sensitive superiority was essential and how much accidental how much of it was due to the eversuggested comparison with a servile race how much of it was ignorance and selfconceit to what extent the boasted purity of his race would have been contaminated by the fair woman whose image filled his memoryof these things he never thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not influenced by sordid considerations he would have denied that his course was controlled by any narrow prudence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if rena had been white pure white for in his creed there was no compromise he would have braved any danger for her sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had she been merely of illegitimate birth he would have overlooked the bar sinister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had her people been simply poor and of low estate he would have brushed aside mere worldly considerations and would have bravely sacrificed convention for love for his liberality was not a mere form of words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the one objection which he could not overlook was unhappily the one that applied to the only woman who had as yet moved his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to be angry with her but after the first hour he found it impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a man of too much imagination not to be able to put himself in some measure at least in her placeto perceive that for her the step which had placed her in tryons world was the working out of natures great law of self preservation for which he could not blame her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for the sheerest accidentno rather but for a providential interferencehe would have married her and might have gone to the grave unconscious that she was other than she seemed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clock struck the hour of two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a shiver he closed the window undressed by the moonlight drew down the shade and went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell into an unquiet slumber and dreamed again of rena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must learn to control his waking thoughts his dreams could not be curbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that realm renas image was for many a day to remain supreme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dreamed of her sweet smile her soft touch her gentle voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all her fair young beauty she stood before him and then by some hellish magic she was slowly transformed into a hideous black hag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with agonized eyes he watched her beautiful tresses become mere wisps of coarse wool wrapped round with dingy cotton strings he saw her clear eyes grow bloodshot her ivory teeth turn to unwholesome fangs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a shudder he awoke to find the cold gray dawn of a rainy day stealing through the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rose dressed himself went down to breakfast then entered the writingroom and penned a letter which after reading it over he tore into small pieces and threw into the waste basket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a second shared the same fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giving up the task he left the hotel and walked down to dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked of the colored attendant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no suh replied the man hes gone ter see de young cullud gal wat fainted wen de doctah was wid you yistiddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryon sat down at the doctors desk and hastily scrawled a note stating that business compelled his immediate departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thanked the doctor for courtesies extended and left his regards for the ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the hotel he paid his bill and took a hack for the wharf from which a boat was due to leave at nine oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the hack drove down front street tryon noted idly the houses that lined the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he reached the sordid district in the lower part of the town there was nothing to attract his attention until the carriage came abreast of a row of cedartrees beyond which could be seen the upper part of a large house with dormer windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the gate stood a horse and buggy which tryon thought he recognized as dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaned forward and addressed the driver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you tell me who lives there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryon asked pointing to the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a callud oman suh the man replied touching his hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mis molly walden an her daughter rena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vivid impression he received of this house and the spectre that rose before him of a pale brokenhearted girl within its gray walls weeping for a lost lover and a vanished dream of happiness did not argue well for tryons future peace of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> renas image was not to be easily expelled from his heart for the laws of nature are higher and more potent than merely human institutions and upon anything like a fair field are likely to win in the long ran <end> <end> 
<start> <start> warwick awaited events with some calmness and some philosophyhe could hardly have had the one without the other and it required much philosophy to make him wait a week in patience for information upon a subject in which he was so vitally interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bad news being expected delay at least put off the evil day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of the week he received two lettersone addressed in his own hand writing and postmarked patesville n <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other in the handwriting of george tryon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he my dear sonfrank is writing this letter for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not well but thank the lord i am better than i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rena has had a heap of trouble on account of me and my sickness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could of dreamt that i was going to do so much harm i would of died and gone to meet my god without writing one word to spoil my girls chances in life but i didnt know what was going to happen and i hope the lord will forgive me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank knows all about it and so i am having him write this letter for me as rena is not well enough yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank has been very good to me and to rena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was down to your place and saw rena there and never said a word about it to nobody not even to me because he didnt want to do rena no harm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank is the best friend i have got in town because he does so much for me and dont want nothing in return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tells me not to put this in about him but i want you to and now about rena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she come to see me and i got better right away for it was longing for her as much as anything else that made me sick and i was mighty mizzable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had been here three days and was going back next day she went up town to see the doctor for me and while she was up there she fainted and fell down in the street and dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> green sent her home in his buggy and come down to see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he couldnt tell what was the matter with her but she has been sick ever since and out of her head some of the time and keeps on calling on somebody by the name of george which was the young white man she told me she was going to marry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems he was in town the day rena was took sick for frank saw him up street and run all the way down here to tell me so that she could keep out of his way while she was still up town waiting for the doctor and getting me some camphor gum for my camphor bottle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old judge straight must have knowed something about it for he sent me a note to keep rena in the house but the little boy he sent it by didnt bring it till rena was already gone up town and as i couldnt read of course i didnt know what it said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> green heard rena running on while she was out of her head and i reckon he must have suspicioned something for he looked kind of queer and went away without saying nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank says she met this man on the street and when he found out she wasnt white he said or done something that broke her heart and she fainted and fell down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am writing you this letter because i know you will be worrying about rena not coming back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it wasnt for frank i hardly know how i could write to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank is not going to say nothing about renas passing for white and meeting this man and neither am i and i dont suppose judge straight will say nothing because he is our good friend and dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> green wont say nothing about it because frank says dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greens cook nancy says this young man named george stopped with him and was some cousin or relation to the family and they wouldnt want people to know that any of their kin was thinking about marrying a colored girl and the white folks have all been mad since j <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thompson married his black housekeeper when she got religion and wouldnt live with him no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the rest of the connection are well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have just been in to see how rena is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is feeling some better i think and says give you her love and she will write you a letter in a few days as soon as she is well enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she bust out crying while she was talking but i reckon that is better than being out of her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope this may find you well and that this man of renas wont say nor do nothing down there to hurt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has not wrote to rena nor sent her no word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon he is very mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this letter while confirming warwicks fears relieved his suspense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he at least knew the worst unless there should be something still more disturbing in tryons letter which he now proceeded to john warwick esq <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear sirwhen i inform you as you are doubtless informed ere the receipt of this that i saw your sister in patesville last week and learned the nature of those antecedents of yours and hers at which you hinted so obscurely in a recent conversation you will not be surprised to learn that i take this opportunity of renouncing any pretensions to miss warwicks hand and request you to convey this message to her since it was through you that i formed her acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think perhaps that few white men would deem it necessary to make an explanation under the circumstances and i do not know that i need say more than that no one considering where and how i met your sister would have dreamed of even the possibility of what i have learned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might with justice reproach you for trifling with the most sacred feelings of a mans heart but i realize the hardship of your position and hers and can make allowances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would never have sought to know this thing i would doubtless have been happier had i gone through life without finding it out but having the knowledge i cannot ignore it as you must understand perfectly well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i regret that she should be distressed or disappointedshe has not suffered alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i need scarcely assure you that i shall say nothing about this affair and that i shall keep your secret as though it were my own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> personally i shall never be able to think of you as other than a white man as you may gather from the tone of this letter and while i cannot marry your sister i wish her every happiness and remain yours very truly george tryon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> warwick could not know that this formal epistle was the last of a dozen that tryon had written and destroyed during the week since the meeting in patesvillehot blistering letters cold cutting letters scornful crushing letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though none of them was sent except this last they had furnished a safetyvalve for his emotions and had left him in a state of mind that permitted him to write the foregoing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now while rena is recovering from her illness and tryon from his love and while fate is shuffling the cards for another deal a few words may be said about the past life of the people who lived in the rear of the flower garden in the quaint old house beyond the cedars and how their lives were mingled with those of the men and women around them and others that were gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for connected with our kind we must be if not by our virtues then by our vicesif not by our services at least by our needs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for many years before the civil war there had lived in the old house behind the cedars a free colored woman who went by the name of molly waldenher rightful name for her parents were freeborn and legally married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a tall woman straight as an arrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her complexion in youth was of an old ivory tint which at the period of this story time had darkened measurably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her black eyes now faded had once sparkled with the fire of youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> high cheekbones straight black hair and a certain dignified reposefulness of manner pointed to an aboriginal descent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tradition gave her to the negro race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless she had a strain of each with white blood very visibly predominating over both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in louisiana or the west indies she would have been called a quadroon or more loosely a creole in north carolina where fine distinctions were not the rule in matters of color she was sufficiently differentiated when described as a bright mulatto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mollys free birth carried with it certain advantages even in the south before the war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though degraded from its high estate and shorn of its choicest attributes the word freedom had nevertheless a cheerful sound and described a condition that left even to colored people who could claim it some liberty of movement and some control of their own persons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not citizens yet they were not slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no negro save in books ever refused freedom many of them ran frightful risks to achieve it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mollys parents were of the class more numerous in north carolina than elsewhere known as old issue free negroes which took its rise in the misty colonial period when race lines were not so closely drawn and the population of north carolina comprised many indians runaway negroes and indentured white servants from the seaboard plantations who mingled their blood with great freedom and small formality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> free colored people in north carolina exercised the right of suffrage as late as and some of them in spite of galling restrictions attained to a considerable degree of prosperity and dreamed of a still brighter future when the growing tyranny of the slave power crushed their hopes and crowded the free people back upon the black mass just beneath them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mis mollys father had been at one time a man of some means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an evil hour with an overweening confidence in his fellow men he indorsed a note for a white man who in a moment of financial hardship clapped his colored neighbor on the back and called him brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not poverty but wealth is the most potent leveler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in due time the indorser was called upon to meet the maturing obligation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the beginning of a series of financial difficulties which speedily involved him in ruin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he died prematurely a disappointed and disheartened man leaving his family in dire poverty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his widow and surviving children lived on for a little while at the house he had owned just outside of the town on one of the main traveled roads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the wayside near the house there was a famous deep well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slim barefoot girl with sparkling eyes and voluminous hair who played about the yard and sometimes handed water in a gourd to travelers did not long escape critical observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gentleman drove by one day stopped at the well smiled upon the girl and said kind words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came again more than once and soon while scarcely more than a child in years molly was living in her own house hers by deed of gift for her protector was rich and liberal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her poor relations could always find a meal in mollys kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not flaunt her prosperity in the worlds face she hid it discreetly behind the cedar screen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who wished could know of it for there were few secrets in patesville those who chose could as easily ignore it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were few to trouble themselves about the secluded life of an obscure woman of a class which had no recognized place in the social economy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she worshiped the ground upon which her lord walked was humbly grateful for his protection and quite as faithful as the forbidden marriage vow could possibly have made her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she led her life in material peace and comfort and with a certain amount of dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of her false relation to society she was not without some vague conception but the moral point involved was so confused with other questions growing out of slavery and caste as to cause her as a rule but little uneasiness and only now and then in the moments of deeper feeling that come sometimes to all who live and love did there break through the mists of ignorance and prejudice surrounding her a flash of light by which she saw so far as she was capable of seeing her true position which in the clear light of truth no special pleading could entirely justify <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for she was free she had not the slaves excuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with every inducement to do evil and few incentives to do well and hence entitled to charitable judgment she yet had freedom of choice and therefore could not wholly escape blame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let it be said in further extenuation that no other woman lived in neglect or sorrow because of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for what life gave her she returned an equivalent and what she did not pay her children settled to the last farthing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several years before the war when mis mollys daughter rena was a few years old death had suddenly removed the source of their prosperity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the household was not left entirely destitute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mis molly owned her home and had a store of gold pieces in the chest beneath her bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a small piece of real estate stood in the name of each of the children the income from which contributed to their maintenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> larger expectations were dependent upon the discovery of a promised will which never came to light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mis molly wore black for several years after this bereavement until the teacher and the preacher following close upon the heels of military occupation suggested to the colored people new standards of life and character in the light of which mis molly laid her mourning sadly and shamefacedly aside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had eaten of the fruit of the tree of knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the war she formed the habit of churchgoing and might have been seen now and then with her daughter in a retired corner of the gallery of the white episcopal church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon the ground floor was a certain pew which could be seen from her seat where once had sat a gentleman whose pleasures had not interfered with the practice of his religion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she might have had a better seat in a church where a northern missionary would have preached a sermon better suited to her comprehension and her moral needs but she preferred the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was shut out from this seeming paradise but she liked to see the distant glow of the celestial city and to recall the days when she had basked in its radiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not sympathize greatly with the new era opened up for the emancipated slaves she had no ideal love of liberty she was no broader and no more altruistic than the white people around her to whom she had always looked up and she sighed for the old days because to her they had been the good days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now not only was her king dead but the shield of his memory protected her no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> molly had lost one child and his grave was visible from the kitchen window under a small clump of cedars in the rear of the twoacre lot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for even in the towns many a household had its private cemetery in those old days when the living were close to the dead and ghosts were not the mere chimeras of a sick imagination but real though unsubstantial entities of which it was almost disgraceful not to have seen one or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had not the witch of endor called up the shade of samuel the prophet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had not the spirit of mis mollys dead son appeared to her as well as the ghostly presence of another she had loved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in mis mollys remaining son had grown into a tall slender lad of fifteen with his fathers patrician features and his mothers indian hair and no external sign to mark him off from the white boys on the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he soon came to know however that there was a difference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was informed one day that he was black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he denied the proposition and thrashed the child who made it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scene was repeated the next day with a variationhe was himself thrashed by a larger boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had been beaten five or six times he ceased to argue the point though to himself he never admitted the charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his playmates might call him black the mirror proved that god the father of all had made him white and god he had been taught made no mistakeshaving made him white he must have meant him to be white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the hall or parlor of his mothers house stood a quaintly carved black walnut bookcase containing a small but remarkable collection of books which had at one time been used in his hours of retreat and relaxation from business and politics by the distinguished gentleman who did not give his name to mis mollys childrento whom it would have been a valuable heritage could they have had the right to bear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the books were a volume of fieldings complete works in fine print set in double columns a set of bulwers novels a collection of everything that walter scottthe literary idol of the southhad ever written beaumont and fletchers plays cheek by jowl with the history of the virtuous clarissa harlowe the spectator and tristram shandy robinson crusoe and the arabian nights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on these secluded shelves roderick random don quixote and gil blas for a long time ceased their wanderings the pilgrims progress was suspended miltons mighty harmonies were dumb and shakespeare reigned over a silent kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an illustrated bible with a wonderful apocrypha was flanked on one side by volneys ruins of empire and on the other by paines age of reason for the collector of the books had been a man of catholic taste as well as of inquiring mind and no one who could have criticised his reading ever penetrated behind the cedar hedge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a history of the french revolution consorted amiably with a homespun chronicle of north carolina rich in biographical notices of distinguished citizens and inscriptions from their tombstones upon reading which one might well wonder why north carolina had not long ago eclipsed the rest of the world in wealth wisdom glory and renown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on almost every page of this monumental work could be found the most ardent panegyrics of liberty side by side with the slavery statistics of the statean incongruity of which the learned author was deliciously unconscious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when john walden was yet a small boy he had learned all that could be taught by the faded mulatto teacher in the long shiny black frock coat whom local public opinion permitted to teach a handful of free colored children for a pittance barely enough to keep soul and body together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the boy had learned to read he discovered the library which for several years had been without a reader and found in it the portal of a new world peopled with strange and marvelous beings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lying prone upon the floor of the shaded front piazza behind the fragrant garden he followed the fortunes of tom jones and sophia he wept over the fate of eugene aram he penetrated with richard the lionheart into saladins tent with gil blas into the robbers cave he flew through the air on the magic carpet or the enchanted horse or tied with sindbad to the rocs leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes he read or repeated the simpler stories to his little sister sitting wideeyed by his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had read all the booksindeed long before he had read them allhe too had tasted of the fruit of the tree of knowledge contentment took its flight and happiness lay far beyond the sphere where he was born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blood of his white fathers the heirs of the ages cried out for its own and after the manner of that blood set about getting the object of its desire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the corner of mackenzie street just one block north of the patesville markethouse there had stood for many years before the war on the verge of the steep bank of beaver creek a small frame office building the front of which was level with the street while the rear rested on long brick pillars founded on the solid rock at the edge of the brawling stream below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here for nearly half a century archibald straight had transacted legal business for the best people of northumberland county <end> <end> 
<start> <start> full many a lawsuit had he won lost or settled many a spendthrift had he saved from ruin and not a few families from disgrace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several times honored by election to the bench he had so dispensed justice tempered with mercy as to win the hearts of all good citizens and especially those of the poor the oppressed and the socially disinherited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rights of the humblest negro few as they might be were as sacred to him as those of the proudest aristocrat and he had sentenced a man to be hanged for the murder of his own slave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an oldfashioned man tall and spare of figure and bowed somewhat with age he was always correctly clad in a long frock coat of broadcloth with a high collar and a black stock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> courtly in address to his social equals superiors he had none he was kind and considerate to those beneath him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he owned a few domestic servants no one of whom had ever felt the weight of his hand and for whose ultimate freedom he had provided in his will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the longdrawnout slavery agitation he had taken a keen interest rather as observer than as participant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the heat of controversy increased his lack of zeal for the peculiar institution led to his defeat for the bench by a more active partisan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his was too just a mind not to perceive the arguments on both sides but on the whole he had stood by the ancient landmarks content to let events drift to a conclusion he did not expect to see the institutions of his fathers would probably last his lifetime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day judge straight was sitting in his office reading a recently published pamphlet presenting an elaborate proslavery argument based upon the hopeless intellectual inferiority of the negro and the physical and moral degeneration of mulattoes who combined the worst qualities of their two ancestral raceswhen a barefooted boy walked into the office straw hat in hand came boldly up to the desk at which the old judge was sitting and said as the judge looked up through sir i want to be a lawyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a singular desire from a singular source and expressed in a singular way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who the devil are you sir that wish so strange a thing as to become a lawyereverybodys servant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and everybodys master sir replied the lad stoutly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a matter of opinion and open to argument rejoined the judge amused and secretly flattered by this tribute to his profession though there may be a grain of truth in what you say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what is your name mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john walden sir answered the lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant imagine who you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its plain that you are a lad of good blood and yet i dont know whose son you can be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lad hesitated and flushed crimson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old gentleman noted his hesitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a wise son he thought that knows his own father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a bright lad and will have this question put to him more than once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill see how he will answer it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy maintained an awkward silence while the old judge eyed him keenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my fathers dead he said at length in a low voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had expected of course to tell who he was if asked but had not foreseen just the form of the inquiry and while he had thought more of his race than of his illegitimate birth he realized at this moment as never before that this question too would be always with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as put now by judge straight it made him wince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not read his fathers books for nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the judge in genuine surprise at this answer and you want to be a lawyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the situation was so much worse than he had suspected that even an old practitioner casehardened by years of life at the trial table and on the bench was startled for a moment into a comical sort of consternation so apparent that a lad less stouthearted would have weakened and fled at the sight of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> responded the boy trembling a little at the knees but stoutly holding his ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wants to be a lawyer and he asks me why not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> muttered the judge speaking apparently to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rose from his chair walked across the room and threw open a window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cool morning air brought with it the babbling of the stream below and the murmur of the mill near by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he glanced across the creek to the ruined foundation of an old house on the low ground beyond the creek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turning from the window he looked back at the boy who had remained standing between him and the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that moment another lad came along the street and stopped opposite the open doorway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the presence of the two boys in connection with the book he had been reading suggested a comparison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge knew the lad outside as the son of a leading merchant of the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the merchant and his wife were both of old families which had lived in the community for several generations and whose blood was presumably of the purest strain yet the boy was sallow with amorphous features thin shanks and stooping shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the youth standing in the judges office on the contrary was straight shapely and wellgrown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eye was clear and he kept it fixed on the old gentleman with a look in which there was nothing of cringing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was no darker than many a white boy bronzed by the southern sun his hair and eyes were black and his features of the highbred cleancut order that marks the patrician type the world over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what struck the judge most forcibly however was the lads resemblance to an old friend and companion and client <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he recalled a certain conversation archie im coming in to have you draw my will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some children for whom i would like to make ample provision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant give them anything else but money will make them free of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judges friend had died suddenly before carrying out this good intention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge had taken occasion to suggest the existence of these children and their fathers intentions concerning them to the distant relatives who had inherited his friends large estate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had chosen to take offense at the suggestion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one had thought it in shocking bad taste another considered any mention of such a subject an insult to his cousins memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a third had said with flashing eyes that the woman and her children had already robbed the estate of enough that it was a pity the little niggers were not slavesthat they would have added measurably to the value of the property <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge straights manner indicated some disapproval of their attitude and the settlement of the estate was placed in other hands than his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this son with his fathers face and his fathers voice stood before his fathers friend demanding entrance to the golden gate of opportunity which society barred to all who bore the blood of the despised race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he kept on looking at the boy who began at length to grow somewhat embarrassed under this keen scrutiny the judges mind reverted to certain laws and judicial decisions that he had looked up once or twice in his lifetime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the law the instrument by which tyranny riveted the chains upon its victims had revolted now and then against the senseless and unnatural prejudice by which a race ascribing its superiority to right of blood permitted a mere suspicion of servile blood to outweigh a vast preponderance of its own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why indeed should he not be a lawyer or anything else that a man might be if it be in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the judge speaking rather to himself than to the boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit down he ordered pointing to a chair on the other side of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he should ask a colored lad to be seated in his presence was of itself enough to stamp the judge as eccentric <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you want to be a lawyer he went on adjusting his spectacles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are aware of course that you are a negro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am white replied the lad turning back his sleeve and holding out his arm and i am free as all my people were before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lawyer shook his head and fixed his eyes upon the lad with a slightly quizzical smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said and you are not free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cannot travel without your papers you cannot secure accommodations at an inn you could not vote if you were of age you cannot be out after nine oclock without a permit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a white man struck you you could not return the blow and you could not testify against him in a court of justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are black my lad and you are not free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you ever hear of the dred scott decision delivered by the great wise and learned judge taney <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is too long to read rejoined the judge taking up the pamphlet he had laid down upon the lads entrance but it says in substance as quoted by this author that negroes are beings of an inferior order and altogether unfit to associate with the white race either in social or political relations in fact so inferior that they have no rights which the white man is bound to respect and that the negro may justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the law of this nation and that is the reason why you cannot be a lawyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may all be true replied the boy but it dont apply to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a negro is black i am white and not black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> black as ink my lad returned the lawyer shaking his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one touch of nature makes the whole world kin says the poet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somewhere sometime you had a black ancestor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one drop of black blood makes the whole man black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why shouldnt it be the other way if the white blood is so much superior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because it is more convenient as it isand more profitable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not right maintained the lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the old gentleman he is invading the field of ethics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will be questioning the righteousness of slavery next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid you wouldnt make a good lawyer in any event <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lawyers go by the lawsthey abide by the accomplished fact to them whatever is is right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the laws do not permit men of color to practice law and public sentiment would not allow one of them to study it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had thought said the lad that i might pass for white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are white people darker than i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge stopped for a moment struck by the absurdity of his arguing such a question with a mulatto boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he really must be falling into premature dotage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the proper thing would be to rebuke the lad for his presumption and advise him to learn to take care of horses or make boots or lay bricks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but again he saw his old friend in the lads face and again he looked in vain for any sign of negro blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the least earmark would have turned the scale but he could not find it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is another matter he repeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here you have started as black and must remain so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you wish to move away and sink your past into oblivion the case might be different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us see what the law is you might not need it if you went far enough but it is well enough to be within itliberty is sweeter when founded securely on the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took down a volume bound in legal calf and glanced through it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the color line is drawn in north carolina at four generations removed from the negro there have been judicial decisions to that effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i imagine that would cover your case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but let us see what south carolina may say about it he continued taking another book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think the law is even more liberal there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah the term mulatto he read is not invariably applicable to every admixture of african blood with the european nor is one having all the features of a white to be ranked with the degraded class designated by the laws of this state as persons of color because of some remote taint of the negro race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> juries would probably be justified in holding a person to be white in whom the admixture of african blood did not exceed one eighth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and even where color or feature are doubtful it is a question for the jury to decide by reputation by reception into society and by their exercise of the privileges of the white man as well as by admixture of blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i need not be black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy cried with sparkling eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no replied the lawyer you need not be black away from patesville <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have the somewhat unusual privilege it seems of choosing between two races and if you are a lad of spirit as i think you are it will not take you long to make your choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as you have all the features of a white man you would at least in south carolina have simply to assume the place and exercise the privileges of a white man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might of course do the same thing anywhere as long as no one knew your origin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the matter has been adjudicated there in several cases and on the whole i think south carolina is the place for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre more liberal there perhaps because they have many more blacks than whites and would like to lessen the disproportion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from this time on said the boy i am white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> softly softly my caucasian fellow citizen returned the judge chuckling with quiet amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are white in the abstract before the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may cherish the fact in secret but i would not advise you to proclaim it openly just yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must wait until you go awayto south carolina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and can i learn to be a lawyer sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me that you ought to be reasonably content for one day with what you have learned already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cannot be a lawyer until you are white in position as well as in theory nor until you are twentyone years old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are willing to come into my office sweep it keep my books dusted and stay here when i am out i do not care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the rest of the town you will be my servant and still a negro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you choose to read my books when no one is about and be white in your own private opinion i have no objection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you have made up your mind to go away perhaps what you have read may help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i hear a whisper of this from any other source out you go neck and crop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am willing to help you make a man of yourself but it can only be done under the rose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for two years john walden openly swept the office and surreptitiously read the law books of old judge straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he was eighteen he asked his mother for a sum of money kissed her good by and went out into the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his sister then a pretty child of seven cried because her big brother was going away he took her up in his arms gave her a silver dime with a hole in it for a keepsake hugged her close and kissed her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nev min sis he said soothingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be a good little gal an some o these days ill come back to see you and bring you somethin fine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in after years when mis molly was asked what had become of her son she would reply with sad hes gone over on the other side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we have seen he came back ten years later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many years before when mis molly then a very young woman had taken up her residence in the house behind the cedars the gentleman heretofore referred to had built a cabin on the opposite corner in which he had installed a trusted slave by the name of peter fowler and his wife nancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter was a good mechanic and hired his time from his master with the provision that peter and his wife should do certain work for mis molly and serve as a sort of protection for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frankly then mademoiselle i think you ought not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she began to look at the dresses of the two splendid ladies again a point on which having risked one conjecture i think i may risk another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while she was looking at the ladies she was seeing valentin de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he at all events was seeing her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put down the roughlybesmeared canvas and addressed a little click with his tongue accompanied by an elevation of the eyebrows to newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where have you been all these months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked mademoiselle noemie of our hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you took those great journeys you amused yourself well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very glad said mademoiselle noemie with extreme gentleness and she began to dabble in her colors again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was singularly pretty with the look of serious sympathy that she threw into her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin took advantage of her downcast eyes to telegraph again to his companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he renewed his mysterious physiognomical play making at the same time a rapid tremulous movement in the air with his fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was evidently finding mademoiselle noemie extremely interesting the blue devils had departed leaving the field clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me something about your travels murmured the young girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i went to switzerlandto geneva and zermatt and zurich and all those places you know and down to venice and all through germany and down the rhine and into holland and belgiumthe regular round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do you say that in frenchthe regular round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle nioche fixed her eyes an instant on bellegarde and then with a little smile i dont understand monsieur she said when he says so much at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you be so good as to translate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would rather talk to you out of my own head valentin declared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said newman gravely still in his bad french you must not talk to mademoiselle nioche because you say discouraging things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ought to tell her to work to persevere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we french mademoiselle said valentin are accused of being false flatterers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want any flattery i want only the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all i say is that i suspect there are some things that you can do better than paint said valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know the truthi know the truth mademoiselle noemie repeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dipping a brush into a clot of red paint she drew a great horizontal daub across her unfinished picture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without answering she drew another long crimson daub in a vertical direction down the middle of her canvas and so in a moment completed the rough indication of a cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the sign of the truth she said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two men looked at each other and valentin indulged in another flash of physiognomical eloquence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have spoiled your picture said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the only thing to do with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had sat looking at it all day without touching it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had begun to hate it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me something was going to happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like it better that way than as it was before said valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything i have is for sale said mademoiselle noemie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten thousand francs said the young girl without a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything that mademoiselle nioche may do at present is mine in advance said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it makes part of an order i gave her some months ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur will lose nothing by it said the young girl looking at valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she began to put up her utensils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall have gained a charming memory said valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father is coming to fetch me said mademoiselle noemie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had hardly spoken when through the door behind her which opens on one of the great white stone staircases of the louvre m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came in with his usual even patient shuffle and he made a low salute to the two gentlemen who were standing before his daughters easel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman shook his hands with muscular friendliness and valentin returned his greeting with extreme deference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the old man stood waiting for noemie to make a parcel of her implements he let his mild oblique gaze hover toward bellegarde who was watching mademoiselle noemie put on her bonnet and mantle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin was at no pains to disguise his scrutiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at a pretty girl as he would have listened to a piece of music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> attention in each case was simple good manners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche at last took his daughters paintbox in one hand and the bedaubed canvas after giving it a solemn puzzled stare in the other and led the way to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle noemie made the young men the salute of a duchess and followed her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said newman what do you think of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde reflectively she is very remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid she is a sad little adventuress said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a little onea great one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and valentin began to walk away slowly looking vaguely at the pictures on the walls with a thoughtful illumination in his eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing could have appealed to his imagination more than the possible adventures of a young lady endowed with the material of mademoiselle nioche <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is very interesting he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the deuce do you mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean from the artistic point of view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is an artist outside of her painting which obviously is execrable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont even think her very pretty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is quite pretty enough for her purposes and it is a face and figure on which everything tells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she were prettier she would be less intelligent and her intelligence is half of her charm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in what way asked newman who was much amused at his companions immediate philosophization of mademoiselle nioche does her intelligence strike you as so remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has taken the measure of life and she has determined to be somethingto succeed at any cost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her painting of course is a mere trick to gain time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is waiting for her chance she wishes to launch herself and to do it well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is one of fifty thousand so far as the mere ambition goes but i am very sure that in the way of resolution and capacity she is a rarity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in one gift perfect heartlessnessi will warrant she is unsurpassed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has not as much heart as will go on the point of a needle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she is one of the celebrities of the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said newman how far the artistic point of view may take a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in this case i must request that you dont let it take you too far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have learned a wonderful deal about mademoiselle noemie in a quarter of an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let that suffice dont follow up your researches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear fellow cried bellegarde with warmth i hope i have too good manners to intrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl is nothing to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact i rather dislike her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i like her poor old father and for his sake i beg you to abstain from any attempt to verify your theories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the sake of that seedy old gentleman who came to fetch her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and on newmans assenting ah no ah no he went on with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are quite wrong my dear fellow you neednt mind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i verily believe that you are accusing the poor gentleman of being capable of rejoicing in his daughters dishonor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> voyons said valentin who is he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is what he looks like as poor as a rat but very hightoned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i noticed him perfectly be sure i do him justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has had losses des malheurs as we say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is very lowspirited and his daughter is too much for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is the pink of respectability and he has sixty years of honesty on his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i know my fellowmen and my fellowparisians and i will make a bargain with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman gave ear to his bargain and he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would rather his daughter were a good girl than a bad one but if the worst comes to the worst the old man will not do what virginius did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if mademoiselle noemie makes a figure her papa will feel well we will call it relieved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she will make a figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old gentlemans future is assured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what virginius did but m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche will shoot miss noemie said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that i suppose his future will be assured in some snug prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not a cynic i am simply an observer valentin rejoined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle noemie interests me she is extremely remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there is a good reason in honor or decency for dismissing her from my thoughts forever i am perfectly willing to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your estimate of the papas sensibilities is a good reason until it is invalidated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i promise you not to look at the young girl again until you tell me that you have changed your mind about the papa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he has given distinct proof of being a philosopher you will raise your interdict <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to bribe him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh you admit then that he is bribable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he would ask too much and it would not be exactly fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will continue i suppose to see this interesting couple and you will give me the news yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said newman if the old man turns out a humbug you may do what you please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wash my hands of the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the girl herself you may be at rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what harm she may do to me but i certainly cant hurt her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me said newman that you are very well matched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are both hard cases and m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche and i i believe are the only virtuous men to be found in paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde in punishment for his levity received a stern poke in the back from a pointed instrument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turning quickly round he found the weapon to be a parasol wielded by a lady in green gauze bonnet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentins english cousins had been drifting about unpiloted and evidently deemed that they had a grievance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman left him to their mercies but with a boundless faith in his power to plead his cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three days after his introduction to the family of madame de cintre newman coming in toward evening found upon his table the card of the marquis de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the following day he received a note informing him that the marquise de bellegarde would be grateful for the honor of his company at dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went of course though he had to break another engagement to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was ushered into the room in which madame de bellegarde had received him before and here he found his venerable hostess surrounded by her entire family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room was lighted only by the crackling fire which illuminated the very small pink slippers of a lady who seated in a low chair was stretching out her toes before it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this lady was the younger madame de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre was seated at the other end of the room holding a little girl against her knee the child of her brother urbain to whom she was apparently relating a wonderful story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin was sitting on a puff close to his sisterinlaw into whose ear he was certainly distilling the finest nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis was stationed before the fire with his head erect and his hands behind him in an attitude of formal expectancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old madame de bellegarde stood up to give newman her greeting and there was that in the way she did so which seemed to measure narrowly the extent of her condescension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are all alone you see we have asked no one else she said austerely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very glad you didnt this is much more sociable said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good evening sir and he offered his hand to the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde was affable but in spite of his dignity he was restless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to pace up and down the room he looked out of the long windows he took up books and laid them down again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young madame de bellegarde gave newman her hand without moving and without looking at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may think that is coldness exclaimed valentin but it is not it is warmth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it shows she is treating you as an intimate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now she detests me and yet she is always looking at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder i detest you if i am always looking at you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman does not like my way of shaking hands i will do it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this charming privilege was lost upon our hero who was already making his way across the room to madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him as she shook hands but she went on with the story she was telling her little niece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had only two or three phrases to add but they were apparently of great moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she deepened her voice smiling as she did so and the little girl gazed at her with round eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the end the young prince married the beautiful florabella said madame de cintre and carried her off to live with him in the land of the pink sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there she was so happy that she forgot all her troubles and went out to drive every day of her life in an ivory coach drawn by five hundred white mice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor florabella she exclaimed to newman had suffered terribly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had had nothing to eat for six months said little blanche <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but when the six months were over she had a plumcake as big as that ottoman said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that quite set her up again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you very fond of children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was certain that she was but he wished to make her say it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like to talk with them she answered we can talk with them so much more seriously than with grown persons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is great nonsense that i have been telling blanche but it is a great deal more serious than most of what we say in society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you would talk to me then as if i were blanches age said newman laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were you happy at your ball the other night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you are talking the nonsense that we talk in society said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was my own fault if i was not happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ball was very pretty and every one very amiable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on your conscience said newman that you had annoyed your mother and your brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre looked at him a moment without answering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is true she replied at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had undertaken more than i could carry out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have very little courage i am not a heroine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said this with a certain soft emphasis but then changing her tone i could never have gone through the sufferings of the beautiful florabella she added not even for her prospective rewards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dinner was announced and newman betook himself to the side of the old madame de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the diningroom at the end of a cold corridor was vast and sombre the dinner was simple and delicately excellent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman wondered whether madame de cintre had had something to do with ordering the repast and greatly hoped she had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once seated at table with the various members of the ancient house of bellegarde around him he asked himself the meaning of his position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was the old lady responding to his advances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did the fact that he was a solitary guest augment his credit or diminish it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were they ashamed to show him to other people or did they wish to give him a sign of sudden adoption into their last reserve of favor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman was on his guard he was watchful and conjectural and yet at the same time he was vaguely indifferent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether they gave him a long rope or a short one he was there now and madame de cintre was opposite to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a tall candlestick on each side of her she would sit there for the next hour and that was enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dinner was extremely solemn and measured he wondered whether this was always the state of things in old families <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde held her head very high and fixed her eyes which looked peculiarly sharp in her little finelywrinkled white face very intently upon the tableservice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis appeared to have decided that the fine arts offered a safe subject of conversation as not leading to startling personal revelations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every now and then having learned from newman that he had been through the museums of europe he uttered some polished aphorism upon the fleshtints of rubens and the good taste of sansovino <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his manners seemed to indicate a fine nervous dread that something disagreeable might happen if the atmosphere were not purified by allusions of a thoroughly superior cast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what under the sun is the man afraid of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does he think i am going to offer to swap jackknives with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was useless to shut his eyes to the fact that the marquis was profoundly disagreeable to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had never been a man of strong personal aversions his nerves had not been at the mercy of the mystical qualities of his neighbors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here was a man towards whom he was irresistibly in opposition a man of forms and phrases and postures a man full of possible impertinences and treacheries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde made him feel as if he were standing barefooted on a marble floor and yet to gain his desire newman felt perfectly able to stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered what madame de cintre thought of his being accepted if accepted it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no judging from her face which expressed simply the desire to be gracious in a manner which should require as little explicit recognition as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young madame de bellegarde had always the same manners she was always preoccupied distracted listening to everything and hearing nothing looking at her dress her rings her fingernails seeming rather bored and yet puzzling you to decide what was her ideal of social diversion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman was enlightened on this point later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even valentin did not quite seem master of his wits his vivacity was fitful and forced yet newman observed that in the lapses of his talk he appeared excited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes had an intenser spark than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the effect of all this was that newman for the first time in his life was not himself that he measured his movements and counted his words and resolved that if the occasion demanded that he should appear to have swallowed a ramrod he would meet the emergency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde proposed to his guest that they should go into the smokingroom and he led the way toward a small somewhat musty apartment the walls of which were ornamented with old hangings of stamped leather and trophies of rusty arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman refused a cigar but he established himself upon one of the divans while the marquis puffed his own weed before the fireplace and valentin sat looking through the light fumes of a cigarette from one to the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant keep quiet any longer said valentin at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must tell you the news and congratulate you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my brother seems unable to come to the point he revolves around his announcement like the priest around the altar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are accepted as a candidate for the hand of our sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> murmured the marquis with a look of the most delicate irritation contracting the bridge of his high nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there has been a family council the young man continued my mother and urbain have put their heads together and even my testimony has not been altogether excluded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother and the marquis sat at a table covered with green cloth my sisterinlaw and i were on a bench against the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like a committee at the corps legislatif <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were called up one after the other to testify <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we spoke of you very handsomely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde said that if she had not been told who you were she would have taken you for a dukean american duke the duke of california <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said that i could warrant you grateful for the smallest favors modest humble unassuming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sure that you would know your own place always and never give us occasion to remind you of certain differences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all you couldnt help it if you were not a duke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were none in your country but if there had been it was certain that smart and active as you are you would have got the pick of the titles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this point i was ordered to sit down but i think i made an impression in your favor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde looked at his brother with dangerous coldness and gave a smile as thin as the edge of a knife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he removed a spark of cigarash from the sleeve of his coat he fixed his eyes for a while on the cornice of the room and at last he inserted one of his white hands into the breast of his waistcoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must apologize to you for the deplorable levity of my brother he said and i must notify you that this is probably not the last time that his want of tact will cause you serious embarrassment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i confess i have no tact said valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is your embarrassment really painful newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis will put you right again his own touch is deliciously delicate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin i am sorry to say the marquis continued has never possessed the tone the manner that belongs to a young man in his position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has been a great affliction to his mother who is very fond of the old traditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must remember that he speaks for no one but himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i dont mind him sir said newman goodhumoredly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what he amounts to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the good old times said valentin marquises and counts used to have their appointed fools and jesters to crack jokes for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nowadays we see a great strapping democrat keeping a count about him to play the fool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a good situation but i certainly am very degenerate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde fixed his eyes for some time on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother informed me he said presently of the announcement that you made to her the other evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i desired to marry your sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that you wished to arrange a marriage said the marquis slowly with my sister the comtesse de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the proposal was serious and required on my mothers part a great deal of reflection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she naturally took me into her counsels and i gave my most zealous attention to the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a great deal to be considered more than you appear to imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have viewed the question on all its faces we have weighed one thing against another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our conclusion has been that we favor your suit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother has desired me to inform you of our decision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she will have the honor of saying a few words to you on the subject herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile by us the heads of the family you are accepted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman got up and came nearer to the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will do nothing to hinder me and all you can to help me eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will recommend my sister to accept you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman passed his hand over his face and pressed it for a moment upon his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this promise had a great sound and yet the pleasure he took in it was embittered by his having to stand there so and receive his passport from m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of having this gentleman mixed up with his wooing and wedding was more and more disagreeable to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but newman had resolved to go through the mill as he imagined it and he would not cry out at the first turn of the wheel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was silent a while and then he said with a certain dryness which valentin told him afterwards had a very grand air i am much obliged to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i take note of the promise said valentin i register the vow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde began to gaze at the cornice again he apparently had something more to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must do my mother the justice he resumed i must do myself the justice to say that our decision was not easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such an arrangement was not what we had expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea that my sister should marry a gentlemanahin business was something of a novelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i told you you know said valentin raising his finger at newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the novelty has not quite worn away i confess the marquis went on perhaps it never will entirely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but possibly that is not altogether to be regretted and he gave his thin smile again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be that the time has come when we should make some concession to novelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had been no novelties in our house for a great many years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made the observation to my mother and she did me the honor to admit that it was worthy of attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear brother interrupted valentin is not your memory just here leading you the least bit astray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our mother is i may say distinguished for her small respect of abstract reasoning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you very sure that she replied to your striking proposition in the gracious manner you describe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know how terribly incisive she is sometimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt she rather do you the honor to say a fiddlestick for your phrases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are better reasons than that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other reasons were discussed said the marquis without looking at valentin but with an audible tremor in his voice some of them possibly were better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman but we are not also bigots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have no doubt that everything will be comfortable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman had stood listening to these remarks with his arms folded and his eyes fastened upon m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said with a sort of grim flatness of intonation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are not it will be your own fault i have everything to make me so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my brother means that with the lapse of time you may get used to the change and valentin paused to light another cigarette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked newman in the same tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> urbain said valentin very gravely i am afraid that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman does not quite realize the change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we ought to insist upon that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my brother goes too far said m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is his fatal want of tact again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is my mothers wish and mine that no such allusions should be made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we prefer to assume that the person accepted as the possible husband of my sister is one of ourselves and that he should have no explanations to make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a little discretion on both sides everything i think will be easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is exactly what i wished to say that we quite understand what we have undertaken and that you may depend upon our adhering to our resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin shook his hands in the air and then buried his face in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have less tact than i might have no doubt but oh my brother if you knew what you yourself were saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he went off into a long laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegardes face flushed a little but he held his head higher as if to repudiate this concession to vulgar perturbability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure you understand me he said to newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no i dont understand you at all said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact i think i had better not understand you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that wouldnt suit me at all you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to marry your sister thats all to do it as quickly as possible and to find fault with nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care how i do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not marrying you you know sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have got my leave and that is all i want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had better receive the last word from my mother said the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very good i will go and get it said newman and he prepared to return to the drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde made a motion for him to pass first and when newman had gone out he shut himself into the room with valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman had been a trifle bewildered by the audacious irony of the younger brother and he had not needed its aid to point the moral of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had wit enough to appreciate the force of that civility which consists in calling your attention to the impertinences it spares you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had felt warmly the delicate sympathy with himself that underlay valentins fraternal irreverence and he was most unwilling that his friend should pay a tax upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused a moment in the corridor after he had gone a few steps expecting to hear the resonance of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegardes displeasure but he detected only a perfect stillness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stillness itself seemed a trifle portentous he reflected however that he had no right to stand listening and he made his way back to the salon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his absence several persons had come in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were scattered about the room in groups two or three of them having passed into a small boudoir next to the drawingroom which had now been lighted and opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old madame de bellegarde was in her place by the fire talking to a very old gentleman in a wig and a profuse white neck cloth of the fashion of  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre was bending a listening head to the historic confidences of an old lady who was presumably the wife of the old gentleman in the neckcloth an old lady in a red satin dress and an ermine cape who wore across her forehead a band with a topaz set in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young madame de bellegarde when newman came in left some people among whom she was sitting and took the place that she had occupied before dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she gave a little push to the puff that stood near her and by a glance at newman seemed to indicate that she had placed it in position for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went and took possession of it the marquiss wife amused and puzzled him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know your secret she said in her bad but charming english you need make no mystery of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wish to marry my sisterinlaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man like you ought to marry a tall thin woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must know that i have spoken in your favor you owe me a famous taper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have spoken to madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may think it strange but my sisterinlaw and i are not so intimate as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i spoke to my husband and my motherinlaw i said i was sure we could do what we chose with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am much obliged to you said newman laughing but you cant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know that very well i didnt believe a word of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i wanted you to come into the house i thought we should be friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very sure of it said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you like madame de cintre so much perhaps you will not like me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are as different as blue and pink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you and i have something in common <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have come into this family by marriage you want to come into it in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only want to take madame de cintre out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well to cast your nets you have to go into the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our positions are alike we shall be able to compare notes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think of my husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a strange question isnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i shall ask you some stranger ones yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps a stranger one will be easier to answer said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh you get off very well the old comte de la rochefidele yonder couldnt do it better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told them that if we only gave you a chance you would be a perfect talon rouge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides you and i belong to the same camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by birth i am vieille roche a good little bit of the history of france is the history of my family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh you never heard of us of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ce que cest que la gloire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are much better than the bellegardes at any rate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont care a pin for my pedigree i want to belong to my time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a revolutionist a radical a child of the age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure i go beyond you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like clever people wherever they come from and i take my amusement wherever i find it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont pout at the empire here all the world pouts at the empire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i have to mind what i say but i expect to take my revenge with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde discoursed for some time longer in this sympathetic strain with an eager abundance which seemed to indicate that her opportunities for revealing her esoteric philosophy were indeed rare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hoped that newman would never be afraid of her however he might be with the others for really she went very far indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strong people le gens fortswere in her opinion equal all the world over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman listened to her with an attention at once beguiled and irritated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered what the deuce she too was driving at with her hope that he would not be afraid of her and her protestations of equality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in so far as he could understand her she was wrong a silly rattling woman was certainly not the equal of a sensible man preoccupied with an ambitious passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde stopped suddenly and looked at him sharply shaking her fan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see you dont believe me she said you are too much on your guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will not form an alliance offensive or defensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are very wrong i could help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman answered that he was very grateful and that he would certainly ask for help she should see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but first of all he said i must help myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he went to join madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been telling madame de la rochefidele that you are an american she said as he came up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her father went over with the french troops to help you in your battles in the last century and she has always in consequence wanted greatly to see an american <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she has never succeeded till tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are the first to her knowledgethat she has ever looked at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de la rochefidele had an aged cadaverous face with a falling of the lower jaw which prevented her from bringing her lips together and reduced her conversations to a series of impressive but inarticulate gutturals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she raised an antique eyeglass elaborately mounted in chased silver and looked at newman from head to foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she said something to which he listened deferentially but which he completely failed to understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de la rochefidele says that she is convinced that she must have seen americans without knowing it madame de cintre explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman thought it probable she had seen a great many things without knowing it and the old lady again addressing herself to utterance declaredas interpreted by madame de cintre that she wished she had known it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this moment the old gentleman who had been talking to the elder madame de bellegarde drew near leading the marquise on his arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife pointed out newman to him apparently explaining his remarkable origin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de la rochefidele whose old age was rosy and rotund spoke very neatly and clearly almost as prettily newman thought as m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had been enlightened he turned to newman with an inimitable elderly grace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur is by no means the first american that i have seen he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost the first person i ever sawto notice himwas an american <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i was very young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was received very well in our monde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg he will offer his arm into the other room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could have offered no higher privilege to dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman complying with madame de bellegardes request perceived that her two sons had returned to the drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he scanned their faces an instant for traces of the scene that had followed his separation from them but the marquise seemed neither more nor less frigidly grand than usual and valentin was kissing ladies hands with at least his habitual air of selfabandonment to the act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde gave a glance at her eldest son and by the time she had crossed the threshold of her boudoir he was at her side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room was now empty and offered a sufficient degree of privacy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady disengaged herself from newmans arm and rested her hand on the arm of the marquis and in this position she stood a moment holding her head high and biting her small underlip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid the picture was lost upon newman but madame de bellegarde was in fact at this moment a striking image of the dignity which even in the case of a little timeshrunken old ladymay reside in the habit of unquestioned authority and the absoluteness of a social theory favorable to yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my son has spoken to you as i desired she said and you understand that we shall not interfere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest will lie with yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde told me several things i didnt understand said newman but i made out that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will leave me open field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish to add a word that my son probably did not feel at liberty to say the marquise rejoined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must say it for my own peace of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are stretching a point we are doing you a great favor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh your son said it very well didnt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not so well as my mother declared the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can only repeati am much obliged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is proper i should tell you madame de bellegarde went on that i am very proud and that i hold my head very high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may be wrong but i am too old to change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least i know it and i dont pretend to anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont flatter yourself that my daughter is not proud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is proud in her own waya somewhat different way from mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will have to make your terms with that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even valentin is proud if you touch the right spotor the wrong one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> urbain is proud that you see for yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i think he is a little too proud but i wouldnt change him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is the best of my children he cleaves to his old mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have said enough to show you that we are all proud together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is well that you should know the sort of people you have come among <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said newman i can only say in return that i am not proud i shant mind you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you speak as if you intended to be very disagreeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall not enjoy having my daughter marry you and i shall not pretend to enjoy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont mind that so much the better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you stick to your own side of the contract we shall not quarrel that is all i ask of you said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep your hands off and give me an open field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very much in earnest and there is not the slightest danger of my getting discouraged or backing out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will have me constantly before your eyes if you dont like it i am sorry for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will do for your daughter if she will accept me everything that a man can do for a woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am happy to tell you that as a promisea pledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i consider that on your side you make me an equal pledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will not back out eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what you mean by backing out said the marquise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it suggests a movement of which i think no bellegarde has ever been guilty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our word is our word said urbain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well now said newman i am very glad you are so proud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it makes me believe that you will keep it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquise was silent a moment and then suddenly i shall always be polite to you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman she declared but decidedly i shall never like you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont be too sure said newman laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am so sure that i will ask you to take me back to my armchair without the least fear of having my sentiments modified by the service you render me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and madame de bellegarde took his arm and returned to the salon and to her customary place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de la rochefidele and his wife were preparing to take their leave and madame de cintres interview with the mumbling old lady was at an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood looking about her asking herself apparently to whom she should next speak when newman came up to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your mother has given me leavevery solemnlyto come here often he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall be glad to see you she answered simply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you probably think it very strange that there should be such a solemnity as you sayabout your coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you remember what my brother valentin said the first time you came to see methat we were a strange strange family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not the first time i came but the second said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin annoyed me at the time but now i know you better i may tell you he was right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you come often you will see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and madame de cintre turned away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman watched her a while talking with other people and then he took his leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook hands last with valentin de bellegarde who came out with him to the top of the staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you have got your permit said valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you liked the process <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like your sister more than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dont worry your brother any more for my sake newman added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid he came down on you in the smokingroom after i went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when my brother comes down on me said valentin he falls hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a peculiar way of receiving him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must say he continued that they came up to the mark much sooner than i expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont understand it they must have had to turn the screw pretty tight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a tribute to your millions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its the most precious one they have ever received said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was turning away when valentin stopped him looking at him with a brilliant softlycynical glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like to know whether within a few days you have seen your venerable friend m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was yesterday at my rooms newman answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt see the muzzle of a pistol sticking out of his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought he seemed rather cheerful for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am delighted to hear it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle noemie has thrown her cap over the mill as we say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has left the paternal domicile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont brandish your tomahawk at that rate i have not seen her nor communicated with her since that day at the louvre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> andromeda has found another perseus than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my information is exact on such matters it always is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose that now you will raise your protest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his tone found no echo in that in which valentin with his hand on the door to return to his mothers apartment exclaimed but i shall see her now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is very remarkable she is very remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman kept his promise or his menace of going often to the rue de luniversite and during the next six weeks he saw madame de cintre more times than he could have numbered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flattered himself that he was not in love but his biographer may be supposed to know better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he claimed at least none of the exemptions and emoluments of the romantic passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> love he believed made a fool of a man and his present emotion was not folly but wisdom wisdom sound serene welldirected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he felt was an intense allconsuming tenderness which had for its object an extraordinarily graceful and delicate and at the same time impressive woman who lived in a large gray house on the left bank of the seine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this tenderness turned very often into a positive heartache a sign in which certainly newman ought to have read the appellation which science has conferred upon his sentiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the heart has a heavy weight upon it it hardly matters whether the weight be of gold or of lead when at any rate happiness passes into that place in which it becomes identical with pain a man may admit that the reign of wisdom is temporarily suspended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman wished madame de cintre so well that nothing he could think of doing for her in the future rose to the high standard which his present mood had set itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to him so felicitous a product of nature and circumstance that his invention musing on future combinations was constantly catching its breath with the fear of stumbling into some brutal compression or mutilation of her beautiful personal harmony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is what i mean by newmans tenderness madame de cintre pleased him so exactly as she was that his desire to interpose between her and the troubles of life had the quality of a young mothers eagerness to protect the sleep of her firstborn child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman was simply charmed and he handled his charm as if it were a musicbox which would stop if one shook it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there can be no better proof of the hankering epicure that is hidden in every mans temperament waiting for a signal from some divine confederate that he may safely peep out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman at last was enjoying purely freely deeply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certain of madame de cintres personal qualitiesthe luminous sweetness of her eyes the delicate mobility of her face the deep liquidity of her voicefilled all his consciousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a rosecrowned greek of old gazing at a marble goddess with his whole bright intellect resting satisfied in the act could not have been a more complete embodiment of the wisdom that loses itself in the enjoyment of quiet harmonies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made no violent love to herno sentimental speeches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never trespassed on what she had made him understand was for the present forbidden ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had nevertheless a comfortable sense that she knew better from day to day how much he admired her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though in general he was no great talker he talked much and he succeeded perfectly in making her say many things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not afraid of boring her either by his discourse or by his silence and whether or no he did occasionally bore her it is probable that on the whole she liked him only the better for his absense of embarrassed scruples <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her visitors coming in often while newman sat there found a tall lean silent man in a halflounging attitude who laughed out sometimes when no one had meant to be droll and remained grave in the presence of calculated witticisms for appreciation of which he had apparently not the proper culture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be confessed that the number of subjects upon which newman had no ideas was extremely large and it must be added that as regards those subjects upon which he was without ideas he was also perfectly without words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had little of the small change of conversation and his stock of readymade formulas and phrases was the scantiest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the other hand he had plenty of attention to bestow and his estimate of the importance of a topic did not depend upon the number of clever things he could say about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he himself was almost never bored and there was no man with whom it would have been a greater mistake to suppose that silence meant displeasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what it was that entertained him during some of his speechless sessions i must however confess myself unable to determine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know in a general way that a great many things which were old stories to a great many people had the charm of novelty to him but a complete list of his new impressions would probably contain a number of surprises for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told madame de cintre a hundred long stories he explained to her in talking of the united states the working of various local institutions and mercantile customs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judging by the sequel she was interested but one would not have been sure of it beforehand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as regards her own talk newman was very sure himself that she herself enjoyed it this was as a sort of amendment to the portrait that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he discovered that she had naturally an abundance of gayety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been right at first in saying she was shy her shyness in a woman whose circumstances and tranquil beauty afforded every facility for wellmannered hardihood was only a charm the more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for newman it had lasted some time and even when it went it left something behind it which for a while performed the same office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was this the tearful secret of which mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tristram had had a glimpse and of which as of her friends reserve her highbreeding and her profundity she had given a sketch of which the outlines were perhaps rather too heavy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman supposed so but he found himself wondering less every day what madame de cintres secrets might be and more convinced that secrets were in themselves hateful things to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a woman for the light not for the shade and her natural line was not picturesque reserve and mysterious melancholy but frank joyous brilliant action with just so much meditation as was necessary and not a grain more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this apparently he had succeeded in bringing her back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt himself that he was an antidote to oppressive secrets what he offered her was in fact above all things a vast sunny immunity from the need of having any <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he often passed his evenings when madame de cintre had so appointed it at the chilly fireside of madame de bellegarde contenting himself with looking across the room through narrowed eyelids at his mistress who always made a point before her family of talking to some one else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde sat by the fire conversing neatly and coldly with whomsoever approached her and glancing round the room with her slowlyrestless eye the effect of which when it lighted upon him was to newmans sense identical with that of a sudden spurt of damp air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he shook hands with her he always asked her with a laugh whether she could stand him another evening and she replied without a laugh that thank god she had always been able to do her duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman talking once of the marquise to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tristram said that after all it was very easy to get on with her it always was easy to get on with outandout rascals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and is it by that elegant term said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tristram that you designate the marquise de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said newman she is wicked she is an old sinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt wonder if she had murdered some oneall from a sense of duty of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can you be so dreadful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am speaking of her favorably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray what will you say when you want to be severe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall keep my severity for some one elsefor the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a man i cant swallow mix the drink as i will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant quite make out it is something dreadfully bad something mean and underhand and not redeemed by audacity as his mothers misdemeanors may have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he has never committed murder he has at least turned his back and looked the other way while some one else was committing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of this invidious hypothesis which must be taken for nothing more than an example of the capricious play of american humor newman did his best to maintain an easy and friendly style of communication with m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so long as he was in personal contact with people he disliked extremely to have anything to forgive them and he was capable of a good deal of unsuspected imaginative effort for the sake of his own personal comfort to assume for the time that they were good fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did his best to treat the marquis as one he believed honestly moreover that he could not in reason be such a confounded fool as he seemed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newmans familiarity was never importunate his sense of human equality was not an aggressive taste or an aesthetic theory but something as natural and organic as a physical appetite which had never been put on a scanty allowance and consequently was innocent of ungraceful eagerness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tranquil unsuspectingness of the relativity of his own place in the social scale was probably irritating to m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde who saw himself reflected in the mind of his potential brotherinlaw in a crude and colorless form unpleasantly dissimilar to the impressive image projected upon his own intellectual mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never forgot himself for an instant and replied to what he must have considered newmans advances with mechanical politeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman who was constantly forgetting himself and indulging in an unlimited amount of irresponsible inquiry and conjecture now and then found himself confronted by the conscious ironical smile of his host <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde was smiling at he was at a loss to divine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegardes smile may be supposed to have been for himself a compromise between a great many emotions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so long as he smiled he was polite and it was proper he should be polite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a smile moreover committed him to nothing more than politeness and left the degree of politeness agreeably vague <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a smile too was neither dissentwhich was too serious nor agreement which might have brought on terrible complications <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then a smile covered his own personal dignity which in this critical situation he was resolved to keep immaculate it was quite enough that the glory of his house should pass into eclipse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between him and newman his whole manner seemed to declare there could be no interchange of opinion he was holding his breath so as not to inhale the odor of democracy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman was far from being versed in european politics but he liked to have a general idea of what was going on about him and he accordingly asked m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde several times what he thought of public affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde answered with suave concision that he thought as ill of them as possible that they were going from bad to worse and that the age was rotten to its core <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gave newman for the moment an almost kindly feeling for the marquis he pitied a man for whom the world was so cheerless a place and the next time he saw m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde he attempted to call his attention to some of the brilliant features of the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis presently replied that he had but a single political conviction which was enough for him he believed in the divine right of henry of bourbon fifth of his name to the throne of france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman stared and after this he ceased to talk politics with m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not horrified nor scandalized he was not even amused he felt as he should have felt if he had discovered in m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde a taste for certain oddities of diet an appetite for instance for fishbones or nutshells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under these circumstances of course he would never have broached dietary questions with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one afternoon on his calling on madame de cintre newman was requested by the servant to wait a few moments as his hostess was not at liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked about the room a while taking up her books smelling her flowers and looking at her prints and photographs which he thought prodigiously pretty and at last he heard the opening of a door to which his back was turned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the threshold stood an old woman whom he remembered to have met several times in entering and leaving the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was tall and straight and dressed in black and she wore a cap which if newman had been initiated into such mysteries would have been a sufficient assurance that she was not a frenchwoman a cap of pure british composition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a pale decent depressedlooking face and a clear dull english eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at newman a moment both intently and timidly and then she dropped a short straight english curtsey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre begs you will kindly wait she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has just come in she will soon have finished dressing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i will wait as long as she wants said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray tell her not to hurry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you sir said the woman softly and then instead of retiring with her message she advanced into the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked about her for a moment and presently went to a table and began to arrange certain books and knickknacks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman was struck with the high respectability of her appearance he was afraid to address her as a servant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she busied herself for some moments with putting the table in order and pulling the curtains straight while newman walked slowly to and fro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he perceived at last from her reflection in the mirror as he was passing that her hands were idle and that she was looking at him intently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she evidently wished to say something and newman perceiving it helped her to begin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes sir please she answered quickly and softly i was born in wiltshire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what do you think of paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i dont think of paris sir she said in the same tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is so long since i have been here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah you have been here very long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is more than forty years sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came over with lady emmeline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean with old madame de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came with her when she was married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was my ladys own woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you have been with her ever since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been in the house ever since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lady has taken a younger person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i am very old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you look very strong and well said newman observing the erectness of her figure and a certain venerable rosiness in her cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank god i am not ill sir i hope i know my duty too well to go panting and coughing about the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am an old woman sir and it is as an old woman that i venture to speak to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh speak out said newman curiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you neednt be afraid of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you have been coming to see the countess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have taken the liberty of noticing that you come often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes i come very often said newman laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you need not have been wideawake to notice that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have noticed it with pleasure sir said the ancient tirewoman gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she stood looking at newman with a strange expression of face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old instinct of deference and humility was there the habit of decent selfeffacement and knowledge of her own place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there mingled with it a certain mild audacity born of the occasion and of a sense probably of newmans unprecedented approachableness and beyond this a vague indifference to the old proprieties as if my ladys own woman had at last begun to reflect that since my lady had taken another person she had a slight reversionary property in herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you take a great interest in the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am glad of that said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in a moment he added smiling so do i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant help noticing these things and having our ideas can we sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid that when i let my thoughts meddle with such matters i am no longer a servant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am so devoted to the countess if she were my own child i couldnt love her more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is how i come to be so bold sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they say you want to marry her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman eyed his interlocutress and satisfied himself that she was not a gossip but a zealot she looked anxious appealing discreet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is quite true he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to marry madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to take her away to america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will take her wherever she wants to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the farther away the better sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the old woman with sudden intensity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she checked herself and taking up a paperweight in mosaic began to polish it with her black apron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mean anything against the house or the family sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i think a great change would do the poor countess good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes its not very lively said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but madame de cintre is gay herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is everything that is good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will not be vexed to hear that she has been gayer for a couple of months past than she had been in many a day before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman was delighted to gather this testimony to the prosperity of his suit but he repressed all violent marks of elation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has madame de cintre been in bad spirits before this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor lady she had good reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de cintre was no husband for a sweet young lady like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then as i say it has been a sad house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is better in my humble opinion that she were out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so if you will excuse me for saying so i hope she will marry you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must not lose courage sir if she doesnt make up her mind at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is what i wanted to beg of you sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will not take it ill if i say its a great risk for any lady at any time all the more when she has got rid of one bad bargain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if she can marry a good kind respectable gentleman i think she had better make up her mind to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they speak very well of you sir in the house and if you will allow me to say so i like your face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have a very different appearance from the late count he wasnt five feet high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say your fortune is beyond everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i beseech you to be patient sir and bide your time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i dont say this to you sir perhaps no one will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it is not for me to make any promises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i think your chance is not so bad sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am nothing but a weary old woman in my quiet corner but one woman understands another and i think i make out the countess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i received her in my arms when she came into the world and her first wedding day was the saddest of my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she owes it to me to show me another and a brighter one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will hold firm sirand you look as if you would i think we may see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am much obliged to you for your encouragement said newman heartily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if madame de cintre marries me you must come and live with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old woman looked at him strangely with her soft lifeless eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may seem a heartless thing to say sir when one has been forty years in a house but i may tell you that i should like to leave this place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why its just the time to say it said newman fervently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after forty years one wants a change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are very kind sir and this faithful servant dropped another curtsey and seemed disposed to retire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she lingered a moment and gave a timid joyless smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman was disappointed and his fingers stole half shyly half irritably into his waistcoatpocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank god i am not a frenchwoman she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were i would tell you with a brazen simper old as i am that if you please monsieur my information is worth something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me tell you so in my own decent english way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> simply this a promise not to hint to the countess that i have said these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if that is all you have it said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and having once more slid down telescopewise into her scanty petticoats the old woman departed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same moment madame de cintre came in by an opposite door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she noticed the movement of the other portiere and asked newman who had been entertaining him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an old lady in a black dress and a cap who curtsies up and down and expresses herself ever so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an old lady who curtsies and expresses herself? <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i happen to know that you have made a conquest of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cake she ought to be called said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is a delicious old woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre looked at him a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what can she have said to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is an excellent creature but we think her rather dismal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose newman answered presently that i like her because she has lived near you so long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since your birth she told me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said madame de cintre simply she is very faithful i can trust her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman had never made any reflections to this lady upon her mother and her brother urbain had given no hint of the impression they made upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as if she had guessed his thoughts she seemed careful to avoid all occasion for making him speak of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she never alluded to her mothers domestic decrees she never quoted the opinions of the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had talked however of valentin and she had made no secret of her extreme affection for her younger brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman listened sometimes with a certain harmless jealousy he would have liked to divert some of her tender allusions to his own credit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once madame de cintre told him with a little air of triumph about something that valentin had done which she thought very much to his honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a service he had rendered to an old friend of the family something more serious than valentin was usually supposed capable of being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman said he was glad to hear of it and then began to talk about something which lay upon his own heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre listened but after a while she said i dont like the way you speak of my brother valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hereupon newman surprised said that he had never spoken of him but kindly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is too kindly said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a kindness that costs nothing it is the kindness you show to a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is as if you didnt respect him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are not sure it is no respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if one loves a person that is a question one is not bound to answer said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should not have asked it of me then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very fond of your brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you would not like to resemble him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt like to resemble any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is hard enough work resembling ones self <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you mean asked madame de cintre by resembling ones self <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why doing what is expected of one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that is only when one is very good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well a great many people are good said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin is quite good enough for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre was silent for a short time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is not good enough for me she said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish he would do something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a proof of cleverness said newman to be happy without doing anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think valentin is happy in reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is clever generous brave but what is there to show for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to me there is something sad in his life and sometimes i have a sort of foreboding about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know why but l fancy he will have some great trouble perhaps an unhappy end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh leave him to me said newman jovially <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will watch over him and keep harm away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one evening in madame de bellegardes salon the conversation had flagged most sensibly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis walked up and down in silence like a sentinel at the door of some smoothfronted citadel of the proprieties his mother sat staring at the fire young madame de bellegarde worked at an enormous band of tapestry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> usually there were three or four visitors but on this occasion a violent storm sufficiently accounted for the absence of even the most devoted habitues <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the long silences the howling of the wind and the beating of the rain were distinctly audible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman sat perfectly still watching the clock determined to stay till the stroke of eleven but not a moment longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre had turned her back to the circle and had been standing for some time within the uplifted curtain of a window with her forehead against the pane gazing out into the deluged darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly she turned round toward her sisterinlaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for heavens sake she said with peculiar eagerness go to the piano and play something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde held up her tapestry and pointed to a little white flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont ask me to leave this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am in the midst of a masterpiece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my flower is going to smell very sweet i am putting in the smell with this goldcolored silk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am holding my breath i cant leave off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is absurd for me to play when you are present said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the next moment she went to the piano and began to strike the keys with vehemence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she played for some time rapidly and brilliantly when she stopped newman went to the piano and asked her to begin again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shook her head and on his insisting she said i have not been playing for you i have been playing for myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went back to the window again and looked out and shortly afterwards left the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when newman took leave urbain de bellegarde accompanied him as he always did just three steps down the staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the bottom stood a servant with his overcoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had just put it on when he saw madame de cintre coming towards him across the vestibule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall you be at home on friday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him a moment before answering his question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont like my mother and my brother she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hesitated a moment and then he said softly no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laid her hand on the balustrade and prepared to ascend the stairs fixing her eyes on the first step <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i shall be at home on friday and she passed up the wide dusky staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the friday as soon as he came in she asked him to please to tell her why he disliked her family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt say so did i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt mean it if i did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you would tell me what you think of them said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think of any of them but you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is because you dislike them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speak the truth you cant offend me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont exactly love your brother said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what is the use of my saying so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are too goodnatured said madame de cintre gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as if to avoid the appearance of inviting him to speak ill of the marquis she turned away motioning him to sit down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he remained standing before her and said presently what is of much more importance is that they dont like me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dont you think they are wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe i am a man to dislike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose that a man who may be liked may also be disliked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and my brothermy mother she added have not made you angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they think they have treated you very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no doubt they might have handled me much more roughly said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am much obliged to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are generous said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for me said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not when their sins are forgiven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont think i am as good as they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we shant quarrel about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant even agree with you without saying something that has a disagreeable sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman sat down and looked at her for some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think i really understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when you say it i believe it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a poor reason said madame de cintre smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no its a very good one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have a high spirit a high standard but with you its all natural and unaffected you dont seem to have stuck your head into a vise as if you were sitting for the photograph of propriety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think of me as a fellow who has had no idea in life but to make money and drive sharp bargains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a fair description of me but it is not the whole story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man ought to care for something else though i dont know exactly what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cared for moneymaking but i never cared particularly for the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing else to do and it was impossible to be idle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been very easy to others and to myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have done most of the things that people asked mei dont mean rascals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as regards your mother and your brother newman added there is only one point upon which i feel that i might quarrel with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont ask them to sing my praises to you but i ask them to let you alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i thought they talked ill of me to you i should come down upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have let me alone as you say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have not talked ill of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that case cried newman i declare they are only too good for this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre appeared to find something startling in his exclamation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would perhaps have replied but at this moment the door was thrown open and urbain de bellegarde stepped across the threshold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he appeared surprised at finding newman but his surprise was but a momentary shadow across the surface of an unwonted joviality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman had never seen the marquis so exhilarated his pale unlighted countenance had a sort of thin transfiguration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held open the door for some one else to enter and presently appeared old madame de bellegarde leaning on the arm of a gentleman whom newman had not seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had already risen and madame de cintre rose as she always did before her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis who had greeted newman almost genially stood apart slowly rubbing his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother came forward with her companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave a majestic little nod at newman and then she released the strange gentleman that he might make his bow to her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my daughter she said i have brought you an unknown relative lord deepmere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord deepmere is our cousin but he has done only today what he ought to have done long ago come to make our acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre smiled and offered lord deepmere her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very extraordinary said this noble laggard but this is the first time that i have ever been in paris for more than three or four weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how long have you been here now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh for the last two months said lord deepmere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these two remarks might have constituted an impertinence but a glance at lord deepmeres face would have satisfied you as it apparently satisfied madame de cintre that they constituted only a naivete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his companions were seated newman who was out of the conversation occupied himself with observing the newcomer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observation however as regards lord deepmeres person had no great range <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a small meagre man of some three and thirty years of age with a bald head a short nose and no front teeth in the upper jaw he had round candid blue eyes and several pimples on his chin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was evidently very shy and he laughed a great deal catching his breath with an odd startling sound as the most convenient imitation of repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his physiognomy denoted great simplicity a certain amount of brutality and probable failure in the past to profit by rare educational advantages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remarked that paris was awfully jolly but that for real thoroughpaced entertainment it was nothing to dublin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he even preferred dublin to london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had madame de cintre ever been to dublin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they must all come over there some day and he would show them some irish sport <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he always went to ireland for the fishing and he came to paris for the new offenbach things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they always brought them out in dublin but he couldnt wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been nine times to hear la pomme de paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre leaning back with her arms folded looked at lord deepmere with a more visibly puzzled face than she usually showed to society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde on the other hand wore a fixed smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis said that among light operas his favorite was the gazza ladra <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquise then began a series of inquiries about the duke and the cardinal the old countess and lady barbara after listening to which and to lord deepmeres somewhat irreverent responses for a quarter of an hour newman rose to take his leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis went with him three steps into the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked newman nodding in the direction of the visitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother was the daughter of lord finucane said the marquis he has great irish estates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lady bridget in the complete absence of male heirs either direct or collateral a most extraordinary circumstancecame in for everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lord deepmeres title is english and his english property is immense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a charming young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman answered nothing but he detained the marquis as the latter was beginning gracefully to recede <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a good time for me to thank you he said for sticking so punctiliously to our bargain for doing so much to help me on with your sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really i have done nothing that i can boast of he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh dont be modest newman answered laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant flatter myself that i am doing so well simply by my own merit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thank your mother for me too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he turned away leaving m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next time newman came to the rue de luniversite he had the good fortune to find madame de cintre alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had come with a definite intention and he lost no time in executing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore moreover a look which he eagerly interpreted as expectancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been coming to see you for six months now he said and i have never spoken to you a second time of marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was what you asked me i obeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could any man have done better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have acted with great delicacy said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well im going to change now said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mean that i am going to be indelicate but im going to go back to where i began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been all round the circle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or rather i have never been away from here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never ceased to want what i wanted then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only now i am more sure of it if possible i am more sure of myself and more sure of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you better though i dont know anything i didnt believe three months ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are everythingyou are beyond everything i can imagine or desire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know me now you must know me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont say that you have seen the bestbut you have seen the worst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you have been thinking all this while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have seen that i was only waiting you cant suppose that i was changing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what will you say to me now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say that everything is clear and reasonable and that i have been very patient and considerate and deserve my reward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then give me your hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew you were only waiting she said and i was very sure this day would come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have thought about it a great deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first i was half afraid of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am not afraid of it now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused a moment and then she added its a relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was sitting on a low chair and newman was on an ottoman near her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaned a little and took her hand which for an instant she let him keep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that means that i have not waited for nothing he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him for a moment and he saw her eyes fill with tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with me he went on you will be as safeas safeand even in his ardor he hesitated a moment for a comparisonas safe he said with a kind of simple solemnity as in your fathers arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still she looked at him and her tears increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then abruptly she buried her face on the cushioned arm of the sofa beside her chair and broke into noiseless sobs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am weaki am weak he heard her say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the more reason why you should give yourself up to me he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is that so hard to believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to you everything seems so simple she said raising her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i liked you six months ago and now i am sure of it as you say you are sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is not easy simply for that to decide to marry you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are a great many things to think about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there ought to be only one thing to think aboutthat we love each other said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as she remained silent he quickly added very good if you cant accept that dont tell me so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should be very glad to think of nothing she said at last not to think at all only to shut both my eyes and give myself up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im cold im old im a coward i never supposed i should marry again and it seems to me very strange l should ever have listened to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i used to think as a girl of what i should do if i were to marry freely by my own choice i thought of a very different man from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats nothing against me said newman with an immense smile your taste was not formed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his smile made madame de cintre smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then she said in a different tone where do you wish to live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anywhere in the wide world you like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know why i ask you she presently continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think if i were to marry you i could live almost anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have some false ideas about me you think that i need a great many thingsthat i must have a brilliant worldly life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure you are prepared to take a great deal of trouble to give me such things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that is very arbitrary i have done nothing to prove that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused again looking at him and her mingled sound and silence were so sweet to him that he had no wish to hurry her any more than he would have had a wish to hurry a golden sunrise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your being so different which at first seemed a difficulty a trouble began one day to seem to me a pleasure a great pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was glad you were different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet if i had said so no one would have understood me i dont mean simply to my family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would have said i was a queer monster eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would have said i could never be happy with you you were too different and i would have said it was just because you were so different that i might be happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they would have given better reasons than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my only reason and she paused again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this time in the midst of his golden sunrise newman felt the impulse to grasp at a rosy cloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your only reason is that you love me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he murmured with an eloquent gesture and for want of a better reason madame de cintre reconciled herself to this one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman came back the next day and in the vestibule as he entered the house he encountered his friend mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was wandering about in honorable idleness and when his eyes fell upon her she delivered him one of her curtsies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then turning to the servant who had admitted him she said with the combined majesty of her native superiority and of a rugged english accent you may retire i will have the honor of conducting monsieur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of this combination however it appeared to newman that her voice had a slight quaver as if the tone of command were not habitual to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man gave her an impertinent stare but he walked slowly away and she led newman upstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at half its course the staircase gave a bend forming a little platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the angle of the wall stood an indifferent statue of an eighteenthcentury nymph simpering sallow and cracked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bread stopped and looked with shy kindness at her companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know the good news sir she murmured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have a good right to be first to know it said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have taken such a friendly interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bread turned away and began to blow the dust off the statue as if this might be mockery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you want to congratulate me said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he added you gave me much pleasure the other day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not to think that i have been told anything she said i have only guessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when i looked at you as you came in i was sure i had guessed aright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are very sharp said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure that in your quiet way you see everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not a fool sir thank god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have guessed something else beside said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i neednt tell you that sir i dont think you would believe it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate it wouldnt please you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh tell me nothing but what will please me laughed newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the way you began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir i suppose you wont be vexed to hear that the sooner everything is over the better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sooner we are married you mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know you are coming to live with us said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im extremely obliged to you sir but it is not of myself i was thinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only wanted if i might take the liberty to recommend you to lose no time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bread looked up the staircase and then down and then she looked at the undusted nymph as if she possibly had sentient ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid of every one she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what an uncomfortable state of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does every one wish to prevent my marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid of already having said too much mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont take it back but i wont say any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she took her way up the staircase again and led him into madame de cintres salon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman indulged in a brief and silent imprecation when he found that madame de cintre was not alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with her sat her mother and in the middle of the room stood young madame de bellegarde in her bonnet and mantle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old marquise who was leaning back in her chair with a hand clasping the knob of each arm looked at him fixedly without moving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed barely conscious of his greeting she appeared to be musing intently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman said to himself that her daughter had been announcing her engagement and that the old lady found the morsel hard to swallow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but madame de cintre as she gave him her hand gave him also a look by which she appeared to mean that he should understand something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it a warning or a request <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did she wish to enjoin speech or silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was puzzled and young madame de bellegardes pretty grin gave him no information <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not told my mother said madame de cintre abruptly looking at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you tell me too little you should tell me everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is what i do said madame urbain with a little laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me tell your mother said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady stared at him again and then turned to her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are going to marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oui ma mere said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your daughter has consented to my great happiness said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when was this arrangement made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seem to be picking up the news by chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my suspense came to an end yesterday said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how long was mine to have lasted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the marquise to her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spoke without irritation with a sort of cold noble displeasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre stood silent with her eyes on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is over now she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where is my sonwhere is urbain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> send for your brother and inform him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young madame de bellegarde laid her hand on the bellrope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was to make some visits with me and i was to go and knockvery softly very softlyat the door of his study <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he can come to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she pulled the bell and in a few moments mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bread appeared with a face of calm inquiry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> send for your brother said the old lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but newman felt an irresistible impulse to speak and to speak in a certain way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell the marquis we want him he said to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young madame de bellegarde went to her sisterinlaw and embraced her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she turned to newman with an intense smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i congratulate you sir said madame de bellegarde with extreme solemnity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my daughter is an extraordinarily good woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she may have faults but i dont know them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother does not often make jokes said madame de cintre but when she does they are terrible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is ravishing the marquise urbain resumed looking at her sisterinlaw with her head on one side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre turned away and taking up a piece of tapestry began to ply the needle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some minutes of silence elapsed which were interrupted by the arrival of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came in with his hat in his hand gloved and was followed by his brother valentin who appeared to have just entered the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde looked around the circle and greeted newman with his usual finelymeasured courtesy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin saluted his mother and his sisters and as he shook hands with newman gave him a glance of acute interrogation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have great news for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speak to your brother my daughter said the old lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre had been looking at her tapestry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she raised her eyes to her brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your sister has consented said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see after all i knew what i was about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so am i said valentin to newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis and i are charmed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant marry myself but i can understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant stand on my head but i can applaud a clever acrobat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear sister i bless your union <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis stood looking for a while into the crown of his hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have been prepared he said at last but it is inevitable that in face of the event one should experience a certain emotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he gave a most unhilarious smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel no emotion that i was not perfectly prepared for said his mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant say that for myself said newman smiling but differently from the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am happier than i expected to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose its the sight of your happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont exaggerate that said madame de bellegarde getting up and laying her hand upon her daughters arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant expect an honest old woman to thank you for taking away her beautiful only daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you forgot me dear madame said the young marquise demurely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she is very beautiful said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when is the wedding pray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked young madame de bellegarde i must have a month to think over a dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that must be discussed said the marquise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh we will discuss it and let you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no doubt we shall agree said urbain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont agree with madame de cintre you will be very unreasonable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come come urbain said young madame de bellegarde i must go straight to my tailors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady had been standing with her hand on her daughters arm looking at her fixedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave a little sigh and murmured no i did not expect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are a fortunate man she added turning to newman with an expressive nod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel like crying it on the housetopslike stopping people in the street to tell them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde narrowed her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more people that know it the better newman declared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent yet announced it here but i telegraphed it this morning to america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis and to san francisco those are the principal cities you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow i shall tell my friends here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked madame de bellegarde in a tone of which i am afraid that newman but partly measured the impertinence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> enough to bring me a great many handshakes and congratulations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to say nothing he added in a moment of those i shall receive from your friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will not use the telegraph said the marquise taking her departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde whose wife her imagination having apparently taken flight to the tailors was fluttering her silken wings in emulation shook hands with newman and said with a more persuasive accent than the latter had ever heard him use you may count upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then his wife led him away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin stood looking from his sister to our hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you both reflected seriously he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have neither your powers of reflection nor your depth of seriousness but we have done our best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i have a great regard for each of you valentin continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am not satisfied on the whole that you belong to that small and superior classthat exquisite group composed of persons who are worthy to remain unmarried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are rare souls they are the salt of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont mean to be invidious the marrying people are often very nice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin holds that women should marry and that men should not said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how he arranges it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i arrange it by adoring you my sister said valentin ardently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> adore some one whom you can marry said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will arrange that for you some day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i foresee that i am going to turn apostle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin was on the threshold he looked back a moment with a face that had turned grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i adore some one i cant marry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he dropped the portiere and departed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont like it said newman standing alone before madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she said after a moment they dont like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well now do you mind that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should prefer that my mother were pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the deuce demanded newman is she not pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave you leave to marry me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very true i dont understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet i do mind it as you say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will depend upon how much you let it bother you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i shall call it an awful bore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will keep it to myself said madame de cintre it shall not bother you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they talked of their marriageday and madame de cintre assented unreservedly to newmans desire to have it fixed for an early date <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newmans telegrams were answered with interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having dispatched but three electric missives he received no less than eight gratulatory bulletins in return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put them into his pocketbook and the next time he encountered old madame de bellegarde drew them forth and displayed them to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this it must be confessed was a slightly malicious stroke the reader must judge in what degree the offense was venial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman knew that the marquise disliked his telegrams though he could see no sufficient reason for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre on the other hand liked them and most of them being of a humorous cast laughed at them immoderately and inquired into the character of their authors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman now that his prize was gained felt a peculiar desire that his triumph should be manifest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he more than suspected that the bellegardes were keeping quiet about it and allowing it in their select circle but a limited resonance and it pleased him to think that if he were to take the trouble he might as he phrased it break all the windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no man likes being repudiated and yet newman if he was not flattered was not exactly offended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not this good excuse for his somewhat aggressive impulse to promulgate his felicity his sentiment was of another quality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted for once to make the heads of the house of bellegarde feel him he knew not when he should have another chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had had for the past six months a sense of the old lady and her son looking straight over his head and he was now resolved that they should toe a mark which he would give himself the satisfaction of drawing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is like seeing a bottle emptied when the wine is poured too slowly he said to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they make me want to joggle their elbows and force them to spill their wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tristram answered that he had better leave them alone and let them do things in their own way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must make allowances for them she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is natural enough that they should hang fire a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they thought they accepted you when you made your application but they are not people of imagination they could not project themselves into the future and now they will have to begin again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they are people of honor and they will do whatever is necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman spent a few moments in narroweyed meditation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not hard on them he presently said and to prove it i will invite them all to a festival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have been laughing at my great gilded rooms all winter i will show you that they are good for something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the grandest thing one can do here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will hire all the great singers from the opera and all the first people from the theatre francais and i will give an entertainment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the old lady and her son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then every one among her friends whom i have met at her house or elsewhere every one who has shown me the minimum of politeness every duke of them and his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then all my friends without exception miss kitty upjohn miss dora finch general packard c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> p hatch and all the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and every one shall know what it is about that is to celebrate my engagement to the countess de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think of the idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then in a moment i think it is delicious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very next evening newman repaired to madame de bellegardes salon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where he found her surrounded by her children and invited her to honor his poor dwelling by her presence on a certain evening a fortnight distant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear sir she cried what do you want to do to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make you acquainted with a few people and then to place you in a very easy chair and ask you to listen to madame frezzolinis singing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean to give a concert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to have a crowd of people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all my friends and i hope some of yours and your daughters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to celebrate my engagement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to newman that madame de bellegarde turned pale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she opened her fan a fine old painted fan of the last century and looked at the picture which represented a fete champetre a lady with a guitar singing and a group of dancers round a garlanded hermes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we go out so little murmured the marquis since my poor fathers death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my dear father is still alive my friend said his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am only waiting for my invitation to accept it and she glanced with amiable confidence at newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be magnificent i am very sure of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry to say to the discredit of newmans gallantry that this ladys invitation was not then and there bestowed he was giving all his attention to the old marquise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked up at last smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant think of letting you offer me a fete she said until i have offered you one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we want to present you to our friends we will invite them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have it very much at heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must do things in order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come to me about the th i will let you know the exact day immediately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall not have any one so fine as madame frezzolini but we shall have some very good people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that you may talk of your own fete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady spoke with a certain quick eagerness smiling more agreeably as she went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to newman a handsome proposal and such proposals always touched the sources of his goodnature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said to madame de bellegarde that he should be glad to come on the th or any other day and that it mattered very little whether he met his friends at her house or at his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have said that newman was observant but it must be admitted that on this occasion he failed to notice a certain delicate glance which passed between madame de bellegarde and the marquis and which we may presume to have been a commentary upon the innocence displayed in that latter clause of his speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin de bellegarde walked away with newman that evening and when they had left the rue de luniversite some distance behind them he said reflectively my mother is very strongvery strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then in answer to an interrogative movement of newmans he continued she was driven to the wall but you would never have thought it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her fete of the th was an invention of the moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had no idea whatever of giving a fete but finding it the only issue from your proposal she looked straight at the dose excuse the expressionand bolted it as you saw without winking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said newman divided between relish and compassion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care a straw for her fete i am willing to take the will for the deed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no said valentin with a little inconsequent touch of family pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing will be done now and done handsomely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin de bellegardes announcement of the secession of mademoiselle nioche from her fathers domicile and his irreverent reflections upon the attitude of this anxious parent in so grave a catastrophe received a practical commentary in the fact that m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche was slow to seek another interview with his late pupil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had cost newman some disgust to be forced to assent to valentins somewhat cynical interpretation of the old mans philosophy and though circumstances seemed to indicate that he had not given himself up to a noble despair newman thought it very possible he might be suffering more keenly than was apparent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche had been in the habit of paying him a respectful little visit every two or three weeks and his absence might be a proof quite as much of extreme depression as of a desire to conceal the success with which he had patched up his sorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman presently learned from valentin several details touching this new phase of mademoiselle noemies career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you she was remarkable this unshrinking observer declared and the way she has managed this performance proves it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has had other chances but she was resolved to take none but the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did you the honor to think for a while that you might be such a chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were not so she gathered up her patience and waited a while longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last her occasion came along and she made her move with her eyes wide open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very sure she had no innocence to lose but she had all her respectability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dubious little damsel as you thought her she had kept a firm hold of that nothing could be proved against her and she was determined not to let her reputation go till she had got her equivalent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about her equivalent she had high ideas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apparently her ideal has been satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is fifty years old baldheaded and deaf but it is very easy about money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and where in the world asked newman did you pick up this valuable information <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in conversation with a young woman engaged in the humble trade of glovecleaner who keeps a small shop in the rue st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche lives in the same house up six pair of stairs across the court in and out of whose illswept doorway miss noemie has been flitting for the last five years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little glovecleaner was an old acquaintance she used to be the friend of a friend of mine who has married and dropped such friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i often saw her in his society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i espied her behind her clear little windowpane i recollected her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had on a spotlessly fresh pair of gloves but i went in and held up my hands and said to her dear mademoiselle what will you ask me for cleaning these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear count she answered immediately i will clean them for you for nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had instantly recognized me and i had to hear her history for the last six years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after that i put her upon that of her neighbors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knows and admires noemie and she told me what i have just repeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche reappearing and newman who every morning read two or three suicides in the figaro began to suspect that mortification proving stubborn he had sought a balm for his wounded pride in the waters of the seine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a note of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioches address in his pocketbook and finding himself one day in the quartier he determined in so far as he might to clear up his doubts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he repaired to the house in the rue st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roch which bore the recorded number and observed in a neighboring basement behind a dangling row of neatly inflated gloves the attentive physiognomy of bellegardes informanta sallow person in a dressinggown peering into the street as if she were expecting that amiable nobleman to pass again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was not to her that newman applied he simply asked of the portress if m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the portress replied as the portress invariably replies that her lodger had gone out barely three minutes before but then through the little square hole of her lodgewindow taking the measure of newmans fortunes and seeing them by an unspecified process refresh the dry places of servitude to occupants of fifth floors on courts she added that m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche would have had just time to reach the cafe de la patrie round the second corner to the left at which establishment he regularly spent his afternoons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman thanked her for the information took the second turning to the left and arrived at the cafe de la patrie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt a momentary hesitation to go in was it not rather mean to follow up poor old nioche at that rate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there passed across his vision an image of a haggard little septuagenarian taking measured sips of a glass of sugar and water and finding them quite impotent to sweeten his desolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he opened the door and entered perceiving nothing at first but a dense cloud of tobacco smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across this however in a corner he presently descried the figure of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche stirring the contents of a deep glass with a lady seated in front of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ladys back was turned to newman but m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche very soon perceived and recognized his visitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman had gone toward him and the old man rose slowly gazing at him with a more blighted expression even than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are drinking hot punch said newman i suppose you are not dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche stood staring with a fallen jaw not daring to put out his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady who sat facing him turned round in her place and glanced upward with a spirited toss of her head displaying the agreeable features of his daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at newman sharply to see how he was looking at her theni dont know what she discoveredshe said graciously how d ye do monsieur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wont you come into our little corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you comedid you come after me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went to your house to see what had become of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you might be sick said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very good of you as always said the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ask monsieur to sit down said mademoiselle nioche <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you do us the honor to seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche timorously and with a double foreignness of accent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman said to himself that he had better see the thing out and he took a chair at the end of the table with mademoiselle nioche on his left and her father on the other side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will take something of course said miss noemie who was sipping a glass of madeira <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman said that he believed not and then she turned to her papa with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has come only for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche drained his pungent glass at a long draught and looked out from eyes more lachrymose in consequence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you didnt come for me eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt expect to find me here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman observed the change in her appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was very elegant and prettier than before she looked a year or two older and it was noticeable that to the eye she had only gained in respectability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was dressed in quiet colors and wore her expensively unobtrusive toilet with a grace that might have come from years of practice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her present selfpossession and aplomb struck newman as really infernal and he inclined to agree with valentin de bellegarde that the young lady was very remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no to tell the truth i didnt come for you he said and i didnt expect to find you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was told he added in a moment that you had left your father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried mademoiselle nioche with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have the proof of the contrary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes convincing proof said newman glancing at m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man caught his glance obliquely with his faded deprecating eye and then lifting his empty glass pretended to drink again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i set you a better example <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knows a great deal about meor he thinks he does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has taken a great deal of trouble to find out but half of it isnt true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place i havent left my father i am much too fond of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde is a charming young man it is impossible to be cleverer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know a good deal about him too you can tell him that when you next see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said newman with a sturdy grin i wont carry any messages for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as you please said mademoiselle nioche i dont depend upon you nor does m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is very much interested in me he can be left to his own devices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a contrast to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh he is a great contrast to me i have no doubt said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont exactly know how you mean it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean it in this way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first of all he never offered to help me to a dot and a husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont say that is in his favor for i do you justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what led you by the way to make me such a queer offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes i did said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have given me real pleasure to see you married to a respectable young fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with six thousand francs of income <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you call that caring for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid you know little about women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were not galant you were not what you might have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no idea i had been so shabby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle nioche smiled as she took up her muff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is something at any rate to have made you angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her father had leaned both his elbows on the table and his head bent forward was supported in his hands the thin white fingers of which were pressed over his ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his position he was staring fixedly at the bottom of his empty glass and newman supposed he was not hearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle noemie buttoned her furred jacket and pushed back her chair casting a glance charged with the consciousness of an expensive appearance first down over her flounces and then up at newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had better have remained an honest girl newman said quietly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche continued to stare at the bottom of his glass and his daughter got up still bravely smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean that i look so much like one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats more than most women do nowadays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont judge me yet a while she added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean to succeed thats what i mean to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i leave you i dont mean to be seen in cafes for one thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant think what you want of my poor father hes very comfortable now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she tapped the old man on the head with her muff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she stopped a minute looking at newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde when he wants news of me to come and get it from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she turned and departed the whiteaproned waiter with a bow holding the door wide open for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche sat motionless and newman hardly knew what to say to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man looked dismally foolish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you determined not to shoot her after all newman said presently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche without moving raised his eyes and gave him a long peculiar look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to confess everything and yet not to ask for pity nor to pretend on the other hand to a rugged ability to do without it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might have expressed the state of mind of an innocuous insect flat in shape and conscious of the impending pressure of a bootsole and reflecting that he was perhaps too flat to be crushed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioches gaze was a profession of moral flatness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you despise me terribly he said in the weakest possible voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no said newman it is none of my business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a good plan to take things easily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made you too many fine speeches m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meant them at the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure i am very glad you didnt shoot her said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was afraid you might have shot yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is why i came to look you up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he began to button his coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you despise me and i cant explain to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hoped i shouldnt see you again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why thats rather shabby said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you shouldnt drop your friends that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides the last time you came to see me i thought you particularly jolly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche musingly i was in a fever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know what i said what i did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah well you are quieter now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as quiet as the grave he whispered softly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche rubbed his forehead slowly and even pushed back his wig a little looking askance at his empty glass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my daughter does what she will with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i take what she gives me good or bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no spirit and when you have no spirit you must keep quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shant trouble you any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said newman rather disgusted at the smooth operation of the old mans philosophy thats as you please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche seemed to have been prepared to be despised but nevertheless he made a feeble movement of appeal from newmans faint praise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all he said she is my daughter and i can still look after her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she will do wrong why she will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there are many different paths there are degrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can give her the benefitgive her the benefit and m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche paused staring vaguely at newman who began to suspect that his brain had softenedthe benefit of my experience m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired newman both amused and amazed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my experience of business said m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah yes said newman laughing that will be a great advantage to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he said goodby and offered the poor foolish old man his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche took it and leaned back against the wall holding it a moment and looking up at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you think my wits are going he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very likely i have always a pain in my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why i cant explain i cant tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and shes so strong she makes me walk as she will anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he stopped still staring up at newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his little white eyes expanded and glittered for a moment like those of a cat in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its horrible its horrible said m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche but do you want to know the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i take what she gives me and i hate her more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> today she brought me three hundred francs they are here in my waistcoat pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i hate her almost cruelly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did you accept the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche i should have hated her still more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take care you dont hurt her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with this he took his leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he passed along the glazed side of the cafe on reaching the street he saw the old man motioning the waiter with a melancholy gesture to replenish his glass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day a week after his visit to the cafe de la patrie he called upon valentin de bellegarde and by good fortune found him at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman spoke of his interview with m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioche and his daughter and said he was afraid valentin had judged the old man correctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had found the couple hobnobbing together in all amity the old gentlemans rigor was purely theoretic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman confessed that he was disappointed he should have expected to see m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> high ground my dear fellow said valentin laughing there is no high ground for him to take <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only perceptible eminence in m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nioches horizon is montmartre which is not an edifying quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant go mountaineering in a flat country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remarked indeed said newman that he has not forgiven her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but shell never find it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must do him the justice to suppose he doesnt like the thing valentin rejoined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle nioche is like the great artists whose biographies we read who at the beginning of their career have suffered opposition in the domestic circle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their vocation has not been recognized by their families but the world has done it justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh come said newman impatiently you take the little baggage too seriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know i do but when one has nothing to think about one must think of little baggages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose it is better to be serious about light things than not to be serious at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knows you have been hunting her up and asking questions about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is very much tickled by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annoying my dear fellow laughed valentin not the least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hanged if i should want to have a greedy little adventuress like that know i was giving myself such pains about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pretty woman is always worth ones pains objected valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mademoiselle nioche is welcome to be tickled by my curiosity and to know that i am tickled that she is tickled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is not so much tickled by the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had better go and tell her newman rejoined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave me a message for you of some such drift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless your quiet imagination said valentin i have been to see her three times in five days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is a charming hostess we talk of shakespeare and the musical glasses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is extremely clever and a very curious type not at all coarse or wanting to be coarse determined not to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she means to take very good care of herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is extremely perfect she is as hard and clearcut as some little figure of a seanymph in an antique intaglio and i will warrant that she has not a grain more of sentiment or heart than if she was scooped out of a big amethyst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant scratch her even with a diamond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> extremely prettyreally when you know her she is wonderfully pretty intelligent determined ambitious unscrupulous capable of looking at a man strangled without changing color she is upon my honor extremely entertaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a fine list of attractions said newman they would serve as a policedetectives description of a favorite criminal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should sum them up by another word than entertaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why that is just the word to use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont say she is laudable or lovable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want her as my wife or my sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she is a very curious and ingenious piece of machinery i like to see it in operation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i have seen some very curious machines too said newman and once in a needle factory i saw a gentleman from the city who had stopped too near one of them picked up as neatly as if he had been prodded by a fork swallowed down straight and ground into small pieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reentering his domicile late in the evening three days after madame de bellegarde had made her bargain with him the expression is sufficiently correcttouching the entertainment at which she was to present him to the world he found on his table a card of goodly dimensions bearing an announcement that this lady would be at home on the th of the month at ten oclock in the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stuck it into the frame of his mirror and eyed it with some complacency it seemed an agreeable emblem of triumph documentary evidence that his prize was gained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stretched out in a chair he was looking at it lovingly when valentin de bellegarde was shown into the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentins glance presently followed the direction of newmans and he perceived his mothers invitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what have they put into the corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not the customary music dancing or tableaux vivants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ought at least to put an american <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh there are to be several of us said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tristram told me today that she had received a card and sent an acceptance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tristram and her husband you will have support <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother might have put on her card three americans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i suspect you will not lack amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will see a great many of the best people in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean the long pedigrees and the high noses and all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of them are awful idiots i advise you to take them up cautiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i guess i shall like them said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am prepared to like every one and everything in these days i am in high goodhumor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin looked at him a moment in silence and then dropped himself into a chair with an unwonted air of weariness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take care you dont become offensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any one chooses to take offense he may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a good conscience said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you are really in love with my sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess she likes me said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the witchcraft you have used <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i havent any general rules said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in any way that seems acceptable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suspect that if one knew it said valentin laughing you are a terrible customer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is something the matter with you tonight newman said in response to this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> spare me all discordant sounds until after my marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when i have settled down for life i shall be better able to take things as they come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when does your marriage take place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin was silent a while and then he said and you feel very confident about the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew what i wanted exactly and i know what i have got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are sure you are going to be happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so foolish a question deserves a foolish answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not afraid of anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what should i be afraid of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant hurt me unless you kill me by some violent means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i should indeed consider a tremendous sell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to live and i mean to live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant die of illness i am too ridiculously tough and the time for dying of old age wont come round yet a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant lose my wife i shall take too good care of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may lose my money or a large part of it but that wont matter for i shall make twice as much again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so what have i to be afraid of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not afraid it may be rather a mistake for an american man of business to marry a french countess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the countess possibly but not for the man of business if you mean me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my countess shall not be disappointed i answer for her happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as if he felt the impulse to celebrate his happy certitude by a bonfire he got up to throw a couple of logs upon the already blazing hearth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin watched for a few moments the quickened flame and then with his head leaning on his hand gave a melancholy sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> je suis triste said valentin with gallic simplicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is about the lady you said the other night that you adored and that you couldnt marry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me afterwards that the words had escaped me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before claire it was bad taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i felt gloomy as i spoke and i feel gloomy still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did you ever introduce me to that girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont mean to say you are lovesick about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lovesick no its not a grand passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the coldblooded little demon sticks in my thoughts she has bitten me with those even little teeth of hers i feel as if i might turn rabid and do something crazy in consequence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its very low its disgustingly low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes the most mercenary little jade in europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet she really affects my peace of mind she is always running in my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a striking contrast to your noble and virtuous attachment a vile contrast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is rather pitiful that it should be the best i am able to do for myself at my present respectable age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a nice young man eh en somme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant warrant my future as you do your own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drop that girl short said newman dont go near her again and your future will do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come over to america and i will get you a place in a bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is easy to say drop her said valentin with a light laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant drop a pretty woman like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one must be polite even with noemie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides ill not have her suppose i am afraid of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so between politeness and vanity you will get deeper into the mud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep them both for something better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember too that i didnt want to introduce you to her you insisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a sort of uneasy feeling about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i dont reproach you said valentin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt for the world have missed knowing her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the way she has already spread her wings is amazing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know when a woman has amused me more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but excuse me he added in an instant she doesnt amuse you at second hand and the subject is an impure one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us talk of something else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> valentin introduced another topic but within five minutes newman observed that by a bold transition he had reverted to mademoiselle nioche and was giving pictures of her manners and quoting specimens of her mots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were very witty and for a young woman who six months before had been painting the most artless madonnas startlingly cynical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at last abruptly he stopped became thoughtful and for some time afterwards said nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he rose to go it was evident that his thoughts were still running upon mademoiselle nioche <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes shes a frightful little monster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next ten days were the happiest that newman had ever known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw madame de cintre every day and never saw either old madame de bellegarde or the elder of his prospective brothersinlaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre at last seemed to think it becoming to apologize for their never being present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are much taken up she said with doing the honors of paris to lord deepmere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a smile in her gravity as she made this declaration and it deepened as she added he is our seventh cousin you know and blood is thicker than water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he is so interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman met young madame de bellegarde two or three times always roaming about with graceful vagueness as if in search of an unattainable ideal of amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she always reminded him of a painted perfumebottle with a crack in it but he had grown to have a kindly feeling for her based on the fact of her owing conjugal allegiance to urbain de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegardes wife especially since she was a silly thirstilysmiling little brunette with a suggestion of an unregulated heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the small marquise sometimes looked at him with an intensity too marked not to be innocent for coquetry is more finely shaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she apparently wanted to ask him something or tell him something he wondered what it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was shy of giving her an opportunity because if her communication bore upon the aridity of her matrimonial lot he was at a loss to see how he could help her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a fancy however of her coming up to him some day and saying after looking around behind her with a little passionate hiss i know you detest my husband let me have the pleasure of assuring you for once that you are right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pity a poor woman who is married to a clockimage in papiermache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> possessing however in default of a competent knowledge of the principles of etiquette a very downright sense of the meanness of certain actions it seemed to him to belong to his position to keep on his guard he was not going to put it into the power of these people to say that in their house he had done anything unpleasant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was madame de bellegarde used to give him news of the dress she meant to wear at his wedding and which had not yet in her creative imagination in spite of many interviews with the tailor resolved itself into its composite totality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you pale blue bows on the sleeves at the elbows she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but today i dont see my blue bows at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what has become of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> today i see pink a tender pink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i pass through strange dull phases in which neither blue nor pink says anything to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet i must have the bows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have them green or yellow said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> green bows would break your marriageyour children would be illegitimate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre was calmly happy before the world and newman had the felicity of fancying that before him when the world was absent she was almost agitatedly happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i take no pleasure in you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you never give me a chance to scold you to correct you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bargained for that i expected to enjoy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you wont do anything dreadful you are dismally inoffensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very stupid there is no excitement for me i might as well be marrying some one else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid its the worst i can do newman would say in answer to this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he assured her that he at least would never scold her she was perfectly satisfactory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you only knew he said how exactly you are what i coveted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i am beginning to understand why i coveted it the having it makes all the difference that i expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never was a man so pleased with his good fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have been holding your head for a week past just as i wanted my wife to hold hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you say just the things i want her to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you walk about the room just as i want her to walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have just the taste in dress that i want her to have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short you come up to the mark and i can tell you my mark was high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these observations seemed to make madame de cintre rather grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last she said depend upon it i dont come up to the mark your mark is too high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not all that you suppose i am a much smaller affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is a magnificent woman your ideal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray how did she come to such perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was never anything else newman said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i really believe madame de cintre went on that she is better than my own ideal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know that is a very handsome compliment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir i will make her my own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tristram came to see her dear claire after newman had announced his engagement and she told our hero the next day that his good fortune was simply absurd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the ridiculous part of it is she said that you are evidently going to be as happy as if you were marrying miss smith or miss thompson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i call it a brilliant match for you but you get brilliancy without paying any tax upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those things are usually a compromise but here you have everything and nothing crowds anything else out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will be brilliantly happy as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman thanked her for her pleasant encouraging way of saying things no woman could encourage or discourage better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tristrams way of saying things was different he had been taken by his wife to call upon madame de cintre and he gave an account of the expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont catch me giving an opinion on your countess this time he said i put my foot in it once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a dd underhand thing to do by the waycoming round to sound a fellow upon the woman you are going to marry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then of course you rush and tell her and she takes care to make it pleasant for the poor spiteful wretch the first time he calls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will do you the justice to say however that you dont seem to have told madame de cintre or if you have shes uncommonly magnanimous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was very nice she was tremendously polite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and lizzie sat on the sofa pressing each others hands and calling each other chere belle and madame de cintre sent me with every third word a magnificent smile as if to give me to understand that i too was a handsome dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she quite made up for past neglect i assure you she was very pleasant and sociable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only in an evil hour it came into her head to say that she must present us to her motherher mother wished to know your friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt want to know her mother and i was on the point of telling lizzie to go in alone and let me wait for her outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lizzie with her usual infernal ingenuity guessed my purpose and reduced me by a glance of her eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they marched off arm in arm and i followed as i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found the old lady in her armchair twiddling her aristocratic thumbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at lizzie from head to foot but at that game lizzie to do her justice was a match for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wife told her we were great friends of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquise started a moment and then said oh mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my daughter has made up her mind to marry a mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then madame de cintre began to fondle lizzie again and said it was this dear lady that had planned the match and brought them together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh tis you i have to thank for my american soninlaw the old lady said to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a very clever thought of yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then she began to look at me and presently said pray are you engaged in some species of manufacture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to say that i manufactured broomsticks for old witches to ride on but lizzie got in ahead of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my husband madame la marquise she said belongs to that unfortunate class of persons who have no profession and no business and do very little good in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to get her poke at the old woman she didnt care where she shoved me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear me said the marquise we all have our duties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry mine compel me to take leave of you said lizzie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you have a motherinlaw in all the force of the term <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh said newman my motherinlaw desires nothing better than to let me alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> betimes on the evening of the th he went to madame de bellegardes ball <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old house in the rue de luniversite looked strangely brilliant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the circle of light projected from the outer gate a detachment of the populace stood watching the carriages roll in the court was illumined with flaring torches and the portico carpeted with crimson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when newman arrived there were but a few people present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquise and her two daughters were at the top of the staircase where the sallow old nymph in the angle peeped out from a bower of plants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde in purple and fine laces looked like an old lady painted by vandyke madame de cintre was dressed in white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady greeted newman with majestic formality and looking round her called several of the persons who were standing near <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were elderly gentlemen of what valentin de bellegarde had designated as the highnosed category two or three of them wore cordons and stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they approached with measured alertness and the marquise said that she wished to present them to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman who was going to marry her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she introduced successively three dukes three counts and a baron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these gentlemen bowed and smiled most agreeably and newman indulged in a series of impartial handshakes accompanied by a happy to make your acquaintance sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at madame de cintre but she was not looking at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if his personal selfconsciousness had been of a nature to make him constantly refer to her as the critic before whom in company he played his part he might have found it a flattering proof of her confidence that he never caught her eyes resting upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a reflection newman did not make but we nevertheless risk it that in spite of this circumstance she probably saw every movement of his little finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young madame de bellegarde was dressed in an audacious toilet of crimson crape bestrewn with huge silver moons thin crescent and full disks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont say anything about my dress she said to newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel he answered as if i were looking at you through a telescope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it is strange it matches the occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am not a heavenly body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw the sky at midnight that particular shade of crimson said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is my originality any one could have chosen blue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my sisterinlaw would have chosen a lovely shade of blue with a dozen little delicate moons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i think crimson is much more amusing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i give my idea which is moonshine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a murder by moonlight laughed madame de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a delicious idea for a toilet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make it complete there is the silver dagger you see stuck into my hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here comes lord deepmere she added in a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must find out what he thinks of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord deepmere came up looking very red in the face and laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord deepmere cant decide which he prefers my sisterinlaw or me said madame de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he likes claire because she is his cousin and me because i am not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he has no right to make love to claire whereas i am perfectly disponible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very wrong to make love to a woman who is engaged but it is very wrong not to make love to a woman who is married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh its very jolly making love to married women said lord deepmere because they cant ask you to marry them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is that what the others do the spinsters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh dear yes said lord deepmere in england all the girls ask a fellow to marry them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a fellow brutally refuses said madame de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why really you know a fellow cant marry any girl that asks him said his lordship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is going to marry mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh thats a very different thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would have accepted her i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that makes me hope that after all you prefer me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh when things are nice i never prefer one to the other said the young englishman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont be taken in that way i must be kept apart cried madame de bellegarde <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman is much better he knows how to choose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh he chooses as if he were threading a needle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he prefers madame de cintre to any conceivable creature or thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you cant help my being her cousin said lord deepmere to newman with candid hilarity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no i cant help that said newman laughing back neither can she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you cant help my dancing with her said lord deepmere with sturdy simplicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could prevent that only by dancing with her myself said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but unfortunately i dont know how to dance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh you may dance without knowing how may you not milord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to this lord deepmere replied that a fellow ought to know how to dance if he didnt want to make an ass of himself and at this moment urbain de bellegarde joined the group slowstepping and with his hands behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a very splendid entertainment said newman cheerfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old house looks very bright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are pleased we are content said the marquis lifting his shoulders and bending them forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i suspect every one is pleased said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can they help being pleased when the first thing they see as they come in is your sister standing there as beautiful as an angel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she is very beautiful rejoined the marquis solemnly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that is not so great a source of satisfaction to other people naturally as to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i am satisfied marquis i am satisfied said newman with his protracted enunciation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now tell me he added looking round who some of your friends are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde looked about him in silence with his head bent and his hand raised to his lower lip which he slowly rubbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stream of people had been pouring into the salon in which newman stood with his host the rooms were filling up and the spectacle had become brilliant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it borrowed its splendor chiefly from the shining shoulders and profuse jewels of the women and from the voluminous elegance of their dresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no uniforms as madame de bellegardes door was inexorably closed against the myrmidons of the upstart power which then ruled the fortunes of france and the great company of smiling and chattering faces was not graced by any very frequent suggestions of harmonious beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a pity nevertheless that newman had not been a physiognomist for a great many of the faces were irregularly agreeable expressive and suggestive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the occasion had been different they would hardly have pleased him he would have thought the women not pretty enough and the men too smirking but he was now in a humor to receive none but agreeable impressions and he looked no more narrowly than to perceive that every one was brilliant and to feel that the sun of their brilliancy was a part of his credit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will present you to some people said m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will make a point of it in fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i will shake hands with any one you want said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your mother just introduced me to half a dozen old gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take care you dont pick up the same parties again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who are the gentlemen to whom my mother presented you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon my word i forgot them said newman laughing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people here look very much alike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suspect they have not forgotten you said the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he began to walk through the rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman to keep near him in the crowd took his arm after which for some time the marquis walked straight along in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last reaching the farther end of the suite of receptionrooms newman found himself in the presence of a lady of monstrous proportions seated in a very capacious armchair with several persons standing in a semicircle round her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this little group had divided as the marquis came up and m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de bellegarde stepped forward and stood for an instant silent and obsequious with his hat raised to his lips as newman had seen some gentlemen stand in churches as soon as they entered their pews <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady indeed bore a very fair likeness to a reverend effigy in some idolatrous shrine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was monumentally stout and imperturbably serene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her aspect was to newman almost formidable he had a troubled consciousness of a triple chin a small piercing eye a vast expanse of uncovered bosom a nodding and twinkling tiara of plumes and gems and an immense circumference of satin petticoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with her little circle of beholders this remarkable woman reminded him of the fat lady at a fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she fixed her small unwinking eyes at the newcomers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear duchess said the marquis let me present you our good friend mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman of whom you have heard us speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman known to those who are dear to us i could not possibly fail to begin with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charmed dear friend charmed monsieur said the duchess in a voice which though small and shrill was not disagreeable while newman executed his obeisance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came on purpose to see monsieur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope he appreciates the compliment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have only to look at me to do so sir she continued sweeping her person with a muchencompassing glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman hardly knew what to say though it seemed that to a duchess who joked about her corpulence one might say almost anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on hearing that the duchess had come on purpose to see newman the gentlemen who surrounded her turned a little and looked at him with sympathetic curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis with supernatural gravity mentioned to him the name of each while the gentleman who bore it bowed they were all what are called in france beaux noms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted extremely to see you the duchess went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place i am very fond of the person you are going to marry she is the most charming creature in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mind you treat her well or you shall hear some news of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you look as if you were good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am told you are very remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard all sorts of extraordinary things about you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what you can have heard said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth a perturbing fact for he had no sense of competing with his young kinsman for eugenias good graces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame munsters uncle had the highest opinion of robert acton who indeed in the family at large was the object of a great deal of undemonstrative appreciation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were all proud of him in so far as the charge of being proud may be brought against people who were habitually distinctly guiltless of the misdemeanor known as taking credit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they never boasted of robert acton nor indulged in vainglorious reference to him they never quoted the clever things he had said nor mentioned the generous things he had done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a sort of frigidlytender faith in his unlimited goodness was a part of their personal sense of right and there can perhaps be no better proof of the high esteem in which he was held than the fact that no explicit judgment was ever passed upon his actions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was no more praised than he was blamed but he was tacitly felt to be an ornament to his circle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the man of the world of the family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been to china and brought home a collection of curiosities he had made a fortune or rather he had quintupled a fortune already considerable he was distinguished by that combination of celibacy property and good humor which appeals to even the most subdued imaginations and it was taken for granted that he would presently place these advantages at the disposal of some wellregulated young woman of his own set <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth was not a man to admit to himself thathis paternal duties apart he liked any individual much better than all other individuals but he thought robert acton extremely judicious and this was perhaps as near an approach as he was capable of to the eagerness of preference which his temperament repudiated as it would have disengaged itself from something slightly unchaste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton was in fact very judiciousand something more beside and indeed it must be claimed for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth that in the more illicit parts of his preference there hovered the vague adumbration of a belief that his cousins final merit was a certain enviable capacity for whistling rather gallantly at the sanctions of mere judgmentfor showing a larger courage a finer quality of pluck than common occasion demanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth would never have risked the intimation that acton was made in the smallest degree of the stuff of a hero but this is small blame to him for robert would certainly never have risked it himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton certainly exercised great discretion in all thingsbeginning with his estimate of himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that he was by no means so much of a man of the world as he was supposed to be in local circles but it must be added that he knew also that his natural shrewdness had a reach of which he had never quite given local circles the measure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was addicted to taking the humorous view of things and he had discovered that even in the narrowest circles such a disposition may find frequent opportunities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such opportunities had formed for some timethat is since his return from china a year and a half beforethe most active element in this gentlemans life which had just now a rather indolent air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was perfectly willing to get married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very fond of books and he had a handsome library that is his books were much more numerous than mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was also very fond of pictures but it must be confessed in the fierce light of contemporary criticism that his walls were adorned with several rather abortive masterpieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had got his learningand there was more of it than commonly appeared at harvard college and he took a pleasure in old associations which made it a part of his daily contentment to live so near this institution that he often passed it in driving to boston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was extremely interested in the baroness munster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was very frank with him or at least she intended to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure you find it very strange that i should have settled down in this outoftheway part of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said to him three or four weeks after she had installed herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am certain you are wondering about my motives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness by this time was an old inhabitant the best society in boston had called upon her and clifford wentworth had taken her several times to drive in his buggy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robert acton was seated near her playing with a fan there were always several fans lying about her drawingroom with long ribbons of different colors attached to them and acton was always playing with one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i dont find it at all strange he said slowly smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that a clever woman should turn up in boston or its suburbsthat does not require so much explanation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boston is a very nice place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wish to make me contradict you said the baroness vous vous y prenez mal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in certain moods there is nothing i am not capable of agreeing to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boston is a paradise and we are in the suburbs of paradise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just now i am not at all in the suburbs i am in the place itself rejoined acton who was lounging a little in his chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was however not always lounging and when he was he was not quite so relaxed as he pretended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to a certain extent he sought refuge from shyness in this appearance of relaxation and like many persons in the same circumstances he somewhat exaggerated the appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond this the air of being much at his ease was a cover for vigilant observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was more than interested in this clever woman who whatever he might say was clever not at all after the boston fashion she plunged him into a kind of excitement held him in vague suspense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was obliged to admit to himself that he had never yet seen a woman just like thisnot even in china <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was ashamed for inscrutable reasons of the vivacity of his emotion and he carried it off superficially by taking still superficially the humorous view of madame munster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not at all true that he thought it very natural of her to have made this pious pilgrimage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might have been said of him in advance that he was too good a bostonian to regard in the light of an eccentricity the desire of even the remotest alien to visit the new england metropolis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was an impulse for which surely no apology was needed and madame munster was the fortunate possessor of several new england cousins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact however madame munster struck him as out of keeping with her little circle she was at the best a very agreeable a gracefully mystifying anomaly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew very well that it would not do to address these reflections too crudely to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth he would never have remarked to the old gentleman that he wondered what the baroness was up to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and indeed he had no great desire to share his vague mistrust with any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a personal pleasure in it the greatest pleasure he had known at least since he had come from china <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would keep the baroness for better or worse to himself he had a feeling that he deserved to enjoy a monopoly of her for he was certainly the person who had most adequately gauged her capacity for social intercourse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before long it became apparent to him that the baroness was disposed to lay no tax upon such a monopoly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day he was sitting there again and playing with a fan she asked him to apologize should the occasion present itself to certain people in boston for her not having returned their calls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are half a dozen places she said a formidable list <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charlotte wentworth has written it out for me in a terrifically distinct hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no ambiguity on the subject i know perfectly where i must go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth informs me that the carriage is always at my disposal and charlotte offers to go with me in a pair of tight gloves and a very stiff petticoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet for three days i have been putting it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they must think me horribly vicious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ask me to apologize said acton but you dont tell me what excuse i can offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is more the baroness declared than i am held to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be like my asking you to buy me a bouquet and giving you the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no reason except thatsomehowit s too violent an effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would nt that serve as an excuse in boston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am told they are very sincere they dont tell fibs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then felix ought to go with me and he is never in readiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is always roaming about the fields and sketching old barns or taking tenmile walks or painting some ones portrait or rowing on the pond or flirting with gertrude wentworth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think it would amuse you to go and see a few people said acton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are having a very quiet time of it here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it s a dull life for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that s what i came here for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as for seeing peoplei have already seen a great many in my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it did nt sound ungracious i should say that i wish very humbly your people here would leave me alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton looked at her a moment and she looked at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a woman who took being looked at remarkably well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you have come here for rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came for many of those reasons that are no reasonsdont you know?and yet that are really the best to come away to change to break with everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when once one comes away one must arrive somewhere and i asked myself why i should nt arrive here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you certainly had time on the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame munster looked at him again and then smiling and i have certainly had time since i got here to ask myself why i came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however i never ask myself idle questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here i am and it seems to me you ought only to thank me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you go away you will see the difficulties i shall put in your path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean to put difficulties in my path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked rearranging the rosebud in her corsage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i shall be unable to depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have left some very agreeable people over there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah said acton but it was to come here where i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did nt know of your existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me for saying anything so rude but honestly speaking i did not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no the baroness pursued it was precisely not to see yousuch people as youthat i came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a sort of longing to come into those natural relations which i knew i should find here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over there i had only as i may say artificial relations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the difference tells against me said acton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i am an artificial relation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conventional declared the baroness very conventional <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well there is one way in which the relation of a lady and a gentleman may always become natural said acton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean by their becoming lovers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that may be natural or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at any rate rejoined eugenia nous nen sommes pas la <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not as yet but a little later when she began to go with him to drive it might almost have seemed that they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came for her several times alone in his high wagon drawn by a pair of charming lightlimbed horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was different her having gone with clifford wentworth who was her cousin and so much younger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not to be imagined that she should have a flirtation with clifford who was a mere shamefaced boy and whom a large section of boston society supposed to be engaged to lizzie acton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not indeed that it was to be conceived that the baroness was a possible party to any flirtation whatever for she was undoubtedly a married lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was generally known that her matrimonial condition was of the morganatic order but in its natural aversion to suppose that this meant anything less than absolute wedlock the conscience of the community took refuge in the belief that it implied something even more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton wished her to think highly of american scenery and he drove her to great distances picking out the prettiest roads and the largest points of view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we are good when we are contented eugenias virtues should now certainly have been uppermost for she found a charm in the rapid movement through a wild country and in a companion who from time to time made the vehicle dip with a motion like a swallows flight over roads of primitive construction and who as she felt would do a great many things that she might ask him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes for a couple of hours together there were almost no houses there were nothing but woods and rivers and lakes and horizons adorned with brightlooking mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to the baroness very wild as i have said and lovely but the impression added something to that sense of the enlargement of opportunity which had been born of her arrival in the new world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one dayit was late in the afternoonacton pulled up his horses on the crest of a hill which commanded a beautiful prospect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he let them stand a long time to rest while he sat there and talked with madame m auunster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prospect was beautiful in spite of there being nothing human within sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a wilderness of woods and the gleam of a distant river and a glimpse of half the hilltops in massachusetts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the road had a wide grassy margin on the further side of which there flowed a deep clear brook there were wild flowers in the grass and beside the brook lay the trunk of a fallen tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton waited a while at last a rustic wayfarer came trudging along the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton asked him to hold the horses a service he consented to render as a friendly turn to a fellowcitizen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he invited the baroness to descend and the two wandered away across the grass and sat down on the log beside the brook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i imagine it does nt remind you of silberstadt said acton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time that he had mentioned silberstadt to her for particular reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew she had a husband there and this was disagreeable to him and furthermore it had been repeated to him that this husband wished to put her awaya state of affairs to which even indirect reference was to be deprecated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was true nevertheless that the baroness herself had often alluded to silberstadt and acton had often wondered why her husband wished to get rid of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a curious position for a lady this being known as a repudiated wife and it is worthy of observation that the baroness carried it off with exceeding grace and dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had made it felt from the first that there were two sides to the question and that her own side when she should choose to present it would be replete with touching interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it does not remind me of the town of course she said of the sculptured gables and the gothic churches of the wonderful schloss with its moat and its clustering towers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it has a little look of some other parts of the principality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one might fancy ones self among those grand old german forests those legendary mountains the sort of country one sees from the windows at shreckenstein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a great castlethe summer residence of the reigning prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have stayed there said the baroness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton was silent he looked a while at the uncastled landscape before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the first time you have ever asked me about silberstadt she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think you would want to know about my marriage it must seem to you very strange <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton looked at her a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you would nt like me to say that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you americans have such odd ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you never ask anything outright there seem to be so many things you cant talk about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we americans are very polite said acton whose national consciousness had been complicated by a residence in foreign lands and who yet disliked to hear americans abused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont like to tread upon peoples toes he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i should like very much to hear about your marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now tell me how it came about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prince fell in love with me replied the baroness simply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pressed his suit very hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first he did nt wish me to marry him on the contrary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on that basis i refused to listen to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he offered me marriagein so far as he might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was young and i confess i was rather flattered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if it were to be done again now i certainly should not accept him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should never ask a woman for dates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i should think that when a woman was relating history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he wants to break it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they want him to make a political marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they must be a precious pair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness gave a little philosophic shrug <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they think they are treating me very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silberstadt is a perfectly despotic little state and the reigning prince may annul the marriage by a stroke of his pen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he has promised me nevertheless not to do so without my formal consent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is an indignity and i have wished at least to make it difficult for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have a little document in my writingdesk which i have only to sign and send back to the prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it will be all over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness lifted her hand and dropped it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i shall keep my title at least i shall be at liberty to keep it if i choose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i suppose i shall keep it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i shall keep my pension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very smallit is wretchedly small but it is what i live on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you have only to sign that paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness looked at him a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got up slowly and stood with his hands in his pockets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you gain by not doing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am supposed to gain this advantagethat if i delay or temporize the prince may come back to me may make a stand against his brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is very fond of me and his brother has pushed him only little by little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he were to come back to you said acton would you would you take him back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness met his eyes she colored just a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have the satisfaction of saying now it is my turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i break with your serene highness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they began to walk toward the carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said robert acton it s a curious story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how did you make his acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was staying with an old ladyan old countessin dresden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been a friend of my fathers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father was dead i was very much alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my brother was wandering about the world in a theatrical troupe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your brother ought to have stayed with you acton observed and kept you from putting your trust in princes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness was silent a moment and then he did what he could she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old countess encouraged the prince she was even pressing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me madame munster added gently thatunder the circumstances i behaved very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton glanced at her and made the observationhe had made it before that a woman looks the prettier for having unfolded her wrongs or her sufferings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he reflected audibly i should like to see you send his serene highnesssomewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame munster stooped and plucked a daisy from the grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont knowi dont know said acton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one case i should have my revenge in another case i should have my liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton gave a little laugh as he helped her into the carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate he said take good care of that paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a couple of days afterward he asked her to come and see his house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the visit had already been proposed but it had been put off in consequence of his mothers illness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a constant invalid and she had passed these recent years very patiently in a great flowered armchair at her bedroom window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lately for some days she had been unable to see any one but now she was better and she sent the baroness a very civil message <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton had wished their visitor to come to dinner but madame m auunster preferred to begin with a simple call <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had reflected that if she should go to dinner mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth and his daughters would also be asked and it had seemed to her that the peculiar character of the occasion would be best preserved in a teteatete with her host <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the occasion should have a peculiar character she explained to no one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as far as any one could see it was simply very pleasant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton came for her and drove her to his door an operation which was rapidly performed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his house the baroness mentally pronounced a very good one more articulately she declared that it was enchanting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was large and square and painted brown it stood in a wellkept shrubbery and was approached from the gate by a short drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was moreover a much more modern dwelling than mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworths and was more redundantly upholstered and expensively ornamented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness perceived that her entertainer had analyzed material comfort to a sufficiently fine point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he possessed the most delightful chinoiseriestrophies of his sojourn in the celestial empire pagodas of ebony and cabinets of ivory sculptured monsters grinning and leering on chimneypieces in front of beautifully figured handscreens porcelain dinnersets gleaming behind the glass doors of mahogany buffets large screens in corners covered with tense silk and embroidered with mandarins and dragons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these things were scattered all over the house and they gave eugenia a pretext for a complete domiciliary visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she liked it she enjoyed it she thought it a very nice place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had a mixture of the homely and the liberal and though it was almost a museum the large littleused rooms were as fresh and clean as a wellkept dairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lizzie acton told her that she dusted all the pagodas and other curiosities every day with her own hands and the baroness answered that she was evidently a household fairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lizzie had not at all the look of a young lady who dusted things she wore such pretty dresses and had such delicate fingers that it was difficult to imagine her immersed in sordid cares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she came to meet madame m auunster on her arrival but she said nothing or almost nothing and the baroness again reflected she had had occasion to do so beforethat american girls had no manners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she disliked this little american girl and she was quite prepared to learn that she had failed to commend herself to miss acton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lizzie struck her as positive and explicit almost to pertness and the idea of her combining the apparent incongruities of a taste for housework and the wearing of fresh parisianlooking dresses suggested the possession of a dangerous energy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a source of irritation to the baroness that in this country it should seem to matter whether a little girl were a trifle less or a trifle more of a nonentity for eugenia had hitherto been conscious of no moral pressure as regards the appreciation of diminutive virgins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was perhaps an indication of lizzies pertness that she very soon retired and left the baroness on her brothers hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton talked a great deal about his chinoiseries he knew a good deal about porcelain and bricabrac <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness in her progress through the house made as it were a great many stations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat down everywhere confessed to being a little tired and asked about the various objects with a curious mixture of alertness and inattention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there had been any one to say it to she would have declared that she was positively in love with her host but she could hardly make this declarationeven in the strictest confidenceto acton himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it gave her nevertheless a pleasure that had some of the charm of unwontedness to feel with that admirable keenness with which she was capable of feeling things that he had a disposition without any edges that even his humorous irony always expanded toward the point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ones impression of his honesty was almost like carrying a bunch of flowers the perfume was most agreeable but they were occasionally an inconvenience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could trust him at any rate round all the corners of the world and withal he was not absolutely simple which would have been excess he was only relatively simple which was quite enough for the baroness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lizzie reappeared to say that her mother would now be happy to receive madame munster and the baroness followed her to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eugenia reflected as she went that it was not the affectation of impertinence that made her dislike this young lady for on that ground she could easily have beaten her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not an aspiration on the girls part to rivalry but a kind of laughing childishlymocking indifference to the results of comparison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton was an emaciated sweetfaced woman of five and fifty sitting with pillows behind her and looking out on a clump of hemlocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was very modest very timid and very ill she made eugenia feel grateful that she herself was not like that neither so ill nor possibly so modest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a chair beside her lay a volume of emersons essays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a great occasion for poor mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton in her helpless condition to be confronted with a clever foreign lady who had more manner than any ladyany dozen ladies that she had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard a great deal about you she said softly to the baroness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has talked to me immensely of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh he talks of you as you would like the baroness declared as such a son must talk of such a mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton sat gazing this was part of madame munsters manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but robert acton was gazing too in vivid consciousness that he had barely mentioned his mother to their brilliant guest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never talked of this still maternal presencea presence refined to such delicacy that it had almost resolved itself with him simply into the subjective emotion of gratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and acton rarely talked of his emotions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness turned her smile toward him and she instantly felt that she had been observed to be fibbing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had struck a false note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but who were these people to whom such fibbing was not pleasing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they were annoyed the baroness was equally so and after the exchange of a few civil inquiries and lowvoiced responses she took leave of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she begged robert not to come home with her she would get into the carriage alone she preferred that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was imperious and she thought he looked disappointed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while she stood before the door with himthe carriage was turning in the gravelwalkthis thought restored her serenity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had given him her hand in farewell she looked at him a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have almost decided to dispatch that paper she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that she alluded to the document that she had called her renunciation and he assisted her into the carriage without saying anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but just before the vehicle began to move he said well when you have in fact dispatched it i hope you will let me know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix young finished gertrudes portrait and he afterwards transferred to canvas the features of many members of that circle of which it may be said that he had become for the time the pivot and the centre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid it must be confessed that he was a decidedly flattering painter and that he imparted to his models a romantic grace which seemed easily and cheaply acquired by the payment of a hundred dollars to a young man who made sitting so entertaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for felix was paid for his pictures making as he did no secret of the fact that in guiding his steps to the western world affectionate curiosity had gone hand in hand with a desire to better his condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took his uncles portrait quite as if mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth had never averted himself from the experiment and as he compassed his end only by the exercise of gentle violence it is but fair to add that he allowed the old man to give him nothing but his time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he passed his arm into mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworths one summer morning very few arms indeed had ever passed into mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworthsand led him across the garden and along the road into the studio which he had extemporized in the little house among the appletrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grave gentleman felt himself more and more fascinated by his clever nephew whose fresh demonstrative youth seemed a compendium of experiences so strangely numerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeared to him that felix must know a great deal he would like to learn what he thought about some of those things as regards which his own conversation had always been formal but his knowledge vague <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix had a confident gayly trenchant way of judging human actions which mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth grew little by little to envy it seemed like criticism made easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forming an opinionsay on a persons conductwas with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth a good deal like fumbling in a lock with a key chosen at hazard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to himself to go about the world with a big bunch of these ineffectual instruments at his girdle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his nephew on the other hand with a single turn of the wrist opened any door as adroitly as a horsethief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt obliged to keep up the convention that an uncle is always wiser than a nephew even if he could keep it up no otherwise than by listening in serious silence to felixs quick light constant discourse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there came a day when he lapsed from consistency and almost asked his nephews advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you ever entertained the idea of settling in the united states <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked one morning while felix brilliantly plied his brush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear uncle said felix excuse me if your question makes me smile a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to begin with i have never entertained an idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ideas often entertain me but i am afraid i have never seriously made a plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what you are going to say or rather i know what you think for i dont think you will say it that this is very frivolous and looseminded on my part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it is but i am made like that i take things as they come and somehow there is always some new thing to follow the last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the second place i should never propose to settle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant settle my dear uncle i m not a settler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know that is what strangers are supposed to do here they always settle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have ntto answer your question entertained that idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you intend to return to europe and resume your irregular manner of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it s very likely i shall go back to europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all i am a european <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will depend a good deal upon my sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she s even more of a european than i here you know she s a picture out of her setting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as for resuming dear uncle i really have never given up my irregular manner of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what for me could be more irregular than this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> living in the midst of you this way this charming quiet serious family life fraternizing with charlotte and gertrude calling upon twenty young ladies and going out to walk with them sitting with you in the evening on the piazza and listening to the crickets and going to bed at ten oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your description is very animated said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth but i see nothing improper in what you describe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is extremely delightful i should nt like it if it were improper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you i dont like improper things though i dare say you think i do felix went on painting away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never accused you of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray dont said felix because you see at bottom i am a terrible philistine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean as one may say a plain godfearing man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth looked at him reservedly like a mystified sage and felix continued i trust i shall enjoy a venerable and venerated old age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can hardly call that a plan perhaps but it s a keen desirea rosy vision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall be a lively perhaps even a frivolous old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is natural said his uncle sententiously that one should desire to prolong an agreeable life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have perhaps a selfish indisposition to bring our pleasure to a close <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i presume he added that you expect to marry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that too dear uncle is a hope a desire a vision said felix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it occurred to him for an instant that this was possibly a preface to the offer of the hand of one of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the name of decent modesty and a proper sense of the hard realities of this world felix banished the thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his uncle was the incarnation of benevolence certainly but from that to acceptingmuch more postulatingthe idea of a union between a young lady with a dowry presumptively brilliant and a penniless artist with no prospect of fame there was a very long way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix had lately become conscious of a luxurious preference for the societyif possible unshared with othersof gertrude wentworth but he had relegated this young lady for the moment to the coldly brilliant category of unattainable possessions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not the first woman for whom he had entertained an unpractical admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been in love with duchesses and countesses and he had made once or twice a perilously near approach to cynicism in declaring that the disinterestedness of women had been overrated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the whole he had tempered audacity with modesty and it is but fair to him now to say explicitly that he would have been incapable of taking advantage of his present large allowance of familiarity to make love to the younger of his handsome cousins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix had grown up among traditions in the light of which such a proceeding looked like a grievous breach of hospitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have said that he was always happy and it may be counted among the present sources of his happiness that he had as regards this matter of his relations with gertrude a deliciously good conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his own deportment seemed to him suffused with the beauty of virtue a form of beauty that he admired with the same vivacity with which he admired all other forms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think that if you marry said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth presently it will conduce to your happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix exclaimed and then arresting his brush he looked at his uncle with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is something i feel tempted to say to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth drew himself up a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very safe i dont repeat things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he hoped felix would not risk too much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix was laughing at his answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it s odd to hear you telling me how to be happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think you know yourself dear uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man was silent a moment and then with a dry dignity that suddenly touched his nephew we may sometimes point out a road we are unable to follow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah dont tell me you have had any sorrows felix rejoined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did nt suppose it and i did nt mean to allude to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply meant that you all dont amuse yourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have reached the proper age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was saying that the other day to gertrude felix added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope it was not indiscreet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth with a keener irony than felix would have thought him capable of it was but your way of amusing yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid you have never had a trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix declared with some spirit before i knew better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you dont catch me at it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth maintained for a while a silence more expressive than a deepdrawn sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have no children he said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont tell me felix exclaimed that your charming young people are a source of grief to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then after a pause mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth continued i dont speak of gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i feel considerable anxiety about clifford <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell you another time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next time he gave felix a sitting his nephew reminded him that he had taken him into his confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has always seemed to me a young man of remarkable discretion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed he is only too discreet he seems on his guard against me as if he thought me rather light company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other day he told his sister gertrude repeated it to methat i was always laughing at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i laugh it is simply from the impulse to try and inspire him with confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the only way i have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cliffords situation is no laughing matter said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very peculiar as i suppose you have guessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah you mean his love affair with his cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean his absence from college <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have decided not to speak of it unless we are asked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has been requested by the harvard authorities to absent himself for six months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile he is studying with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand will help him at least we hope so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was too fond of pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand certainly will not teach him any of those secrets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was too fond of something of which he should not have been fond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose it is considered a pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear uncle is there any doubt about its being a pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cest de son age as they say in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have said rather it was a vice of later life of disappointed old age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix glanced at his uncle with his lifted eyebrows and then of what are you speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the situation in which clifford was found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah he was foundhe was caught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could nt walk he staggered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rather suspected that from something i observed the first day i came here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i quite agree with you that it is a low taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it s not a vice for a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ought to give it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hope for a good deal from mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has talked to him from the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he never touches anything himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will talk to himi will talk to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what will you say to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked his uncle with some apprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix for some moments answered nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to marry him to his cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should nt think his cousin would want to marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have no understanding then with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never discussed such subjects with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think it might be time said felix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lizzie acton is admirably pretty and if clifford is dangerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not engaged said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no reason to suppose they are engaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trust me clifford as i say is a charming boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lizzie acton then would not be jealous of another woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i certainly hope not said the old man with a vague sense of jealousy being an even lower vice than a love of liquor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the best thing for clifford then felix propounded is to become interested in some clever charming woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he paused in his painting and with his elbows on his knees looked with bright communicativeness at his uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i believe greatly in the influence of women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> living with women helps to make a man a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very true clifford has his sisters who are so charming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there should be a different sentiment in play from the fraternal you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has lizzie acton but she perhaps is rather immature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suspect lizzie has talked to him reasoned with him said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the impropriety of getting tipsyon the beauty of temperance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is dreary work for a pretty young girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no felix continued clifford ought to frequent some agreeable woman who without ever mentioning such unsavory subjects would give him a sense of its being very ridiculous to be fuddled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he could fall in love with her a little so much the better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing would operate as a cure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well now what lady should you suggest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a clever woman under your hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is well disposed already he has invited her two or three times to drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont think he comes to see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give him a hint to come to come often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will sit there of an afternoon and they will talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think she will exercise a helpful influence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she will exercise a civilizingi may call it a soberinginfluence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a charming clever witty woman always doesespecially if she is a little of a coquette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear uncle the society of such women has been half my education <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if clifford is suspended as you say from college let eugenia be his preceptress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think eugenia is a coquette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth could at the best have been no answer for he did not think his niece pretty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with clifford the young man pursued eugenia will simply be enough of a coquette to be a little ironical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you recommend him to be nice with her you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the suggestion will come best from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do i understand asked the old man that i am to suggest to my son to make aa profession ofof affection to madame munster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as i understand it madame munster is a married woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah said felix smiling of course she cant marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she will do what she can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth sat for some time with his eyes on the floor at last he got up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think he said that i can undertake to recommend my son any such course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and without meeting felixs surprised glance he broke off his sitting which was not resumed for a fortnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix was very fond of the little lake which occupied so many of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworths numerous acres and of a remarkable pine grove which lay upon the further side of it planted upon a steep embankment and haunted by the summer breeze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the murmur of the air in the far off treetops had a strange distinctness it was almost articulate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one afternoon the young man came out of his paintingroom and passed the open door of eugenias little salon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within in the cool dimness he saw his sister dressed in white buried in her armchair and holding to her face an immense bouquet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> opposite to her sat clifford wentworth twirling his hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had evidently just presented the bouquet to the baroness whose fine eyes as she glanced at him over the big roses and geraniums wore a conversational smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix standing on the threshold of the cottage hesitated for a moment as to whether he should retrace his steps and enter the parlor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he went his way and passed into mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that civilizing process to which he had suggested that clifford should be subjected appeared to have come on of itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix was very sure at least that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth had not adopted his ingenious device for stimulating the young mans aesthetic consciousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless he supposes he said to himself after the conversation that has been narrated that i desire out of fraternal benevolence to procure for eugenia the amusement of a flirtationor as he probably calls it an intriguewith the too susceptible clifford <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be admittedand i have noticed it beforethat nothing exceeds the license occasionally taken by the imagination of very rigid people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix on his own side had of course said nothing to clifford but he had observed to eugenia that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth was much mortified at his sons low tastes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we ought to do something to help them after all their kindness to us he had added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> encourage clifford to come and see you and inspire him with a taste for conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will supplant the other which only comes from his puerility from his not taking his position in the world that of a rich young man of ancient stockseriously enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> make him a little more serious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if he makes love to you it is no great matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am to offer myself as a superior form of intoxication a substitute for a brandy bottle eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> truly in this country one comes to strange uses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she had not positively declined to undertake cliffords higher education and felix who had not thought of the matter again being haunted with visions of more personal profit now reflected that the work of redemption had fairly begun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea in prospect had seemed of the happiest but in operation it made him a trifle uneasy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what if eugeniawhat if eugenia he asked himself softly the question dying away in his sense of eugenias undetermined capacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before felix had time either to accept or to reject its admonition even in this vague form he saw robert acton turn out of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworths inclosure by a distant gate and come toward the cottage in the orchard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton had evidently walked from his own house along a shady byway and was intending to pay a visit to madame munster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix watched him a moment then he turned away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acton could be left to play the part of providence and interrupt if interruption were neededcliffords entanglement with eugenia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix passed through the garden toward the house and toward a postern gate which opened upon a path leading across the fields beside a little wood to the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped and looked up at the house his eyes rested more particularly upon a certain open window on the shady side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently gertrude appeared there looking out into the summer light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took off his hat to her and bade her goodday he remarked that he was going to row across the pond and begged that she would do him the honor to accompany him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him a moment then without saying anything she turned away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she soon reappeared below in one of those quaint and charming leghorn hats tied with white satin bows that were worn at that period she also carried a green parasol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went with him to the edge of the lake where a couple of boats were always moored they got into one of them and felix with gentle strokes propelled it to the opposite shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day was the perfection of summer weather the little lake was the color of sunshine the plash of the oars was the only sound and they found themselves listening to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they disembarked and by a winding path ascended the pinecrested mound which overlooked the water whose white expanse glittered between the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place was delightfully cool and had the added charm that in the softly sounding pine boughsyou seemed to hear the coolness as well as feel it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix and gertrude sat down on the rustcolored carpet of pineneedles and talked of many things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix spoke at last in the course of talk of his going away it was the first time he had alluded to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some daywhen the leaves begin to fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know i cant stay forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude transferred her eyes to the outer prospect and then after a pause she said i shall never see you again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall probably both survive my departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but gertrude only repeated i shall never see you again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall never hear of you she went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall know nothing about you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew nothing about you before and it will be the same again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew nothing about you then unfortunately said felix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now i shall write to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall not answer you gertrude declared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should of course burn your letters said felix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not strange in themselves the young man answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are only strange as said to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked this question simply she was very much in earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix was interested in her earnestness for some moments he hesitated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant tell me that she pursued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant say that i shall go with my father and my sister you dont believe that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall keep your letters said felix presently for all answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how to write <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude for some time said nothing more and her companion as he looked at her wished it had not been disloyal to make love to the daughter of an old gentleman who had offered one hospitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the afternoon waned the shadows stretched themselves and the light grew deeper in the western sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two persons appeared on the opposite side of the lake coming from the house and crossing the meadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand only came down to the edge of the water and stood there looking across they made no motion to enter the boat that felix had left at the mooringplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix waved his hat to them it was too far to call <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they made no visible response and they presently turned away and walked along the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand is not demonstrative said felix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is never demonstrative to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sits silent with his chin in his hand looking at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father tells me he is so eloquent and i should like to hear him talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looks like such a noble young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but with me he will never talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet i am so fond of listening to brilliant imagery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is very eloquent said gertrude but he has no brilliant imagery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard him talk a great deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that when they saw us they would not come over here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah he is making la cour as they say to your sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said gertrude gravely they have no such reason as that for being alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but why does nt he make la cour to charlotte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is so pretty so gentle so good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude glanced at him and then she looked at the distantlyseen couple they were discussing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand and charlotte were walking side by side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they might have been a pair of lovers and yet they might not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they think i should not be here said gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you did nt have those ideas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are a great many things you dont understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but why then do not charlotte and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand who as an elder sister and a clergyman are free to walk about together come over and make me wiser by breaking up the unlawful interview into which i have lured you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the last thing they would do said gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix stared at her a moment with his lifted eyebrows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed then his eyes followed for a while the retreating figures of this critical pair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may say what you please he declared it is evident to me that your sister is not indifferent to her clever companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is agreeable to her to be walking there with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can see that from here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the excitement of observation felix rose to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude rose also but she made no attempt to emulate her companions discovery she looked rather in another direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felixs words had struck her but a certain delicacy checked her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is certainly not indifferent to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand she has the highest opinion of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one can see itone can see it said felix in a tone of amused contemplation with his head on one side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude turned her back to the opposite shore it was disagreeable to her to look but she hoped felix would say something more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah they have wandered away into the wood he added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is not in love with him she said it seemed her duty to say that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he is in love with her or if he is not he ought to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is such a perfect little woman of her kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reminds me of a pair of oldfashioned silver sugartongs you know i am very fond of sugar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she is very nice with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand i have noticed that very gentle and gracious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she took a great resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wants him to marry me she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so of course she is nice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felixs eyebrows rose higher than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you think one must be very nice with a man to induce him to do that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude had turned a little pale but she went on mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix folded his arms and stood looking at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seei see he said quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did you never tell me this before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is disagreeable to me to speak of it even now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wished simply to explain to you about charlotte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont wish to marry mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and does your father wish it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you dont like himyou have refused him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont wish to marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father and sister think you ought to eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a long story said gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they think there are good reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they think i have obligations and that i have encouraged him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix smiled at her as if she had been telling him an amusing story about some one else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell you how this interests me he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now you dont recognize these reasonsthese obligations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not sure it is not easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she picked up her parasol and turned away as if to descend the slope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me this felix went on going with her are you likely to give in to let them persuade you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude looked at him with the serious face that she had constantly worn in opposition to his almost eager smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they slowly descended the hill together saying nothing till they reached the margin of the pond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is your own affair he then resumed but do you know i am not altogether glad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it were settled that you were to marry mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand i should take a certain comfort in the arrangement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no right to make love to you myself eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he paused lightly pressing his argument upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none whatever replied gertrude quicklytoo quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father would never hear of it i have nt a penny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand of course has property of his own eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe he has some property but that has nothing to do with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with you of course not but with your father and sister it must have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so as i say if this were settled i should feel more at liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix untwisted the rope and stood holding it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should be able to say things to you that i cant give myself the pleasure of saying now he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could tell you how much i admire you without seeming to pretend to that which i have no right to pretend to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should make violent love to you he added laughing if i thought you were so placed as not to be offended by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean if i were engaged to another man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that case you would not take me seriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i take every one seriously said gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and without his help she stepped lightly into the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix took up the oars and sent it forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah this is what you have been thinking about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me you had something on your mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish very much he added that you would tell me some of these socalled reasonsthese obligations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not real reasonsgood reasons said gertrude looking at the pink and yellow gleams in the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because a handsome girl has had a spark of coquetry that is no reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you mean me it s not that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is something that troubles you at any rate said felix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not so much as it used to gertrude rejoined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at her smiling always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is not saying much eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she only rested her eyes very gravely on the lighted water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to him to be trying to hide the signs of the trouble of which she had just told him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix felt at all times much the same impulse to dissipate visible melancholy that a good housewife feels to brush away dust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something he wished to brush away now suddenly he stopped rowing and poised his oars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand have addressed himself to you and not to your sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure she would listen to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude in her family was thought capable of a good deal of levity but her levity had never gone so far as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it moved her greatly however to hear felix say that he was sure of something so that raising her eyes toward him she tried intently for some moments to conjure up this wonderful image of a loveaffair between her own sister and her own suitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know that gertrude had an imaginative mind so that it is not impossible that this effort should have been partially successful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she only murmured ah felix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they will leave you alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will help you as far as i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrudes heart began to beat she was greatly excited she had never had anything so interesting proposed to her before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix had begun to row again and he now sent the boat home with long strokes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe she does care for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said gertrude after they had disembarked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course she does and we will marry them off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will make them happy it will make every one happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall have a wedding and i will write an epithalamium <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems as if it would make me happy said gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to see my sister married to so good a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you always put things on those grounds you will never say anything for yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are all so afraid here of being selfish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think you know how he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will make me happy for myself and for just the reverse of what i told you a while ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that when i make love to you you will have to think i mean it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall never think you mean anything said gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah cried felix that s a license to say everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand had not returned when they reached the house but the baroness had come to tea and robert acton also who now regularly asked for a place at this generous repast or made his appearance later in the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clifford wentworth with his juvenile growl remarked upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are always coming to tea nowadays robert he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think you had drunk enough tea in china <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems as if you were a kind of attraction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i am a curiosity said the baroness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me time and i will make you a salon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would fall to pieces after you go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont talk about her going in that familiar way clifford said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth glanced at his son and taking note of these words wondered if felix had been teaching him according to the programme he had sketched out to make love to the wife of a german prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charlotte came in late with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand but gertrude to whom at least felix had taught something looked in vain in her face for the traces of a guilty passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand sat down by gertrude and she presently asked him why they had not crossed the pond to join felix and herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is cruel of you to ask me that he answered very softly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a large morsel of cake before him but he fingered it without eating it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sometimes think you are growing cruel he added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude said nothing she was afraid to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a kind of rage in her heart she felt as if she could easily persuade herself that she was persecuted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said to herself that it was quite right that she should not allow him to make her believe she was wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought of what felix had said to her she wished indeed mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked away from him and spoke no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand ended by eating his cake while felix sat opposite describing to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth the students duels at heidelberg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after tea they all dispersed themselves as usual upon the piazza and in the garden and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand drew near to gertrude again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did nt come to you this afternoon because you were not alone he began because you were with a newer friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is an old friend by this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand looked at the ground for some moments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i was prepared to hear you speak in that way he resumed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i find it very painful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see what else i can say said gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand walked beside her for a while in silence gertrude wished he would go away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i think i ought to advise you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i know your nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you dont said gertrude with a soft laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you make yourself out worse than you areto please him mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand stopped also and with the same soft straightforwardness he does nt care for the things you care forthe great questions of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude with her eyes on his shook her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care for the great questions of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a time when you did nt say that said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh rejoined gertrude i think you made me talk a great deal of nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it depends she added upon what you call the great questions of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some things i care for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are they the things you talk about with your cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should not say things to me against my cousin mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened to this respectfully then he answered with a little vibration of the voice i should be very sorry to do anything dishonorable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont see why it is dishonorable to say that your cousin is frivolous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go and say it to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think he would admit it said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the tone he would take <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not be ashamed of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i am not ashamed of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is probably what i like him for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are trying as i said just now to lower yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am trying for once to be natural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been pretending all my life i have been dishonest it is you that have made me so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand stood gazing at her and she went on why should nt i be frivolous if i want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one has a right to be frivolous if it s ones nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i dont care for the great questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps i am fond of wicked things it is very possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand remained staring he was even a little pale as if he had been frightened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think you know what you are saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is only with you that i talk nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never do so with my cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will speak to you again when you are less excited said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am always excited when you speak to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must tell you that even if it prevents you altogether in future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your speaking to me irritates me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with my cousin it is very different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at her and then he looked away with a kind of helpless distress at the dusky garden and the faint summer stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after which suddenly turning back gertrude gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was touchedshe was pained but it had already occurred to her that she might do something better than say so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would not have alleviated her companions distress to perceive just then whence she had sympathetically borrowed this ingenuity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not sorry for you gertrude said for in paying so much attention to me you are following a shadowyou are wasting something precious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is something else you might have that you dont look at something better than i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then with intention she looked at him and tried to smile a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought this smile of hers very strange but she turned away and left him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wandered about alone in the garden wondering what mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand would make of her words which it had been a singular pleasure for her to utter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shortly after passing in front of the house she saw at a distance two persons standing near the garden gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand going away and bidding goodnight to charlotte who had walked down with him from the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude saw that the parting was prolonged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she turned her back upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not gone very far however when she heard her sister slowly following her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she neither turned round nor waited for her she knew what charlotte was going to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charlotte who at last overtook her in fact presently began she had passed her arm into gertrudes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you listen to me dear if i say something very particular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what you are going to say said gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh gertrude how can you treat him so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as her sister made no answer she added after all he has done for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what has he done for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder you can ask gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you told me so yourself a great many times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you told me that he helped you to struggle with youryour peculiarities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you told me that he had taught you how to govern your temper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment gertrude said nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then was my temper very bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not accusing you gertrude said charlotte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her sister demanded with a short laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brandreminding you of all you owe him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have given it all back said gertrude still with her little laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can take back the virtue he imparted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to be wicked again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her sister made her stop in the path and fixed upon her in the darkness a sweet reproachful gaze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you talk this way i shall almost believe it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think of all we owe mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think of how he has always expected something of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think how much he has been to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think of his beautiful influence upon clifford <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is very good said gertrude looking at her sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know he is very good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he should nt speak against felix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix is good charlotte answered softly but promptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand is much nearer to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should never think of going to felix with a troublewith a question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand is much more to us gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is veryvery good gertrude repeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is more to you yes much more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charlotte she added suddenly you are in love with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried poor charlotte and her sister saw her blushing in the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gertrude put her arm round her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish he would marry you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must not say such things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you like him more than you say and he likes you more than he knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is very cruel of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if it was cruel gertrude continued pitiless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not if it s true she answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish he would marry you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean to tell him so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes if he speaks to me again about myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will say why dont you marry charlotte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she s a thousand times better than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are wicked you are changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont like it you can prevent it said gertrude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can prevent it by keeping him from speaking to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with this she walked away very conscious of what she had done measuring it and finding a certain joy and a quickened sense of freedom in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be my only hope perhaps but better than despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after all it was a beautiful and curious world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but probably the machine had only been taken away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still i must be calm and patient find its hidingplace and recover it by force or cunning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with that i scrambled to my feet and looked about me wondering where i could bathe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt weary stiff and travelsoiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed as i went about my business i found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wasted some time in futile questionings conveyed as well as i was able to such of the little people as came by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all failed to understand my gestures some were simply stolid some thought it was a jest and laughed at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a foolish impulse but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found a groove ripped in it about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where on arrival i had struggled with the overturned machine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were other signs of removal about with queer narrow footprints like those i could imagine made by a sloth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this directed my closer attention to the pedestal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as i think i have said of bronze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not a mere block but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went and rapped at these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> examining the panels with care i found them discontinuous with the frames <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no handles or keyholes but possibly the panels if they were doors as i supposed opened from within <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing was clear enough to my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took no very great mental effort to infer that my time machine was inside that pedestal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how it got there was a different problem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw the heads of two orangeclad people coming through the bushes and under some blossomcovered appletrees towards me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned smiling to them and beckoned them to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came and then pointing to the bronze pedestal i tried to intimate my wish to open it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how to convey their expression to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicateminded womanit is how she would look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went off as if they had received the last possible insult <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried a sweetlooking little chap in white next with exactly the same result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow his manner made me feel ashamed of myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as you know i wanted the time machine and i tried him once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he turned off like the others my temper got the better of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in three strides i was after him had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck and began dragging him towards the sphinx <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i saw the horror and repugnance of his face and all of a sudden i let him go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was not beaten yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i banged with my fist at the bronze panels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i heard something stir insideto be explicit i thought i heard a sound like a chucklebut i must have been mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i got a big pebble from the river and came and hammered till i had flattened a coil in the decorations and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand but nothing came of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw a crowd of them upon the slopes looking furtively at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last hot and tired i sat down to watch the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was too restless to watch long i am too occidental for a long vigil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could work at a problem for years but to wait inactive for twentyfour hoursthat is another matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got up after a time and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the hill again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they mean to take your machine away its little good your wrecking their bronze panels and if they dont you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> learn its ways watch it be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the end you will find clues to it all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind the thought of the years i had spent in study and toil to get into the future age and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although it was at my own expense i could not help myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> going through the big palace it seemed to me that the little people avoided me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may have been my fancy or it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet i felt tolerably sure of the avoidance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was careful however to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made what progress i could in the language and in addition i pushed my explorations here and there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either i missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simplealmost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there seemed to be few if any abstract terms or little use of figurative language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their sentences were usually simple and of two words and i failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i determined to put the thought of my time machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet a certain feeling you may understand tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far as i could see all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the thames valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from every hill i climbed i saw the same abundance of splendid buildings endlessly varied in material and style the same clustering thickets of evergreens the same blossomladen trees and treeferns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there water shone like silver and beyond the land rose into blue undulating hills and so faded into the serenity of the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a peculiar feature which presently attracted my attention was the presence of certain circular wells several as it seemed to me of a very great depth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one lay by the path up the hill which i had followed during my first walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the others it was rimmed with bronze curiously wrought and protected by a little cupola from the rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sitting by the side of these wells and peering down into the shafted darkness i could see no gleam of water nor could i start any reflection with a lighted match <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in all of them i heard a certain sound a thudthudthud like the beating of some big engine and i discovered from the flaring of my matches that a steady current of air set down the shafts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> further i threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one and instead of fluttering slowly down it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a time too i came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and there upon the slopes for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sunscorched beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> putting things together i reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation whose true import it was difficult to imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an obvious conclusion but it was absolutely wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here i must admit that i learned very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance and the like conveniences during my time in this real future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in some of these visions of utopias and coming times which i have read there is a vast amount of detail about building and social arrangements and so forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in ones imagination they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as i found here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conceive the tale of london which a negro fresh from central africa would take back to his tribe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would he know of railway companies of social movements of telephone and telegraph wires of the parcels delivery company and postal orders and the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet we at least should be willing enough to explain these things to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and even of what he knew how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times and how wide the interval between myself and these of the golden age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sensible of much which was unseen and which contributed to my comfort but save for a general impression of automatic organization i fear i can convey very little of the difference to your mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the matter of sepulchre for instance i could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it occurred to me that possibly there might be cemeteries or crematoria somewhere beyond the range of my explorings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this again was a question i deliberately put to myself and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing puzzled me and i was led to make a further remark which puzzled me still more that aged and infirm among this people there were none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet i could think of no other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the several big palaces i had explored were mere living places great dininghalls and sleeping apartments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could find no machinery no appliances of any kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal and their sandals though undecorated were fairly complex specimens of metalwork <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow such things must be made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no shops no workshops no sign of importations among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they spent all their time in playing gently in bathing in the river in making love in a halfplayful fashion in eating fruit and sleeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not see how things were kept going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then again about the time machine something i knew not what had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the white sphinx <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the life of me i could not imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those waterless wells too those flickering pillars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt i lacked a clue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felthow shall i put it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose you found an inscription with sentences here and there in excellent plain english and interpolated therewith others made up of words of letters even absolutely unknown to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well on the third day of my visit that was how the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one presented itself to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that day too i made a friendof a sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened that as i was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the main current ran rather swiftly but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will give you an idea therefore of the strange deficiency in these creatures when i tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i realized this i hurriedly slipped off my clothes and wading in at a point lower down i caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round and i had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before i left her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had got to such a low estimate of her kind that i did not expect any gratitude from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that however i was wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the afternoon i met my little woman as i believe it was as i was returning towards my centre from an exploration and she received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers evidently made for me and me alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very possibly i had been feeling desolate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate i did my best to display my appreciation of the gift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were soon seated together in a little stone arbour engaged in conversation chiefly of smiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the creatures friendliness affected me exactly as a childs might have done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we passed each other flowers and she kissed my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did the same to hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i tried talk and found that her name was weena which though i dont know what it meant somehow seemed appropriate enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week and endedas i will tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was exactly like a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wanted to be with me always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tried to follow me everywhere and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down and leave her at last exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the problems of the world had to be mastered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not i said to myself come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet her distress when i left her was very great her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic and i think altogether i had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless she was somehow a very great comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until it was too late i did not clearly know what i had inflicted upon her when i left her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor until it was too late did i clearly understand what she was to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for by merely seeming fond of me and showing in her weak futile way that she cared for me the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the white sphinx almost the feeling of coming home and i would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as i came over the hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was from her too that i learned that fear had not yet left the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was fearless enough in the daylight and she had the oddest confidence in me for once in a foolish moment i made threatening grimaces at her and she simply laughed at them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she dreaded the dark dreaded shadows dreaded black things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darkness to her was the one thing dreadful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a singularly passionate emotion and it set me thinking and observing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i discovered then among other things that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark and slept in droves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never found one out of doors or one sleeping alone within doors after dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet i was still such a blockhead that i missed the lesson of that fear and in spite of weenas distress i insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it troubled her greatly but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed and for five of the nights of our acquaintance including the last night of all she slept with her head pillowed on my arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my story slips away from me as i speak of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must have been the night before her rescue that i was awakened about dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been restless dreaming most disagreeably that i was drowned and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i woke with a start and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried to get to sleep again but i felt restless and uncomfortable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness when everything is colourless and clear cut and yet unreal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got up and went down into the great hall and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i would make a virtue of necessity and see the sunrise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon was setting and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly halflight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bushes were inky black the ground a sombre grey the sky colourless and cheerless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and up the hill i thought i could see ghosts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there several times as i scanned the slope i saw white figures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice i fancied i saw a solitary white apelike creature running rather quickly up the hill and once near the ruins i saw a leash of them carrying some dark body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not see what became of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed that they vanished among the bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dawn was still indistinct you must understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was feeling that chill uncertain earlymorning feeling you may have known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the eastern sky grew brighter and the light of the day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more i scanned the view keenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i saw no vestige of my white figures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were mere creatures of the half light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they must have been ghosts i said i wonder whence they dated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a queer notion of grant allens came into my head and amused me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if each generation die and leave ghosts he argued the world at last will get overcrowded with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on that theory they would have grown innumerable some eight hundred thousand years hence and it was no great wonder to see four at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the jest was unsatisfying and i was thinking of these figures all the morning until weenas rescue drove them out of my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal i had startled in my first passionate search for the time machine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but weena was a pleasant substitute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet all the same they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this golden age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be that the sun was hotter or the earth nearer the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but people unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger darwin forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as these catastrophes occur the sun will blaze with renewed energy and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever the reason the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well one very hot morningmy fourth i thinkas i was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where i slept and fed there happened this strange thing clambering among these heaps of masonry i found a narrow gallery whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by contrast with the brilliancy outside it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i entered it groping for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pair of eyes luminous by reflection against the daylight without was watching me out of the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i remembered that strange terror of the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> overcoming my fear to some extent i advanced a step and spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will admit that my voice was harsh and illcontrolled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put out my hand and touched something soft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once the eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned with my heart in my mouth and saw a queer little apelike figure its head held down in a peculiar manner running across the sunlit space behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it blundered against a block of granite staggered aside and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my impression of it is of course imperfect but i know it was a dull white and had strange large greyishred eyes also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as i say it went too fast for me to see distinctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot even say whether it ran on allfours or only with its forearms held very low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after an instants pause i followed it into the second heap of ruins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not find it at first but after a time in the profound obscurity i came upon one of those round welllike openings of which i have told you half closed by a fallen pillar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sudden thought came to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could this thing have vanished down the shaft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lit a match and looking down i saw a small white moving creature with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so like a human spider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was clambering down the wall and now i saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand going out as it dropped and when i had lit another the little monster had disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know how long i sat peering down that well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not for some time that i could succeed in persuading myself that the thing i had seen was human <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but gradually the truth dawned on me that man had not remained one species but had differentiated into two distinct animals that my graceful children of the upperworld were not the sole descendants of our generation but that this bleached obscene nocturnal thing which had flashed before me was also heir to all the ages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to suspect their true import <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what i wondered was this lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organization <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful upperworlders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what was hidden down there at the foot of that shaft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that at any rate there was nothing to fear and that there i must descend for the solution of my difficulties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and withal i was absolutely afraid to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i hesitated two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the male pursued the female flinging flowers at her as he ran <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed distressed to find me my arm against the overturned pillar peering down the well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures for when i pointed to this one and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue they were still more visibly distressed and turned away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they were interested by my matches and i struck some to amuse them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried them again about the well and again i failed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so presently i left them meaning to go back to weena and see what i could get from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my mind was already in revolution my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had now a clue to the import of these wells to the ventilating towers to the mystery of the ghosts to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the time machine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plainly this second species of man was subterranean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a longcontinued underground habit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the darkthe white fish of the kentucky caves for instance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then those large eyes with that capacity for reflecting light are common features of nocturnal things witness the owl and the cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and last of all that evident confusion in the sunshine that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the lightall reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath my feet then the earth must be tunnelled enormously and these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopeseverywhere in fact except along the river valley showed how universal were its ramifications <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what so natural then as to assume that it was in this artificial underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the notion was so plausible that i at once accepted it and went on to assume the how of this splitting of the human species <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory though for myself i very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first proceeding from the problems of our own age it seemed clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the capitalist and the labourer was the key to the whole position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt it will seem grotesque enough to youand wildly incredible!and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilization there is the metropolitan railway in london for instance there are new electric railways there are subways there are underground workrooms and restaurants and they increase and multiply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently i thought this tendency had increased till industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories spending a stillincreasing amount of its time therein till in the end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even now does not an eastend worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again the exclusive tendency of richer peopledue no doubt to the increasing refinement of their education and the widening gulf between them and the rude violence of the poor is already leading to the closing in their interest of considerable portions of the surface of the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about london for instance perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this same widening gulfwhich is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the richwill make that exchange between class and class that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification less and less frequent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so in the end above ground you must have the haves pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty and below ground the havenots the workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once they were there they would no doubt have to pay rent and not a little of it for the ventilation of their caverns and if they refused they would starve or be suffocated for arrears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die and in the end the balance being permanent the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life and as happy in their way as the upperworld people were to theirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it seemed to me the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great triumph of humanity i had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been no such triumph of moral education and general cooperation as i had imagined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead i saw a real aristocracy armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its triumph had not been simply a triumph over nature but a triumph over nature and the fellowman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this i must warn you was my theory at the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the utopian books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my explanation may be absolutely wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i still think it is the most plausible one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but even on this supposition the balanced civilization that was at last attained must have long since passed its zenith and was now far fallen into decay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tooperfect security of the upperworlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration to a general dwindling in size strength and intelligence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i could see clearly enough already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what had happened to the undergrounders i did not yet suspect but from what i had seen of the morlocksthat by the by was the name by which these creatures were calledi could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the eloi the beautiful race that i already knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why had the morlocks taken my time machine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i felt sure it was they who had taken it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why too if the eloi were masters could they not restore the machine to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and why were they so terribly afraid of the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i proceeded as i have said to question weena about this underworld but here again i was disappointed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first she would not understand my questions and presently she refused to answer them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shivered as though the topic was unendurable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when i pressed her perhaps a little harshly she burst into tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were the only tears except my own i ever saw in that golden age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i saw them i ceased abruptly to trouble about the morlocks and was only concerned in banishing these signs of the human inheritance from weenas eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands while i solemnly burned a match <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may seem odd to you but it was two days before i could follow up the newfound clue in what was manifestly the proper way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were just the halfbleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they were filthily cold to the touch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the eloi whose disgust of the morlocks i now began to appreciate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next night i did not sleep well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> probably my health was a little disordered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was oppressed with perplexity and doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once or twice i had a feeling of intense fear for which i could perceive no definite reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlightthat night weena was among themand feeling reassured by their presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it occurred to me even then that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter and the nights grow dark when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below these whitened lemurs this new vermin that had replaced the old might be more abundant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and on both these days i had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt assured that the time machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these underground mysteries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet i could not face the mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if only i had had a companion it would have been different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was so horribly alone and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know if you will understand my feeling but i never felt quite safe at my back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was this restlessness this insecurity perhaps that drove me further and further afield in my exploring expeditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> going to the southwestward towards the rising country that is now called combe wood i observed far off in the direction of nineteenthcentury banstead a vast green structure different in character from any i had hitherto seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins i knew and the facade had an oriental look the face of it having the lustre as well as the palegreen tint a kind of bluishgreen of a certain type of chinese porcelain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this difference in aspect suggested a difference in use and i was minded to push on and explore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the day was growing late and i had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit so i resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day and i returned to the welcome and the caresses of little weena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but next morning i perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the palace of green porcelain was a piece of selfdeception to enable me to shirk by another day an experience i dreaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i resolved i would make the descent without further waste of time and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she danced beside me to the well but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward she seemed strangely disconcerted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodbye little weena i said kissing her and then putting her down i began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rather hastily i may as well confess for i feared my courage might leak away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first she watched me in amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she gave a most piteous cry and running to me she began to pull at me with her little hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shook her off perhaps a little roughly and in another moment i was in the throat of the well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw her agonized face over the parapet and smiled to reassure her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i had to look down at the unstable hooks to which i clung <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself i was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the bars bent suddenly under my weight and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment i hung by one hand and after that experience i did not dare to rest again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though my arms and back were presently acutely painful i went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glancing upward i saw the aperture a small blue disk in which a star was visible while little weenas head showed as a round black projection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark and when i looked up again weena had disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was in an agony of discomfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again and leave the underworld alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but even while i turned this over in my mind i continued to descend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last with intense relief i saw dimly coming up a foot to the right of me a slender loophole in the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> swinging myself in i found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which i could lie down and rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my arms ached my back was cramped and i was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides this the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know how long i lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was roused by a soft hand touching my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> starting up in the darkness i snatched at my matches and hastily striking one i saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one i had seen above ground in the ruin hastily retreating before the light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> living as they did in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes and they reflected the light in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but so soon as i struck a match in order to see them they fled incontinently vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried to call to them but the language they had was apparently different from that of the overworld people so that i was needs left to my own unaided efforts and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i said to myself you are in for it now and feeling my way along the tunnel i found the noise of machinery grow louder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the walls fell away from me and i came to a large open space and striking another match saw that i had entered a vast arched cavern which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the view i had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness and cast grotesque black shadows in which dim spectral morlocks sheltered from the glare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place by the by was very stuffy and oppressive and the faint halitus of freshly shed blood was in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal laid with what seemed a meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morlocks at any rate were carnivorous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even at the time i remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint i saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all very indistinct the heavy smell the big unmeaning shapes the obscene figures lurking in the shadows and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the match burned down and stung my fingers and fell a wriggling red spot in the blackness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have thought since how particularly illequipped i was for such an experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i had started with the time machine i had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had come without arms without medicine without anything to smokeat times i missed tobacco frightfullyeven without enough matches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if only i had thought of a kodak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could have flashed that glimpse of the underworld in a second and examined it at leisure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as it was i stood there with only the weapons and the powers that nature had endowed me withhands feet and teeth these and four safetymatches that still remained to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark and it was only with my last glimpse of light i discovered that my store of matches had run low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economize them and i had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the upperworlders to whom fire was a novelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you were cutting it hot i suppose and going to catch all the gravy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll be long before i promise you such a thing again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leave the room sir and have the kindness to wait in the coal cellar till i call you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gluck left the room melancholy enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brothers ate as much mutton as they could locked the rest in the cupboard and proceeded to get very drunk after dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a night as it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howling wind and rushing rain without intermission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brothers had just sense enough left to put up all the shutters and doublebar the door before they went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they usually slept in the same room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the clock struck twelve they were both awakened by a tremendous crash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their door burst open with a violence that shook the house from top to bottom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried schwartz starting up in his bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only i said the little gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two brothers sat up on their bolster and stared into the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room was full of water and by a misty moonbeam which found its way through a hole in the shutter they could see in the midst of it an enormous foam globe spinning round and bobbing up and down like a cork on which as on a most luxurious cushion reclined the little old gentleman cap and all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was plenty of room for it now for the roof was off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sorry to incommode you said their visitor ironically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid your beds are dampish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps you had better go to your brothers room ive left the ceiling on there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they required no second admonition but rushed into glucks room wet through and in an agony of terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll find my card on the kitchen table the old gentleman called after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dawn came at last and the two brothers looked out of glucks little window in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the treasure valley was one mass of ruin and desolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inundation had swept away trees crops and cattle and left in their stead a waste of red sand and gray mud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two brothers crept shivering and horrorstruck into the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water had gutted the whole first floor corn money almost every movable thing had been swept away and there was left only a small white card on the kitchen table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on it in large of the proceedings of the three brothers after the visit of southwest wind esquire and how little gluck had an interview southwest wind esquire was as good as his word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the momentous visit above related he entered the treasure valley no more and what was worse he had so much influence with his relations the west winds in general and used it so effectually that they all adopted a similar line of conduct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so no rain fell in the valley from one years end to another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though everything remained green and flourishing in the plains below the inheritance of the three brothers was a desert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what had once been the richest soil in the kingdom became a shifting heap of red sand and the brothers unable longer to contend with the adverse skies abandoned their valueless patrimony in despair to seek some means of gaining a livelihood among the cities and people of the plains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all their money was gone and they had nothing left but some curious old fashioned pieces of gold plate the last remnants of their ill gotten wealth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose we turn goldsmiths said schwartz to hans as they entered the large city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a good knaves trade we can put a great deal of copper into the gold without anyones finding it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought was agreed to be a very good one they hired a furnace and turned goldsmiths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but two slight circumstances affected their trade the first that people did not approve of the coppered gold the second that the two elder brothers whenever they had sold anything used to leave little gluck to mind the furnace and go and drink out the money in the alehouse next door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they melted all their gold without making money enough to buy more and were at last reduced to one large drinking mug which an uncle of his had given to little gluck and which he was very fond of and would not have parted with for the world though he never drank anything out of it but milk and water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mug was a very odd mug to look at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the handle was formed of two wreaths of flowing golden hair so finely spun that it looked more like silk than metal and these wreaths descended into and mixed with a beard and whiskers of the same exquisite workmanship which surrounded and decorated a very fierce little face of the reddest gold imaginable right in the front of the mug with a pair of eyes in it which seemed to command its whole circumference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was impossible to drink out of the mug without being subjected to an intense gaze out of the side of these eyes and schwartz positively averred that once after emptying it full of rhenish seventeen times he had seen them wink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it came to the mugs turn to be made into spoons it half broke poor little glucks heart but the brothers only laughed at him tossed the mug into the melting pot and staggered out to the alehouse leaving him as usual to pour the gold into bars when it was all ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were gone gluck took a farewell look at his old friend in the melting pot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the flowing hair was all gone nothing remained but the red nose and the sparkling eyes which looked more malicious than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and no wonder thought gluck after being treated in that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sauntered disconsolately to the window and sat himself down to catch the fresh evening air and escape the hot breath of the furnace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this window commanded a direct view of the range of mountains which as i told you before overhung the treasure valley and more especially of the peak from which fell the golden river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was just at the close of the day and when gluck sat down at the window he saw the rocks of the mountain tops all crimson and purple with the sunset and there were bright tongues of fiery cloud burning and quivering about them and the river brighter than all fell in a waving column of pure gold from precipice to precipice with the double arch of a broad purple rainbow stretched across it flushing and fading alternately in the wreaths of spray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said gluck aloud after he had looked at it for a little while if that river were really all gold what a nice thing it would be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no it wouldnt gluck said a clear metallic voice close at his ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked round the room and under the table and a great many times behind him but there was certainly nobody there and he sat down again at the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time he didnt speak but he couldnt help thinking again that it would be very convenient if the river were really all gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not at all my boy said the same voice louder than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said gluck again what is that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked again into all the corners and cupboards and then began turning round and round as fast as he could in the middle of the room thinking there was somebody behind him when the same voice struck again on his ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was singing now very merrily lalalira lano words only a soft running effervescent melody something like that of a kettle on the boil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gluck looked out of the window no it was certainly in the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upstairs and downstairs no it was certainly in that very room coming in quicker time and clearer notes every moment lalalirala <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all at once it struck gluck that it sounded louder near the furnace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ran to the opening and looked in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he saw right it seemed to be coming not only out of the furnace but out of the pot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he uncovered it and ran back in a great fright for the pot was certainly singing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood in the farthest corner of the room with his hands up and his mouth open for a minute or two when the singing stopped and the voice became clear and pronunciative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gluck my boy said the pot again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gluck summoned all his energies walked straight up to the crucible drew it out of the furnace and looked in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gold was all melted and its surface as smooth and polished as a river but instead of reflecting little glucks head as he looked in he saw meeting his glance from beneath the gold the red nose and sharp eyes of his old friend of the mug a thousand times redder and sharper than ever he had seen them in his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come gluck my boy said the voice out of the pot again im all right pour me out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but gluck was too much astonished to do anything of the kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pour me out i say said the voice rather gruffly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by a violent effort gluck recovered the use of his limbs took hold of the crucible and sloped it so as to pour out the gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but instead of a liquid stream there came out first a pair of pretty little yellow legs then some coat tails then a pair of arms stuck akimbo and finally the wellknown head of his friend the mugall which articles uniting as they rolled out stood up energetically on the floor in the shape of a little golden dwarf about a foot and a half high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the dwarf stretching out first his legs and then his arms and then shaking his head up and down and as far round as it would go for five minutes without stopping apparently with the view of ascertaining if he were quite correctly put together while gluck stood contemplating him in speechless amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was dressed in a slashed doublet of spun gold so fine in its texture that the prismatic colors gleamed over it as if on a surface of motherofpearl and over this brilliant doublet his hair and beard fell full halfway to the ground in waving curls so exquisitely delicate that gluck could hardly tell where they ended they seemed to melt into air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the features of the face however were by no means finished with the same delicacy they were rather coarse slightly inclining to coppery in complexion and indicative in expression of a very pertinacious and intractable disposition in their small proprietor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the dwarf had finished his self examination he turned his small sharp eyes full on gluck and stared at him deliberately for a minute or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no it wouldnt gluck my boy said the little man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was certainly rather an abrupt and unconnected mode of commencing conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might indeed be supposed to refer to the course of glucks thoughts which had first produced the dwarfs observations out of the pot but whatever it referred to gluck had no inclination to dispute the dictum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said gluck very mildly and submissively indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said the dwarf conclusively no it wouldnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with that the dwarf pulled his cap hard over his brows and took two turns of three feet long up and down the room lifting his legs up very high and setting them down very hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the carpet was new and the litter of alexanders clothes and books and drawing materials and a pencildrawing on the wall which in johns eyes appeared a marvel of proficiency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was thus lying and looking and dreaming hanging as it were between two epochs of his life when alexander came to the door and made his presence known in a loud whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john let him in and jumped back into the warm bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well john said alexander the cablegram is sent in your name and twenty words of answer paid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been to the cab office and paid your cab even saw the old gentleman himself and properly apologised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was mighty placable and indicated his belief you had been drinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i knocked up old macewen out of bed and explained affairs to him as he sat and shivered in a dressinggown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and before that i had been to the high street where they have heard nothing of your dead body so that i incline to the idea that catch me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well the police never do know anything assented alexander and at any rate they have despatched a man to inquire and to recover your trousers and your money so that really your bill is now fairly clean and i see but one lion ill be turned out again youll see said john dismally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont imagine so returned the other not if you do what flora and i have arranged and your business now is to dress and lose no time about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you have a quarter of an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by five minutes before the half hour you must be at table in your old seat under uncle duthies picture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flora will be there to keep you wouldnt it be wiser for me to stay in bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you mean to manage your own concerns you can do precisely what you like replied alexander but if you are not in your place five minutes before the halfhour i wash my and thereupon he departed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had spoken warmly but the truth is his heart was somewhat troubled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as he hung over the balusters watching for his father to appear he had hard ado to keep himself braced for the encounter that must follow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he takes it well i shall be lucky he reflected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he takes it ill why itll be a herring across johns tracks and perhaps all for the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a confounded at that stage a door opened below with a certain emphasis and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholson was seen solemnly to descend the stairs and pass into his own apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexander followed quaking inwardly but with a steady face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knocked was bidden to enter and found his father standing in front of the forced drawer to which he pointed as he spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a most extraordinary thing said he i have been i was afraid you would notice it observed his son it you were afraid i would notice it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i was a thief sir returned alexander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took all the money in case the servants should get hold of it and here is the change and a note of my expenditure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were gone to bed you see and i did not feel at liberty to knock you up but i think when you have heard the circumstances you will do me justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact is i have reason to believe there has been some dreadful error about my brother john the sooner it can be cleared up the better for all parties it was a piece of business sir and so i took it and decided on my own responsibility to send a telegram to san francisco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thanks to my quickness we may hear tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there appears to be no doubt sir that john has been when did this take place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last night sir after you were asleep was the reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean all night as you say sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been to the telegraph and the police office and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i had my hands full said alexander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think of no one but i do not see that i have much to gain in bringing back my elder brother returned alexander shrewdly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answer pleased the old man he smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well well i will go into this after breakfast said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sorry about the table said the son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the table is a small matter i think nothing of that said the father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its another example continued the son of the awkwardness of a man having no money of his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had a proper allowance like other fellows of my age this would a proper allowance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeated his father in tones of blighting sarcasm for the expression was not new to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i no doubt no doubt said alexander but then you see you arent always on the spot to have the thing explained to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you could have wakened me last night interrupted his father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it not some similar affair that first got john into a mess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the son skilfully evading the point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the father was not less adroit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and pray sir how did you come and go out of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forgot to lock the door it seems replied alexander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have had cause to complain of that too often said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still i do not understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you keep the i propose to go into all that at length after breakfast returned alexander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is the halfhour going we must and greatly daring he opened the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even alexander who it must have been perceived was on terms of comparative freedom with his parent even alexander had never before dared to cut short an interview in this high handed fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the truth is the very mass of his sons delinquencies daunted the old gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was like the man with the cart of apples this was beyond him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that alexander should have spoiled his table taken his money stayed out all night and then coolly acknowledged all was something undreamed of in the nicholsonian philosophy and transcended comment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the return of the change which the old gentleman still carried in his hand had been a feature of imposing impudence it had dealt him a staggering blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was the reference to johns original flight a subject which he always kept resolutely curtained in his own mind for he was a man who loved to have made no mistakes and when he feared he might have made one kept the papers sealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in view of all these surprises and reminders and of his sons composed and masterful demeanour there began to creep on mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed beyond his depth if he did or said anything he might come to regret it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man besides as he had pointed out himself was playing a generous part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if wrong had been done and done to one who was after and in spite of all a nicholson it should certainly be righted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all things considered monstrous as it was to be cut short in his inquiries the old gentleman submitted pocketed the change and followed his son into the diningroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during these few steps he once more mentally revolted and once more and this time finally laid down his arms a still small voice in his bosom having informed him authentically of a piece of news that he was afraid of alexander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strange thing was that he was pleased to be afraid of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was proud of his son he might be proud of him the boy had character and grit and knew what he was doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were his reflections as he turned the corner of the diningroom door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss mackenzie was in the place of honour conjuring with a teapot and a cosy and behold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was another person present a large portly whiskered man of a very comfortable and respectable air who now rose from his seat and came forward holding out his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the contention of feeling that ran high in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholsons starched bosom no outward sign was visible nor did he delay long to make a choice of conduct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet in that interval he had reviewed a great field of possibilities both past and future whether it was possible he had not been perfectly wise in his treatment of john whether it was possible that john was innocent whether if he turned john out a second time as his outraged authority suggested it was possible to avoid a scandal and whether if he went to that extremity it was possible that alexander might rebel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholson and put his hand limp and dead into johns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then in an embarrassed silence all took their places and even the paper from which it was the old gentlemans habit to suck mortification daily as he marked the decline of our institutions even the paper lay furled by his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but presently flora came to the rescue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she slid into the silence with a technicality asking if john still took his old inordinate amount of sugar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thence it was but a step to the burning question of the day and in tones a little shaken she commented on the interval since she had last made tea for the prodigal and congratulated him on his return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholson she congratulated him also in a manner that defied his illhumour and from that launched into the tale of johns misadventures not without some suitable suppressions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gradually alexander joined between them whether he would or no they forced a word or two from john and these fell so tremulously and spoke so eloquently of a mind oppressed with dread that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length even he contributed a question and before the meal was at an end all four were talking even freely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prayers followed with the servants gaping at this newcomer whom no one had admitted and after prayers there came that moment on the clock which was the signal for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john said he of course you will stay here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be very careful not to excite maria if miss mackenzie thinks it desirable that you should see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexander i wish to speak with you alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then when they were both in the back room you need not come to the office today said he you can stay and amuse your brother and i think it would be respectful to call on uncle greig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by the bye this spoken with a certain dare we say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bashfulness i agree to concede the principle of an allowance and i will consult with doctor durie who is quite a man of the world and has sons of his own as to the amount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and my fine fellow you may consider yourself in luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before noon a detective had restored to john his money and brought news sad enough in truth but perhaps the least sad possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alan had been found in his own house in regent terrace under care of the terrified butler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was quite mad and instead of going to prison had gone to morningside asylum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the murdered man it appeared was an evicted tenant who had for nearly a year pursued his late landlord with threats and insults and beyond this the cause and details of the tragedy were lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholson returned from dinner they were able to put a despatch into his hands john v <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kirkham has disappeared police looking for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having had this explained to him the old gentleman took down the cellar key and departed for two bottles of the port <end> <end> 
<start> <start> uncle greig dined there that day and cousin robina and by an odd chance mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macewen and the presence of these strangers relieved what might have been otherwise a somewhat strained relation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ere they departed the family was welded once more into a fair semblance of unity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the end of april john led flora or as more descriptive flora led john to the altar if altar that may be called which was indeed the drawingroom mantelpiece in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholsons house with the reverend dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> durie posted on the hearthrug in the guise of hymens priest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last i saw of them on a recent visit to the north was at a dinnerparty in the house of my old friend gellatly macbride and after we had in classic phrase rejoined the ladies i had an opportunity to overhear flora conversing with another married woman on the much canvassed matter of a husbands tobacco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said she i only allow mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three he smokes at fixed times after a meal you know my dear and the fourth he can take when he likes with bravo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thought i to myself this is the wife for my friend every night in the year four of us sat in the small parlour of the george at debenham the undertaker and the landlord and fettes and myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes there would be more but blow high blow low come rain or snow or frost we four would be each planted in his own particular armchair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes was an old drunken scotchman a man of education obviously and a man of some property since he lived in idleness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had come to debenham years ago while still young and by a mere continuance of living had grown to be an adopted townsman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his blue camlet cloak was a local antiquity like the churchspire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his place in the parlour at the george his absence from church his old crapulous disreputable vices were all things of course in debenham <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had some vague radical opinions and some fleeting infidelities which he would now and again set forth and emphasise with tottering slaps upon the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drank rum five glasses regularly every evening and for the greater portion of his nightly visit to the george sat with his glass in his right hand in a state of melancholy alcoholic saturation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we called him the doctor for he was supposed to have some special knowledge of medicine and had been known upon a pinch to set a fracture or reduce a dislocation but beyond these slight particulars we had no knowledge of his character and antecedents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one dark winter night it had struck nine some time before the landlord joined us there was a sick man in the george a great neighbouring proprietor suddenly struck down with apoplexy on his way to parliament and the great mans still greater london doctor had been telegraphed to his bedside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time that such a thing had happened in debenham for the railway was but newly open and we were all proportionately moved by the occurrence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes come said the landlord after he had filled and lighted his pipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes was far through his third tumbler stupidly fuddled now nodding over now staring mazily around him but at the last word he seemed to awaken and repeated the name macfarlane twice quietly enough the first time but with sudden emotion at the second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the landlord thats his name doctor wolfe fettes became instantly sober his eyes awoke his voice became clear loud and steady his language forcible and earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were all startled by the transformation as if a man had risen from the dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg your pardon he said i am afraid i have not been paying much attention to your talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then when he had heard the landlord out it cannot be it cannot be he added and yet i would like do you know him doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the undertaker with a gasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet the name is a strange one it were too much to fancy two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me landlord is he well said the host hes not a young man to be sure and he is older though years older <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but with a slap upon the table its the rum you see in my face rum and sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this man perhaps may have an easy conscience and a good digestion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would think i was some good old decent christian would you not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no not i i never canted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> voltaire might have canted if hed stood in my shoes but the brains with a rattling fillip on his bald head the brains were clear and active and i if you know this doctor i ventured to remark after a somewhat awful pause i should gather that you do not share fettes paid no regard to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he said with sudden decision i must see him face to there was another pause and then a door was closed rather sharply on the first floor and a step was heard upon the stair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the doctor cried the landlord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look sharp and it was but two steps from the small parlour to the door of the old george inn the wide oak staircase landed almost in the street there was room for a turkey rug and nothing more between the threshold and the last round of the descent but this little space was every evening brilliantly lit up not only by the light upon the stair and the great signallamp below the sign but by the warm radiance of the barroom window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the george thus brightly advertised itself to passersby in the cold street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes walked steadily to the spot and we who were hanging behind beheld the two men meet as one of them had phrased it face to face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his white hair set off his pale and placid although energetic countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was richly dressed in the finest of broadcloth and the whitest of linen with a great gold watchchain and studs and spectacles of the same precious material <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore a broad folded tie white and speckled with lilac and he carried on his arm a comfortable drivingcoat of fur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no doubt but he became his years breathing as he did of wealth and consideration and it was a surprising contrast to see our parlour sot bald dirty pimpled and robed in his old camlet cloak confront him at the bottom of the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said somewhat loudly more like a herald than a friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great doctor pulled up short on the fourth step as though the familiarity of the address surprised and somewhat shocked his dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stared for the swiftest of seconds at the man before him glanced behind him with a sort of scare and then in a startled whisper fettes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ay said the other me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you think i was dead too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this meeting is so unexpected i can see you are unmanned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hardly knew you i confess at first but i am overjoyed overjoyed to have this opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the present it must be howdyedo and goodbye in one for my fly is waiting and i must not fail the train but you shall let me see yes you shall give me your address and you can count on early news of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must do something for you fettes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fear you are out at elbows but we must see to that for auld money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the money that i had dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macfarlane had talked himself into some measure of superiority and confidence but the uncommon energy of this refusal cast him back into his first confusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a horrible ugly look came and went across his almost venerable countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear fellow he said be it as you please my last thought is to offend you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would i do not wish it i do not wish to know the roof that shelters you interrupted the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard your name i feared it might be you i wished to know if after all there he still stood in the middle of the rug between the stair and doorway and the great london physician in order to escape would be forced to step to one side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was plain that he hesitated before the thought of this humiliation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> white as he was there was a dangerous glitter in his spectacles but while he still paused uncertain he became aware that the driver of his fly was peering in from the street at this unusual scene and caught a glimpse at the same time of our little body from the parlour huddled by the corner of the bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the presence of so many witnesses decided him at once to flee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he crouched together brushing on the wainscot and made a dart like a serpent striking for the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his tribulation was not yet entirely at an end for even as he was passing fettes clutched him by the arm and these words came in a whisper and yet painfully distinct the great rich london doctor cried out aloud with a sharp throttling cry he dashed his questioner across the open space and with his hands over his head fled out of the door like a detected thief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before it had occurred to one of us to make a movement the fly was already rattling toward the station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scene was over like a dream but the dream had left proofs and traces of its passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next day the servant found the fine gold spectacles broken on the threshold and that very night we were all standing breathless by the bar room window and fettes at our side sober pale and resolute in look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the landlord coming first into possession of his customary senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what in the universe is all this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are strange things you have been fettes turned toward us he looked us each in succession in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see if you can hold your tongues said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that man macfarlane is not safe to cross those that have and then without so much as finishing his third glass far less waiting for the other two he bade us goodbye and went forth under the lamp of the hotel into the black night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we three turned to our places in the parlour with the big red fire and four clear candles and as we recapitulated what had passed the first chill of our surprise soon changed into a glow of curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we sat late it was the latest session i have known in the old george <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each man before we parted had his theory that he was bound to prove and none of us had any nearer business in this world than to track out the past of our condemned companion and surprise the secret that he shared with the great london doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is no great boast but i believe i was a better hand at worming out a story than either of my fellows at the george and perhaps there is now no other man alive who could narrate to you the following foul and unnatural events <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his young days fettes studied medicine in the schools of edinburgh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had talent of a kind the talent that picks up swiftly what it hears and readily retails it for its own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he worked little at home but he was civil attentive and intelligent in the presence of his masters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they soon picked him out as a lad who listened closely and remembered well nay strange as it seemed to me when i first heard it he was in those days well favoured and pleased by his exterior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was at that period a certain extramural teacher of anatomy whom i shall here designate by the letter k <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his name was subsequently too well known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man who bore it skulked through the streets of edinburgh in disguise while the mob that applauded at the execution of burke called loudly for the blood of his employer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> k was then at the top of his vogue he enjoyed a popularity due partly to his own talent and address partly to the incapacity of his rival the university professor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the students at least swore by his name and fettes believed himself and was believed by others to have laid the foundations of success when he had acquired the favour of this meteorically famous man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> k was a bon vivant as well as an accomplished teacher he liked a sly illusion no less than a careful preparation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in both capacities fettes enjoyed and deserved his notice and by the second year of his attendance he held the halfregular position of second demonstrator or sub assistant in his class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this capacity the charge of the theatre and lectureroom devolved in particular upon his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had to answer for the cleanliness of the premises and the conduct of the other students and it was a part of his duty to supply receive and divide the various subjects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with a view to this last at that time very delicate affair that he was lodged by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> k in the same wynd and at last in the same building with the dissectingrooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here after a night of turbulent pleasures his hand still tottering his sight still misty and confused he would be called out of bed in the black hours before the winter dawn by the unclean and desperate interlopers who supplied the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would open the door to these men since infamous throughout the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would help them with their tragic burden pay them their sordid price and remain alone when they were gone with the unfriendly relics of humanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from such a scene he would return to snatch another hour or two of slumber to repair the abuses of the night and refresh himself for the labours of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> few lads could have been more insensible to the impressions of a life thus passed among the ensigns of mortality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mind was closed against all general considerations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was incapable of interest in the fate and fortunes of another the slave of his own desires and low ambitions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cold light and selfish in the last resort he had that modicum of prudence miscalled morality which keeps a man from inconvenient drunkenness or punishable theft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he coveted besides a measure of consideration from his masters and his fellowpupils and he had no desire to fail conspicuously in the external parts of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus he made it his pleasure to gain some distinction in his studies and day after day rendered unimpeachable eyeservice to his employer mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for his day of work he indemnified himself by nights of roaring blackguardly enjoyment and when that balance had been struck the organ that he called his conscience declared itself content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the supply of subjects was a continual trouble to him as well as to his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that large and busy class the raw material of the anatomists kept perpetually running out and the business thus rendered necessary was not only unpleasant in itself but threatened dangerous consequences to all who were concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the policy of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> k to ask no questions in his dealings with the trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they bring the body and we pay the price he used to say dwelling on the alliteration quid pro quo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and again and somewhat profanely ask no questions he would tell his assistants for conscience sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no understanding that the subjects were provided by the crime of murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had that idea been broached to him in words he would have recoiled in horror but the lightness of his speech upon so grave a matter was in itself an offence against good manners and a temptation to the men with whom he dealt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes for instance had often remarked to himself upon the singular freshness of the bodies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been struck again and again by the hangdog abominable looks of the ruffians who came to him before the dawn and putting things together clearly in his private thoughts he perhaps attributed a meaning too immoral and too categorical to the unguarded counsels of his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he understood his duty in short to have three branches to take what was brought to pay the price and to avert the eye from any evidence of crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one november morning this policy of silence was put sharply to the test <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been awake all night with a racking toothache pacing his room like a caged beast or throwing himself in fury on his bed and had fallen at last into that profound uneasy slumber that so often follows on a night of pain when he was awakened by the third or fourth angry repetition of the concerted signal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a thin bright moonshine it was bitter cold windy and frosty the town had not yet awakened but an indefinable stir already preluded the noise and business of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ghouls had come later than usual and they seemed more than usually eager to be gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes sick with sleep lighted them upstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard their grumbling irish voices through a dream and as they stripped the sack from their sad merchandise he leaned dozing with his shoulder propped against the wall he had to shake himself to find the men their money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he did so his eyes lighted on the dead face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he started he took two steps nearer with the candle raised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men answered nothing but they shuffled nearer the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know her i tell you he continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was alive and hearty yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its impossible she can be dead its sure sir youre mistaken entirely said one of the men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the other looked fettes darkly in the eyes and demanded the money on the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was impossible to misconceive the threat or to exaggerate the danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stammered some excuses counted out the sum and saw his hateful visitors depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner were they gone than he hastened to confirm his doubts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by a dozen unquestionable marks he identified the girl he had jested with the day before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw with horror marks upon her body that might well betoken violence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a panic seized him and he took refuge in his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he reflected at length over the discovery that he had made considered soberly the bearing of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ks instructions and the danger to himself of interference in so serious a business and at last in sore perplexity determined to wait for the advice of his immediate superior the class assistant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a young doctor wolfe macfarlane a high favourite among all the reckless students clever dissipated and unscrupulous to the last degree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had travelled and studied abroad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his manners were agreeable and a little forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was an authority on the stage skilful on the ice or the links with skate or golfclub he dressed with nice audacity and to put the finishing touch upon his glory he kept a gig and a strong trottinghorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with fettes he was on terms of intimacy indeed their relative positions called for some community of life and when subjects were scarce the pair would drive far into the country in macfarlanes gig visit and desecrate some lonely graveyard and return before dawn with their booty to the door of the dissectingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on that particular morning macfarlane arrived somewhat earlier than his wont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes heard him and met him on the stairs told him his story and showed him the cause of his alarm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macfarlane examined the marks on her body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you want to do anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some one else might recognise her objected fettes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she well hope not said macfarlane and if anybody does well you didnt dont you see and theres an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact is this has been going on too long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stir up the mud and youll get k into the most unholy trouble youll be in a shocking box yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so will i if you come to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like to know how any one of us would look or what the devil we should have to say for ourselves in any christian witnessbox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for me you know theres one thing certain that practically speaking all our subjects have been macfarlane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as if you hadnt suspected and proof another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i know and im as sorry as you are this should have come here tapping the body with his cane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next best thing for me is not to recognise it and he added coolly i dont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont dictate but i think a man of the world would do as i do and i may add i fancy that is what k would look for at our hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the question is why did he choose us two for his this was the tone of all others to affect the mind of a lad like fettes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the body of the unfortunate girl was duly dissected and no one remarked or appeared to recognise her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one afternoon when his days work was over fettes dropped into a popular tavern and found macfarlane sitting with a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a small man very pale and dark with coalblack eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cut of his features gave a promise of intellect and refinement which was but feebly realised in his manners for he proved upon a nearer acquaintance coarse vulgar and stupid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exercised however a very remarkable control over macfarlane issued orders like the great bashaw became inflamed at the least discussion or delay and commented rudely on the servility with which he was obeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this most offensive person took a fancy to fettes on the spot plied him with drinks and honoured him with unusual confidences on his past career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a tenth part of what he confessed were true he was a very loathsome rogue and the lads vanity was tickled by the attention of so experienced a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a pretty bad fellow myself the stranger remarked but macfarlane is the boy toddy macfarlane i call him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toddy order your friend another glass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or it might be toddy you jump up and shut the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toddy hates me he said dont you call me that confounded name growled macfarlane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you ever see the lads play knife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would like to do that all over my body remarked the stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we medicals have a better way than that said fettes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macfarlane looked up sharply as though this jest were scarcely to his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gray for that was the strangers name invited fettes to join them at dinner ordered a feast so sumptuous that the tavern was thrown into commotion and when all was done commanded macfarlane to settle the bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was late before they separated the man gray was incapably drunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macfarlane sobered by his fury chewed the cud of the money he had been forced to squander and the slights he had been obliged to swallow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes with various liquors singing in his head returned home with devious footsteps and a mind entirely in abeyance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next day macfarlane was absent from the class and fettes smiled to himself as he imagined him still squiring the intolerable gray from tavern to tavern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as the hour of liberty had struck he posted from place to place in quest of his last nights companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could find them however nowhere so returned early to his rooms went early to bed and slept the sleep of the just <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at four in the morning he was awakened by the wellknown signal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> descending to the door he was filled with astonishment to find macfarlane with his gig and in the gig one of those long and ghastly packages with which he was so well acquainted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how did you but macfarlane silenced him roughly bidding him turn to business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they had got the body upstairs and laid it on the table macfarlane made at first as if he were going away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he paused and seemed to hesitate and then you had better look at the face said he in tones of some constraint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had better he repeated as fettes only stared at him in wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but where and how and when did you come by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at the face was the only answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes was staggered strange doubts assailed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked from the young doctor to the body and then back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last with a start he did as he was bidden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had almost expected the sight that met his eyes and yet the shock was cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to see fixed in the rigidity of death and naked on that coarse layer of sackcloth the man whom he had left well clad and full of meat and sin upon the threshold of a tavern awoke even in the thoughtless fettes some of the terrors of the conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a cras tibi which reechoed in his soul that two whom he had known should have come to lie upon these icy tables <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet these were only secondary thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unprepared for a challenge so momentous he knew not how to look his comrade in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he durst not meet his eye and he had neither words nor voice at his command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was macfarlane himself who made the first advance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came up quietly behind and laid his hand gently but firmly on the others shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now richardson was a student who had long been anxious for that portion of the human subject to dissect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no answer and the murderer resumed talking of business you fettes found a voice the ghost of his own pay you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he why yes of course you must <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by all means and on every possible account you must returned the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dare not give it for nothing you dare not take it for nothing it would compromise us both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is another case like jane galbraiths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more things are wrong the more we must act there answered fettes hoarsely pointing to a cupboard in the corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me the key then said the other calmly holding out his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an instants hesitation and the die was cast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macfarlane could not suppress a nervous twitch the infinitesimal mark of an immense relief as he felt the key between his fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he opened the cupboard brought out pen and ink and a paperbook that stood in one compartment and separated from the funds in a drawer a sum suitable to the occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now look here he said there is the payment made first proof of your good faith first step to your security <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have now to clinch it by a second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> enter the payment in your the next few seconds were for fettes an agony of thought but in balancing his terrors it was the most immediate that triumphed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any future difficulty seemed almost welcome if he could avoid a present quarrel with macfarlane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he set down the candle which he had been carrying all this time and with a steady hand entered the date the nature and the amount of the transaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now said macfarlane its only fair that you should pocket the lucre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the bye when a man of the world falls into a bit of luck has a few shillings extra in his pocket im ashamed to speak of it but theres a rule of conduct in the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no treating no purchase of expensive classbooks no squaring of old debts macfarlane began fettes still somewhat hoarsely i have to oblige me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you did as near as i can see the matter what you downright had to do in self defence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose i got into trouble where would you be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this second little matter flows clearly from the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gray is the continuation of miss galbraith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant begin and then stop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you begin you must keep on beginning a horrible sense of blackness and the treachery of fate seized hold upon the soul of the unhappy student <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried but what have i done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be made a class assistant in the name of reason wheres the harm in that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> service wanted the position service might have got it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would he have been where i am my dear fellow said macfarlane what a boy you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what harm has come to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what harm can come to you if you hold your tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why man do you know what this life is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are two squads of us the lions and the lambs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youre a lamb youll come to lie upon these tables like gray or jane galbraith if youre a lion youll live and drive a horse like me like k like all the world with any wit or courage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear fellow youre clever you have pluck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like you and k likes you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were born to lead the hunt and i tell you on my honour and my experience of life three days from now youll laugh at all these scarecrows like a high school boy and with that macfarlane took his departure and drove off up the wynd in his gig to get under cover before daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes was thus left alone with his regrets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the miserable peril in which he stood involved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw with inexpressible dismay that there was no limit to his weakness and that from concession to concession he had fallen from the arbiter of macfarlanes destiny to his paid and helpless accomplice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have given the world to have been a little braver at the time but it did not occur to him that he might still be brave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the secret of jane galbraith and the cursed entry in the daybook closed his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hours passed the class began to arrive the members of the unhappy gray were dealt out to one and to another and received without remark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> richardson was made happy with the head and before the hour of freedom rang fettes trembled with exultation to perceive how far they had already gone toward safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for two days he continued to watch with increasing joy the dreadful process of disguise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the third day macfarlane made his appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been ill he said but he made up for lost time by the energy with which he directed the students <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to richardson in particular he extended the most valuable assistance and advice and that student encouraged by the praise of the demonstrator burned high with ambitious hopes and saw the medal already in his grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the week was out macfarlanes prophecy had been fulfilled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes had outlived his terrors and had forgotten his baseness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to plume himself upon his courage and had so arranged the story in his mind that he could look back on these events with an unhealthy pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of his accomplice he saw but little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they met of course in the business of the class they received their orders together from mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times they had a word or two in private and macfarlane was from first to last particularly kind and jovial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was plain that he avoided any reference to their common secret and even when fettes whispered to him that he had cast in his lot with the lions and foresworn the lambs he only signed to him smilingly to hold his peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length an occasion arose which threw the pair once more into a closer union <end> <end> 
<start> <start> k was again short of subjects pupils were eager and it was a part of this teachers pretensions to be always well supplied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time there came the news of a burial in the rustic graveyard of glencorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time has little changed the place in question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it stood then as now upon a cross road out of call of human habitations and buried fathom deep in the foliage of six cedar trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cries of the sheep upon the neighbouring hills the streamlets upon either hand one loudly singing among pebbles the other dripping furtively from pond to pond the stir of the wind in mountainous old flowering chestnuts and once in seven days the voice of the bell and the old tunes of the precentor were the only sounds that disturbed the silence around the rural church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the resurrection man to use a byname of the period was not to be deterred by any of the sanctities of customary piety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was part of his trade to despise and desecrate the scrolls and trumpets of old tombs the paths worn by the feet of worshippers and mourners and the offerings and the inscriptions of bereaved affection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to rustic neighbourhoods where love is more than commonly tenacious and where some bonds of blood or fellowship unite the entire society of a parish the bodysnatcher far from being repelled by natural respect was attracted by the ease and safety of the task <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to bodies that had been laid in earth in joyful expectation of a far different awakening there came that hasty lamplit terrorhaunted resurrection of the spade and mattock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coffin was forced the cerements torn and the melancholy relics clad in sackcloth after being rattled for hours on moonless byways were at length exposed to uttermost indignities before a class of gaping boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somewhat as two vultures may swoop upon a dying lamb fettes and macfarlane were to be let loose upon a grave in that green and quiet restingplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wife of a farmer a woman who had lived for sixty years and been known for nothing but good butter and a godly conversation was to be rooted from her grave at midnight and carried dead and naked to that faraway city that she had always honoured with her sundays best the place beside her family was to be empty till the crack of doom her innocent and almost venerable members to be exposed to that last curiosity of the anatomist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> late one afternoon the pair set forth well wrapped in cloaks and furnished with a formidable bottle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it rained without remission a cold dense lashing rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now and again there blew a puff of wind but these sheets of falling water kept it down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bottle and all it was a sad and silent drive as far as penicuik where they were to spend the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stopped once to hide their implements in a thick bush not far from the churchyard and once again at the fishers tryst to have a toast before the kitchen fire and vary their nips of whisky with a glass of ale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they reached their journeys end the gig was housed the horse was fed and comforted and the two young doctors in a private room sat down to the best dinner and the best wine the house afforded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lights the fire the beating rain upon the window the cold incongruous work that lay before them added zest to their enjoyment of the meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with every glass their cordiality increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon macfarlane handed a little pile of gold to his companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between friends these little dd fettes pocketed the money and applauded the sentiment to the echo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are a philosopher he cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was an ass till i knew you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and k between you by the lord harry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of course we shall applauded macfarlane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you it required a man to back me up the other morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some big brawling fortyyearold cowards who would have turned sick at the look of the dd thing but not well and why not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was no affair of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing to gain on the one side but disturbance and on the other i could count on your gratitude dont you see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he slapped his pocket till the gold pieces rang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macfarlane somehow felt a certain touch of alarm at these unpleasant words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may have regretted that he had taught his young companion so successfully but he had no time to interfere for the other noisily continued in this boastful the great thing is not to be afraid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now between you and me i dont want to hang thats practical but for all cant macfarlane i was born with a contempt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell god devil right wrong sin crime and all the old gallery of curiosities they may frighten boys but men of the world like you and me despise them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres to the memory of it was by this time growing somewhat late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gig according to order was brought round to the door with both lamps brightly shining and the young men had to pay their bill and take the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they announced that they were bound for peebles and drove in that direction till they were clear of the last houses of the town then extinguishing the lamps returned upon their course and followed a byroad toward glencorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no sound but that of their own passage and the incessant strident pouring of the rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was pitch dark here and there a white gate or a white stone in the wall guided them for a short space across the night but for the most part it was at a foot pace and almost groping that they picked their way through that resonant blackness to their solemn and isolated destination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the sunken woods that traverse the neighbourhood of the burying ground the last glimmer failed them and it became necessary to kindle a match and reillumine one of the lanterns of the gig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus under the dripping trees and environed by huge and moving shadows they reached the scene of their unhallowed labours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were both experienced in such affairs and powerful with the spade and they had scarce been twenty minutes at their task before they were rewarded by a dull rattle on the coffin lid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same moment macfarlane having hurt his hand upon a stone flung it carelessly above his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grave in which they now stood almost to the shoulders was close to the edge of the plateau of the graveyard and the gig lamp had been propped the better to illuminate their labours against a tree and on the immediate verge of the steep bank descending to the stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chance had taken a sure aim with the stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came a clang of broken glass night fell upon them sounds alternately dull and ringing announced the bounding of the lantern down the bank and its occasional collision with the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stone or two which it had dislodged in its descent rattled behind it into the profundities of the glen and then silence like night resumed its sway and they might bend their hearing to its utmost pitch but naught was to be heard except the rain now marching to the wind now steadily falling over miles of open country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were so nearly at an end of their abhorred task that they judged it wisest to complete it in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coffin was exhumed and broken open the body inserted in the dripping sack and carried between them to the gig one mounted to keep it in its place and the other taking the horse by the mouth groped along by wall and bush until they reached the wider road by the fishers tryst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here was a faint diffused radiancy which they hailed like daylight by that they pushed the horse to a good pace and began to rattle along merrily in the direction of the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had both been wetted to the skin during their operations and now as the gig jumped among the deep ruts the thing that stood propped between them fell now upon one and now upon the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at every repetition of the horrid contact each instinctively repelled it with the greater haste and the process natural although it was began to tell upon the nerves of the companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macfarlane made some illfavoured jest about the farmers wife but it came hollowly from his lips and was allowed to drop in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still their unnatural burden bumped from side to side and now the head would be laid as if in confidence upon their shoulders and now the drenching sackcloth would flap icily about their faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a creeping chill began to possess the soul of fettes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he peered at the bundle and it seemed somehow larger than at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all over the countryside and from every degree of distance the farm dogs accompanied their passage with tragic ululations and it grew and grew upon his mind that some unnatural miracle had been accomplished that some nameless change had befallen the dead body and that it was in fear of their unholy burden that the dogs were howling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gods sake said he making a great effort to arrive at seemingly macfarlane was affected in the same direction for though he made no reply he stopped the horse passed the reins to his companion got down and proceeded to kindle the remaining lamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had by that time got no farther than the crossroad down to auchenclinny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rain still poured as though the deluge were returning and it was no easy matter to make a light in such a world of wet and darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when at last the flickering blue flame had been transferred to the wick and began to expand and clarify and shed a wide circle of misty brightness round the gig it became possible for the two young men to see each other and the thing they had along with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rain had moulded the rough sacking to the outlines of the body underneath the head was distinct from the trunk the shoulders plainly modelled something at once spectral and human riveted their eyes upon the ghastly comrade of their drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some time macfarlane stood motionless holding up the lamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a nameless dread was swathed like a wet sheet about the body and tightened the white skin upon the face of fettes a fear that was meaningless a horror of what could not be kept mounting to his brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another beat of the watch and he had spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is not a woman said macfarlane in a hushed voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a woman when we put her in whispered fettes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as fettes took the lamp his companion untied the fastenings of the sack and drew down the cover from the head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light fell very clear upon the dark wellmoulded features and smoothshaven cheeks of a too familiar countenance often beheld in dreams of both of these young men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wild yell rang up into the night each leaped from his own side into the roadway the lamp fell broke and was extinguished and the horse terrified by this unusual commotion bounded and went off toward edinburgh at a gallop bearing along with it sole occupant of the gig the body of the dead and longdissected gray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when dick naseby was in paris he made some odd acquaintances for he was one of those who have ears to hear and can use their eyes no less than their intelligence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made as many thoughts as stuart mill but his philosophy concerned flesh and blood and was experimental as to its method <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a typehunter among mankind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he despised small game and insignificant personalities whether in the shape of dukes or bagmen letting them go by like seaweed but show him a refined or powerful face let him hear a plangent or a penetrating voice fish for him with a living look in some ones eye a passionate gesture a meaning and ambiguous smile and his mind was instantaneously awakened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a man there was a woman he seemed to say and he stood up to the task of comprehension with the delight of an artist in his art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and indeed rightly considered this interest of his was an artistic interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no science in the personal study of human nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all comprehension is creation the woman i love is somewhat of my handiwork and the great lover like the great painter is he that can so embellish his subject as to make her more than human whilst yet by a cunning art he has so based his apotheosis on the nature of the case that the woman can go on being a true woman and give her character free play and show littleness or cherish spite or be greedy of common pleasures and he continue to worship without a thought of incongruity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to love a character is only the heroic way of understanding it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we love by some noble method of our own or some nobility of mien or nature in the other we apprehend the loved one by what is noblest in ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we are merely studying an eccentricity the method of our study is but a series of allowances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to begin to understand is to begin to sympathise for comprehension comes only when we have stated anothers faults and virtues in terms of our own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence the proverbial toleration of artists for their own evil creations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hence too it came about that dick naseby a highminded creature and as scrupulous and brave a gentleman as you would want to meet held in a sort of affection the various human creeping things whom he had met and studied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter van tromp an englishspeaking twolegged animal of the international genus and by profession of general and more than equivocal utility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> years before he had been a painter of some standing in a colony and portraits signed van tromp had celebrated the greatness of colonial governors and judges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in those days he had been married and driven his wife and infant daughter in a pony trap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what were the steps of his declension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he was at least and had been any time these past ten years a sort of dismal parasite upon the foreigner in paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it occurred to me that youd probably be in the smokingroom and that it wouldnt be too late to repair my omission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to do something civil to you so i put on my coat and came down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall read your book again when i go up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our friend faced round in his place he was touched as he had scarce ever been by the picture of such a demonstration in his favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre really the kindest of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ive been sitting here with you all this time and never apprehended it and never thanked you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank miss fancourt it was she who wound me up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has made me feel as if i had read your novel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never seen any one like her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her interest in literatures touching something quite peculiar to herself she takes it all so seriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she feels the arts and she wants to feel them more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to those who practise them its almost humiliating her curiosity her sympathy her good faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can anything be as fine as she supposes it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes a rare organisation the younger man sighed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the richest ive ever seen an artistic intelligence really of the first order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and lodged in such a form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one would like to represent such a girl as that paul continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah there it is theres nothing like life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when youre finished squeezed dry and used up and you think the sacks empty youre still appealed to you still get touches and thrills the idea springs up out of the lap of the actual and shows you theres always something to be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i shant do it shes not for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do you mean not for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh its all over shes for you if you like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes not for a dingy little man of letters shes for the world the bright rich world of bribes and rewards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the world will take hold of her it will carry her away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will try but its just a case in which there may be a fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be worth fighting for a man who had it in him with youth and talent on his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these words rang not a little in paul overts consciousness they held him briefly silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a wonder she has remained as she is giving herself away so with so much to give away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remaining you mean so ingenuous so natural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh she doesnt care a straw she gives away because she overflows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has her own feelings her own standards she doesnt keep remembering that she must be proud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then she hasnt been here long enough to be spoiled she has picked up a fashion or two but only the amusing ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes a provincial a provincial of genius st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george went on her very blunders are charming her mistakes are interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has come back from asia with all sorts of excited curiosities and unappeased appetities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes firstrate herself and she expends herself on the secondrate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes life herself and she takes a rare interest in imitations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she mixes all things up but there are none in regard to which she hasnt perceptions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sees things in a perspective as if from the top of the himalayas and she enlarges everything she touches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above all she exaggerates to herself i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing in that description to allay the agitation caused in our younger friend by such a sketch of a fine subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him to show the art of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> georges admired hand and he lost himself in gazing at the vision this hovered there before him of a womans figure which should be part of the glory of a novel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the end of a moment the thing had turned into smoke and out of the smoke the last puff of a big cigar proceeded the voice of general fancourt who had left the others and come and planted himself before the gentlemen on the sofa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose that when you fellows get talking you sit up half the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i follow a hygiene and st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see youre hothouse plants laughed the general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way you produce your flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i produce mine between ten and one every morning i bloom with a regularity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> added the polite general while paul noted how little the author of shadowmere minded as he phrased it to himself when addressed as a celebrated storyteller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man had an idea he should never get used to that it would always make him uncomfortable from the suspicion that people would think they had to and he would want to prevent it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently his great colleague had toughened and hardened had made himself a surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the group of men had finished their cigars and taken up their bedroom candlesticks but before they all passed out lord watermouth invited the pair of guests who had been so absorbed together to have something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened that they both declined upon which general fancourt said is that the hygiene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george replied but leaving the room still at his young friends side he added whimsically for the latters benefit in a lower tone my wife doesnt let me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well im glad im not one of you fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nearness of summersoft to london had this consequence chilling to a person who had had a vision of sociability in a railway carriage that most of the company after breakfast drove back to town entering their own vehicles which had come out to fetch them while their servants returned by train with their luggage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three or four young men among whom was paul overt also availed themselves of the common convenience but they stood in the portico of the house and saw the others roll away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss fancourt got into a victoria with her father after she had shaken hands with our hero and said smiling in the frankest way in the world i must see you more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george is so nice she has promised to ask us both to dinner together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this lady and her husband took their places in a perfectlyappointed brougham she required a closed carriage and as our young man waved his hat to them in response to their nods and flourishes he reflected that taken together they were an honourable image of success of the material rewards and the social credit of literature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such things were not the full measure but he nevertheless felt a little proud for literature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before a week had elapsed he met miss fancourt in bond street at a private view of the works of a young artist in blackandwhite who had been so good as to invite him to the stuffy scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the drawings were admirable but the crowd in the one little room was so dense that he felt himself up to his neck in a sack of wool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fringe of people at the outer edge endeavoured by curving forward their backs and presenting below them a still more convex surface of resistance to the pressure of the mass to preserve an interval between their noses and the glazed mounts of the pictures while the central body in the comparative gloom projected by a wide horizontal screen hung under the skylight and allowing only a margin for the day remained upright dense and vague lost in the contemplation of its own ingredients <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this contemplation sat especially in the sad eyes of certain female heads surmounted with hats of strange convolution and plumage which rose on long necks above the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the heads paul perceived was much the so most beautiful of the collection and his next discovery was that it belonged to miss fancourt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its beauty was enhanced by the glad smile she sent him across surrounding obstructions a smile that drew him to her as fast as he could make his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seen for himself at summersoft that the last thing her nature contained was an affectation of indifference yet even with this circumspection he took a fresh satisfaction in her not having pretended to await his arrival with composure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she smiled as radiantly as if she wished to make him hurry and as soon as he came within earshot she broke out in her voice of joy hes here hes here hes coming back in a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul returned as she offered him her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh dear no this isnt in my poor fathers line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has just left me to speak to some one hes coming back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its he who brought me wasnt it charming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah that gives him a pull over me i couldnt have brought you could i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you had been so kind as to propose it why not you as well as he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl returned with a face that expressing no cheap coquetry simply affirmed a happy fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why hes a pere de famille <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then quickly will you go to see places with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what you mean that girls have to have a lot of people then she broke off i dont know im free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive always been like that i can go about with any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im so glad to meet you she added with a sweet distinctness that made those near her turn round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me at least repay that speech by taking you out of this squash her friend said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no theyre awfully mornes arent they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im very happy indeed and i promised mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george to remain in this spot till he comes back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes going to take me away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they send him invitations for things of this sort more than he wants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so kind of him to think of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they also send me invitations of this kind more than i want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if thinking of you will do it  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i delight in them everything thats life everything thats london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont have private views in asia i suppose he laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what a pity that for this year even in this gorged city theyre pretty well over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well next year will do for i hope you believe were going to be friends always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss fancourt continued before paul had time to respond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george in the gaps of the crowd and this perhaps led to his hurrying a little to say i hope that doesnt mean im to wait till next year to see you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no arent we to meet at dinner on the twentyfifth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she panted with an eagerness as happy as his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there no means of seeing you before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stared with all her brightness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a shot if youll be so good as to ask me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on sunday then this next sunday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what have i done that you should doubt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man asked with delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss fancourt turned instantly to st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george who had now joined them and announced triumphantly hes coming on sunday this next sunday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah my day my day too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the famous novelist laughing to their companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you shall meet in manchester square you shall talk you shall be wonderful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont meet often enough st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george allowed shaking hands with his disciple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too many things ah too many things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we must make it up in the country in september <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wont forget youve promised me that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why hes coming on the twentyfifth youll see him then said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dine with you i hope you havent forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes dining out that day she added gaily to paul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh bless me yes thats charming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wife didnt tell me st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too many things too many things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too many people too many people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul exclaimed giving ground before the penetration of an elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like to see them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only two or three at most the young man returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you ever hear anything like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knows haughtily how good he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george declared laughing to miss fancourt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they read me but that doesnt make me like them any better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come away from them come away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he led the way out of the exhibition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes going to take me to the park miss fancourt observed to overt with elation as they passed along the corridor that led to the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul asked taking the fact for a somewhat unexpected illustration of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a beautiful day therell be a great crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to look at the people to look at types the girl went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall sit under the trees we shall walk by the row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go once a year on business said st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george who had overheard pauls question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or with a country cousin didnt you tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued over her shoulder to paul as their friend drew her toward a hansom to which he had signalled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man watched them get in he returned as he stood there the friendly wave of the hand with which ensconced in the vehicle beside her st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he even lingered to see the vehicle start away and lose itself in the confusion of bond street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he followed it with his eyes it put to him embarrassing things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great novelist had said emphatically at summersoft but his manner of conducting himself toward her appeared not quite in harmony with such a conviction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could he have behaved differently if she had been for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an indefinite envy rose in paul overts heart as he took his way on foot alone a feeling addressed alike strangely enough to each of the occupants of the hansom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much he should like to rattle about london with such a girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much he should like to go and look at types with st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next sunday at four oclock he called in manchester square where his secret wish was gratified by his finding miss fancourt alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was in a large bright friendly occupied room which was painted red all over draped with the quaint cheap florid stuffs that are represented as coming from southern and eastern countries where they are fabled to serve as the counterpanes of the peasantry and bedecked with pottery of vivid hues ranged on casual shelves and with many watercolour drawings from the hand as the visitor learned of the young lady herself commemorating with a brave breadth the sunsets the mountains the temples and palaces of india <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat an hour more than an hour two hours and all the while no one came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hostess was so good as to remark with her liberal humanity that it was delightful they werent interrupted it was so rare in london especially at that season that people got a good talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but luckily now of a fine sunday half the world went out of town and that made it better for those who didnt go when these others were in sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the defect of london one of two or three the very short list of those she recognised in the teeming worldcity she adored that there were too few good chances for talk you never had time to carry anything far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too many things too many things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> georges exclamation of a few days before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah yes for him there are too many his lifes too complicated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what i should like to do it might explain some mysteries her visitor went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked him what mysteries he meant and he said oh peculiarities of his work inequalities superficialities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for one who looks at it from the artistic point of view it contains a bottomless ambiguity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she became at this on the spot all intensity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah do describe that more its so interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are no such suggestive questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thinks hes a failure fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that depends on what his ideal may have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with his gifts it ought to have been high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but till one knows what he really proposed to himself  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh he doesnt talk to me about himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul was on the point of asking what then he did talk about but discretion checked it and he said instead do you think hes unhappy at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean in his relations with his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has a mystifying little way of alluding to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not to me said marian fancourt with her clear eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that wouldnt be right would it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not particularly so im glad he doesnt mention her to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to praise her might bore you and he has no business to do anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet he knows you better than me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl cried as with envy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her visitor stared a moment then broke into a laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course but not in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he respects what youve done he told me so the other day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul drank it in but retained his faculties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you went to look at types <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes we found so many he has such an observation of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he talked a great deal about your book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the author of the work in question groaned for joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was wonderfully amusing he was inexpressibly droll while we walked about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sees everything he has so many comparisons and images and theyre always exactly right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cest dun trouve as they say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes with his gifts such things as he ought to have done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dont you think he has done them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah it was just the point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a part of them and of course even that parts immense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he might have been one of the greatest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however let us not make this an hour of qualifications <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even as they stand our friend earnestly concluded his writings are a mine of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this proposition she ardently responded and for half an hour the pair talked over the masters principal productions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew them well she knew them even better than her visitor who was struck with her critical intelligence and with something large and bold in the movement in her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said things that startled him and that evidently had come to her directly they werent pickedup phrases she placed them too well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george had been right about her being firstrate about her not being afraid to gush not remembering that she must be proud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly something came back to her and she said i recollect that he did speak of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said apropos of something or other that she didnt care for perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a great crime in an artists wife paul returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the girl sighed with a suggestion of many reflexions some of them mitigating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she presently added ah perfection perfection how one ought to go in for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every one can in his way her companion opined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his way yes but not in hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> women are so hampered so condemned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet its a kind of dishonour if you dont when you want to do something isnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss fancourt pursued dropping one train in her quickness to take up another an accident that was common with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so these two young persons sat discussing high themes in their eclectic drawingroom in their london season discussing with extreme seriousness the high theme of perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be said in extenuation of this eccentricity that they were interested in the business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their tone had truth and their emotion beauty they werent posturing for each other or for some one else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the subject was so wide that they found themselves reducing it the perfection to which for the moment they agreed to confine their speculations was that of the valid the exemplary work of art <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our young womans imagination it appeared had wandered far in that direction and her guest had the rare delight of feeling in their conversation a full interchange <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this episode will have lived for years in his memory and even in his wonder it had the quality that fortune distils in a single drop at a time the quality that lubricates many ensuing frictions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still whenever he likes has a vision of the room the bright red sociable talkative room with the curtains that by a stroke of successful audacity had the note of vivid blue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remembers where certain things stood the particular book open on the table and the almost intense odour of the flowers placed at the left somewhere behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these facts were the fringe as it were of a fine special agitation which had its birth in those two hours and of which perhaps the main sign was in its leading him inwardly and repeatedly to breathe i had no idea there was any one like this i had no idea there was any one like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her freedom amazed him and charmed him it seemed so to simplify the practical question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was on the footing of an independent personage a motherless girl who had passed out of her teens and had a position and responsibilities who wasnt held down to the limitations of a little miss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she came and went with no dragged duenna she received people alone and though she was totally without hardness the question of protection or patronage had no relevancy in regard to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave such an impression of the clear and the noble combined with the easy and the natural that in spite of her eminent modern situation she suggested no sort of sisterhood with the fast girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> modern she was indeed and made paul overt who loved old colour the golden glaze of time think with some alarm of the muddled palette of the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he couldnt get used to her interest in the arts he cared for it seemed too good to be real it was so unlikely an adventure to tumble into such a well of sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one might stray into the desert easily that was on the cards and that was the law of life but it was too rare an accident to stumble on a crystal well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet if her aspirations seemed at one moment too extravagant to be real they struck him at the next as too intelligent to be false <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were both high and lame and whims for whims he preferred them to any he had met in a like relation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was probable enough she would leave them behind exchange them for politics or smartness or mere prolific maternity as was the custom of scribbling daubing educated flattered girls in an age of luxury and a society of leisure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he noted that the watercolours on the walls of the room she sat in had mainly the quality of being naives and reflected that naivete in art is like a zero in a number its importance depends on the figure it is united with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile however he had fallen in love with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before he went away at any rate he said to her i thought st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george was coming to see you today but he doesnt turn up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he supposed she was going to cry comment donc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you come here only to meet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the next he became aware of how little such a speech would have fallen in with any note of flirtation he had as yet perceived in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she only replied ah yes but i dont think hell come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he recommended me not to expect him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she gaily but all gently added he said it wasnt fair to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i think i could manage two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so could i paul overt returned stretching the point a little to meet her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in reality his appreciation of the occasion was so completely an appreciation of the woman before him that another figure in the scene even so esteemed a one as st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george might for the hour have appealed to him vainly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left the house wondering what the great man had meant by its not being fair to him and still more than that whether he had actually stayed away from the force of that idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he took his course through the sunday solitude of manchester square swinging his stick and with a good deal of emotion fermenting in his soul it appeared to him he was living in a world strangely magnanimous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss fancourt had told him it was possible she should be away and that her father should be on the following sunday but that she had the hope of a visit from him in the other event <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she promised to let him know should their absence fail and then he might act accordingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after he had passed into one of the streets that open from the square he stopped without definite intentions looking sceptically for a cab <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment he saw a hansom roll through the place from the other side and come a part of the way toward him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was on the point of hailing the driver when he noticed a fare within then he waited seeing the man prepare to deposit his passenger by pulling up at one of the houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house was apparently the one he himself had just quitted at least he drew that inference as he recognised henry st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george in the person who stepped out of the hansom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul turned off as quickly as if he had been caught in the act of spying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave up his cab he preferred to walk he would go nowhere else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george hadnt renounced his visit altogether that would have been too absurd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes the world was magnanimous and even he himself felt so as on looking at his watch he noted but six oclock so that he could mentally congratulate his successor on having an hour still to sit in miss fancourts drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he himself might use that hour for another visit but by the time he reached the marble arch the idea of such a course had become incongruous to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he passed beneath that architectural effort and walked into the park till he got upon the spreading grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he continued to walk he took his way across the elastic turf and came out by the serpentine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he watched with a friendly eye the diversions of the london people he bent a glance almost encouraging on the young ladies paddling their sweethearts about the lake and the guardsmen tickling tenderly with their bearskins the artificial flowers in the sunday hats of their partners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he prolonged his meditative walk he went into kensington gardens he sat upon the penny chairs he looked at the little sailboats launched upon the round pond and was glad he had no engagement to dine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he repaired for this purpose very late to his club where he found himself unable to order a repast and told the waiter to bring whatever there was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he didnt even observe what he was served with and he spent the evening in the library of the establishment pretending to read an article in an american magazine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he failed to discover what it was about it appeared in a dim way to be about marian fancourt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite late in the week she wrote to him that she was not to go into the country it had only just been settled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her father she added would never settle anything but put it all on her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt her responsibility she had to and since she was forced this was the way she had decided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she mentioned no reasons which gave our friend all the clearer field for bold conjecture about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in manchester square on this second sunday he esteemed his fortune less good for she had three or four other visitors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there were three or four compensations perhaps the greatest of which was that learning how her father had after all at the last hour gone out of town alone the bold conjecture i just now spoke of found itself becoming a shade more bold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then her presence was her presence and the personal red room was there and was full of it whatever phantoms passed and vanished emitting incomprehensible sounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lastly he had the resource of staying till every one had come and gone and of believing this grateful to her though she gave no particular sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were alone together he came to his point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw him as i looked back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but it was the last time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said he would never come again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does he mean he wishes to cease to see you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bradley swung the helm hard to starboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could feel the u respond and yet the arrow still clung straight and sure toward the distant cliffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you make of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you ever hear of caproni <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he followed cook about  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is scarcely mentioned even by contemporaneous historiansprobably because he got into political difficulties on his return to italy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the fashion to scoff at his claims but i recall reading one of his workshis only one i believein which he described a new continent in the south seas a continent made up of some strange metal which attracted the compass a rockbound inhospitable coast without beach or harbor which extended for hundreds of miles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could make no landing nor in the several days he cruised about it did he see sign of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called it caprona and sailed away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe sir that we are looking upon the coast of caprona uncharted and forgotten for two hundred years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are right it might account for much of the deviation of the compass during the past two days i suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caprona has been luring us upon her deadly rocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along that long front there must be a vulnerable spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will find it bradley for we must find it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must find water on caprona or we must die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so we approached the coast upon which no living eyes had ever rested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straight from the oceans depths rose towering cliffs shot with brown and blues and greenswithered moss and lichen and the verdigris of copper and everywhere the rusty ocher of iron pyrites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clifftops though ragged were of such uniform height as to suggest the boundaries of a great plateau and now and again we caught glimpses of verdure topping the rocky escarpment as though bush or jungleland had pushed outward from a lush vegetation farther inland to signal to an unseeing world that caprona lived and joyed in life beyond her austere and repellent coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but metaphor however poetic never slaked a dry throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to enjoy capronas romantic suggestions we must have water and so we came in close always sounding and skirted the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as close in as we dared cruise we found fathomless depths and always the same undented coastline of bald cliffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as darkness threatened we drew away and lay well off the coast all night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had not as yet really commenced to suffer for lack of water but i knew that it would not be long before we did and so at the first streak of dawn i moved in again and once more took up the hopeless survey of the forbidding coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toward noon we discovered a beach the first we had seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a narrow strip of sand at the base of a part of the cliff that seemed lower than any we had before scanned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at its foot half buried in the sand lay great boulders mute evidence that in a bygone age some mighty natural force had crumpled capronas barrier at this point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was bradley who first called our attention to a strange object lying among the boulders above the surf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looks like a man he said and passed his glasses to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked long and carefully and could have sworn that the thing i saw was the sprawled figure of a human being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss la rue was on deck with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned and asked her to go below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without a word she did as i bade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i stripped and as i did so nobs looked questioningly at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been wont at home to enter the surf with me and evidently he had not forgotten it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are you going to do sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to see what that thing is on shore i replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if its a man it may mean that caprona is inhabited or it may merely mean that some poor devils were shipwrecked here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to be able to tell from the clothing which is more near the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure you ought to carry a knoife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here you are sir cried one of the men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a long slim blade he offeredone that i could carry between my teethand so i accepted it gladly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep close in i directed bradley and then i dived over the side and struck out for the narrow beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was another splash directly behind me and turning my head i saw faithful old nobs swimming valiantly in my wake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surf was not heavy and there was no undertow so we made shore easily effecting an equally easy landing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beach was composed largely of small stones worn smooth by the action of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was little sand though from the deck of the u the beach had appeared to be all sand and i saw no evidences of mollusca or crustacea such as are common to all beaches i have previously seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i attribute this to the fact of the smallness of the beach the enormous depth of surrounding water and the great distance at which caprona lies from her nearest neighbor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as nobs and i approached the recumbent figure farther up the beach i was appraised by my nose that whether or not the thing had once been organic and alive but that for some time it had been dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little later he sat down upon his haunches raised his muzzle to the heavens and bayed forth a most dismal howl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shied a small stone at him and bade him shut uphis uncanny noise made me nervous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i had come quite close to the thing i still could not say whether it had been man or beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the carcass was badly swollen and partly decomposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no sign of clothing upon or about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fine brownish hair covered the chest and abdomen and the face the palms of the hands the feet the shoulders and back were practically hairless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the creature must have been about the height of a fair sized man its features were similar to those of a man yet had it been a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not say for it resembled an ape no more than it did a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its large toes protruded laterally as do those of the semiarboreal peoples of borneo the philippines and other remote regions where low types still persist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countenance might have been that of a cross between pithecanthropus the java apeman and a daughter of the piltdown race of prehistoric sussex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wooden cudgel lay beside the corpse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this fact set me thinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no wood of any description in sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing about the beach to suggest a wrecked mariner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was absolutely nothing about the body to suggest that it might possibly in life have known a maritime experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the body of a low type of man or a high type of beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in neither instance would it have been of a seafaring race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore i deduced that it was native to capronathat it lived inland and that it had fallen or been hurled from the cliffs above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such being the case caprona was inhabitable if not inhabited by man but how to reach the inhabitable interior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a closer view of the cliffs than had been afforded me from the deck of the u only confirmed my conviction that no mortal man could scale those perpendicular heights there was not a fingerhold not a toehold upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobs and i met with no sharks upon our return journey to the submarine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my report filled everyone with theories and speculations and with renewed hope and determination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all reasoned along the same lines that i had reasonedthe conclusions were obvious but not the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were now thirstier than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the balance of that day we spent in continuing a minute and fruitless exploration of the monotonous coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not another break in the frowning cliffsnot even another minute patch of pebbly beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the sun fell so did our spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had tried to make advances to the girl again but she would have none of me and so i was not only thirsty but otherwise sad and downhearted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was glad when the new day broke the hideous spell of a sleepless night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mornings search brought us no shred of hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caprona was impregnablethat was the decision of all yet we kept on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must have been about two bells of the afternoon watch that bradley called my attention to the branch of a tree with leaves upon it floating on the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may have been carried down to the ocean by a river he suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i replied it may have it may have tumbled or been thrown off the top of one of these cliffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought of that too he replied but i wanted to believe the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must believe the other until we prove it false <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant afford to give up heart now when we need heart most <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the branch was carried down by a river and we are going to find that river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i smote my open palm with a clenched fist to emphasize a determination unsupported by hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i pointed at a spot closer to shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some flowers and grasses and another leafy branch floated toward us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we both scanned the water and the coastline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bradley evidently discovered something or at least thought that he had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called down for a bucket and a rope and when they were passed up to him he lowered the former into the sea and drew it in filled with water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of this he took a taste and straightening up looked into my eyes with an expression of elationas much as to say i told you so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this water is warm he announced and fresh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i grabbed the bucket and tasted its contents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water was very warm and it was fresh but there was a most unpleasant taste to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you ever taste water from a stagnant pool full of tadpoles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats it i exclaimed thats just the taste exactly though i havent experienced it since boyhood but how can water from a flowing stream taste thus and what the dickens makes it so warm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be at least or fahrenheit possibly higher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes agreed bradley i should say higher but where does it come from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is easily discovered now that we have found it i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it cant come from the ocean so it must come from the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that we have to do is follow it and sooner or later we shall come upon its source <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were already rather close in but i ordered the us prow turned inshore and we crept slowly along constantly dipping up the water and tasting it to assure ourselves that we didnt get outside the freshwater current <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a very light offshore wind and scarcely any breakers so that the approach to the shore was continued without finding bottom yet though we were already quite close we saw no indication of any indention in the coast from which even a tiny brooklet might issue and certainly no mouth of a large river such as this must necessarily be to freshen the ocean even two hundred yards from shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tide was running out and this together with the strong flow of the freshwater current would have prevented our going against the cliffs even had we not been under power as it was we had to buck the combined forces in order to hold our position at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we came up to within twentyfive feet of the sheer wall which loomed high above us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no break in its forbidding face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we watched the face of the waters and searched the cliffs high face olson suggested that the fresh water might come from a submarine geyser <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this he said would account for its heat but even as he spoke a bush covered thickly with leaves and flowers bubbled to the surface and floated off astern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flowering shrubs dont thrive in the subterranean caverns from which geysers spring suggested bradley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i pointed at the base of the cliff ahead of us which the receding tide was gradually exposing to our view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all looked and all saw what i had seenthe top of a dark opening in the rock through which water was pouring out into the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the subterranean channel of an inland river i cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it flows through a land covered with vegetationand therefore a land upon which the sun shines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no subterranean caverns produce any order of plant life even remotely resembling what we have seen disgorged by this river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond those cliffs lie fertile lands and fresh waterperhaps game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yis sir said olson behoind the cliffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye spoke a true word sirbehoind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bradley laugheda rather sorry laugh though <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might as well call our attention to the fact sir he said that science has indicated that there is fresh water and vegetation on mars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a uboat isnt constructed to navigate space but it is designed to travel below the surface of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd be after sailin into that blank pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we havent one chance for life in a hundred thousand if we dont find food and water upon caprona <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this water coming out of the cliff is not salt but neither is it fit to drink though each of us has drunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is fair to assume that inland the river is fed by pure streams that there are fruits and herbs and game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall we lie out here and die of thirst and starvation with a land of plenty possibly only a few hundred yards away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have the means for navigating a subterranean river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are we too cowardly to utilize this means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be afther goin to it said olson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im willing to see it through agreed bradley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then under the bottom wi the best o luck an give em hell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried a young fellow who had been in the trenches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i commanded and in less than a minute the deck was deserted the conningtower covers had slammed to and the u was submergingpossibly for the last time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know that i had this feeling and i think that most of the others did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we went down i sat in the tower with the searchlight projecting its seemingly feeble rays ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we submerged very slowly and without headway more than sufficient to keep her nose in the right direction and as we went down i saw outlined ahead of us the black opening in the great cliff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an opening that would have admitted a halfdozen uboats at one and the same time roughly cylindrical in contourand dark as the pit of perdition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i gave the command which sent the u slowly ahead i could not but feel a certain uncanny presentiment of evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what lay at the end of this great sewer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had we bidden farewell forever to the sunlight and life or were there before us dangers even greater than those which we now faced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried to keep my mind from vain imagining by calling everything which i observed to the eager ears below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was the eyes of the whole company and i did my best not to fail them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had advanced a hundred yards perhaps when our first danger confronted us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just ahead was a sharp rightangle turn in the tunnel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see the rivers flotsam hurtling against the rocky wall upon the left as it was driven on by the mighty current and i feared for the safety of the u in making so sharp a turn under such adverse conditions but there was nothing for it but to try <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt warn my fellows of the dangerit could have but caused them useless apprehension for if we were to be smashed against the rocky wall no power on earth could avert the quick end that would come to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave the command full speed ahead and went charging toward the menace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was forced to approach the dangerous lefthand wall in order to make the turn and i depended upon the power of the motors to carry us through the surging waters in safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well we made it but it was a narrow squeak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we swung around the full force of the current caught us and drove the stern against the rocks there was a thud which sent a tremor through the whole craft and then a moment of nasty grinding as the steel hull scraped the rock wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i expected momentarily the inrush of waters that would seal our doom but presently from below came the welcome word that all was well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in another fifty yards there was a second turn this time toward the left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was more of a gentle curve and we took it without trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that it was plain sailing though as far as i could know there might be most anything ahead of us and my nerves strained to the snappingpoint every instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the second turn the channel ran comparatively straight for between one hundred and fifty and two hundred yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the waters grew suddenly lighter and my spirits rose accordingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouted down to those below that i saw daylight ahead and a great shout of thanksgiving reverberated through the ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later we emerged into sunlit water and immediately i raised the periscope and looked about me upon the strangest landscape i had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in the middle of a broad and now sluggish river the banks of which were lined by giant arboraceous ferns raising their mighty fronds fifty one hundred two hundred feet into the quiet air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> close by us something rose to the surface of the river and dashed at the periscope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a vision of wide distended jaws and then all was blotted out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a shiver ran down into the tower as the thing closed upon the periscope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later it was gone and i could see again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above the trees there soared into my vision a huge thing on batlike wingsa creature large as a large whale but fashioned more after the order of a lizard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then again something charged the periscope and blotted out the mirror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will confess that i was almost gasping for breath as i gave the commands to emerge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into what sort of strange land had fate guided us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the instant the deck was awash i opened the conningtower hatch and stepped out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in another minute the deckhatch lifted and those who were not on duty below streamed up the ladder olson bringing nobs under one arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for several minutes no one spoke i think they must each have been as overcome by awe as was i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all about us was a flora and fauna as strange and wonderful to us as might have been those upon a distant planet had we suddenly been miraculously transported through ether to an unknown world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the grass upon the nearer bank was unearthlylush and high it grew and each blade bore upon its tip a brilliant flower violet or yellow or carmine or bluemaking as gorgeous a sward as human imagination might conceive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tall fernlike trees were alive with monkeys snakes and lizards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huge insects hummed and buzzed hither and thither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mighty forms could be seen moving upon the ground in the thick forest while the bosom of the river wriggled with living things and above flapped the wings of gigantic creatures such as we are taught have been extinct throughout countless ages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you look at the giraffe comin up out o the bottom of the say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we looked in the direction he pointed and saw a long glossy neck surmounted by a small head rising above the surface of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the back of the creature was exposed brown and glossy as the water dripped from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it turned its eyes upon us opened its lizardlike mouth emitted a shrill hiss and came for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing must have been sixteen or eighteen feet in length and closely resembled pictures i had seen of restored plesiosaurs of the lower jurassic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it charged us as savagely as a mad bull and one would have thought it intended to destroy and devour the mighty uboat as i verily believe it did intend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were moving slowly up the river as the creature bore down upon us with distended jaws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the long neck was far outstretched and the four flippers with which it swam were working with powerful strokes carrying it forward at a rapid pace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it reached the crafts side the jaws closed upon one of the stanchions of the deck rail and tore it from its socket as though it had been a toothpick stuck in putty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this exhibition of titanic strength i think we all simultaneously stepped backward and bradley drew his revolver and fired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bullet struck the thing in the neck just above its body but instead of disabling it merely increased its rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its hissing rose to a shrill scream as it raised half its body out of water onto the sloping sides of the hull of the u and endeavored to scramble upon the deck to devour us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dozen shots rang out as we who were armed drew our pistols and fired at the thing but though struck several times it showed no signs of succumbing and only floundered farther aboard the submarine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had noticed that the girl had come on deck and was standing not far behind me and when i saw the danger to which we were all exposed i turned and forced her toward the hatch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had not spoken for some days and we did not speak now but she gave me a disdainful look which was quite as eloquent as words and broke loose from my grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw i could do nothing with her unless i exerted force and so i turned with my back toward her that i might be in a position to shield her from the strange reptile should it really succeed in reaching the deck and as i did so i saw the thing raise one flipper over the rail dart its head forward and with the quickness of lightning seize upon one of the boches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ran forward discharging my pistol into the creatures body in an effort to force it to relinquish its prey but i might as profitably have shot at the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shrieking and screaming the german was dragged from the deck and the moment the reptile was clear of the boat it dived beneath the surface of the water with its terrified prey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we were all more or less shaken by the frightfulness o the tragedyuntil olson remarked that the balance of power now rested where it belonged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> following the death of benson we had been nine and ninenine germans and nine allies as we called ourselves now there were but eight germans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we never counted the girl on either side i suppose because she was a girl though we knew well enough now that she was ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so olsons remark helped to clear the atmosphere for the allies at least and then our attention was once more directed toward the river for around us there had sprung up a perfect bedlam of screams and hisses and a seething caldron of hideous reptiles devoid of fear and filled only with hunger and with rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they clambered squirmed and wriggled to the deck forcing us steadily backward though we emptied our pistols into them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were all sorts and conditions of horrible thingshuge hideous grotesque monstrousa veritable mesozoic nightmare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw that the girl was gotten below as quickly as possible and she took nobs with herpoor nobs had nearly barked his head off and i think too that for the first time since his littlest puppyhood he had known fear nor can i blame him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the girl i sent bradley and most of the allies and then the germans who were on deckvon schoenvorts being still in irons below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the creatures were approaching perilously close before i dropped through the hatchway and slammed down the cover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i went into the tower and ordered full speed ahead hoping to distance the fearsome things but it was useless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only could any of them easily outdistance the u but the further upstream we progressed the greater the number of our besiegers until fearful of navigating a strange river at high speed i gave orders to reduce and moved slowly and majestically through the plunging hissing mass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was mighty glad that our entrance into the interior of caprona had been inside a submarine rather than in any other form of vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could readily understand how it might have been that caprona had been invaded in the past by venturesome navigators without word of it ever reaching the outside world for i can assure you that only by submarine could man pass up that great sluggish river alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we proceeded up the river for some forty miles before darkness overtook us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was afraid to submerge and lie on the bottom overnight for fear that the mud might be deep enough to hold us and as we could not hold with the anchor i ran in close to shore and in a brief interim of attack from the reptiles we made fast to a large tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we also dipped up some of the river water and found it though quite warm a little sweeter than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had food enough and with the water we were all quite refreshed but we missed fresh meat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been weeks now since we had tasted it and the sight of the reptiles gave me an ideathat a steak or two from one of them might not be bad eating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i went on deck with a rifle twenty of which were aboard the u <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sight of me a huge thing charged and climbed to the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i retreated to the top of the conningtower and when it had raised its mighty bulk to the level of the little deck on which i stood i let it have a bullet right between the eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing stopped then and looked at me a moment as much as to say why this thing has a stinger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then it reached out its long neck and opened its mighty jaws and grabbed for me but i wasnt there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had tumbled backward into the tower and i mighty near killed myself doing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i glanced up that little head on the end of its long neck was coming straight down on top of me and once more i tumbled into greater safety sprawling upon the floor of the centrale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olson was looking up and seeing what was poking about in the tower ran for an ax nor did he hesitate a moment when he returned with one but sprang up the ladder and commenced chopping away at that hideous face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing didnt have sufficient brainpan to entertain more than a single idea at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though chopped and hacked and with a bullethole between its eyes it still persisted madly in its attempt to get inside the tower and devour olson though its body was many times the diameter of the hatch nor did it cease its efforts until after olson had succeeded in decapitating it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the two men went on deck through the main hatch and while one kept watch the other cut a hind quarter off plesiosaurus olsoni as bradley dubbed the thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime olson cut off the long neck saying that it would make fine soup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time we had cleared away the blood and refuse in the tower the cook had juicy steaks and a steaming broth upon the electric stove and the aroma arising from p <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olsoni filled us an with a hitherto unfelt admiration for him and all his kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the steaks we had that night and they were fine and the following morning we tasted the broth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed odd to be eating a creature that should by all the laws of paleontology have been extinct for several million years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it gave one a feeling of newness that was almost embarrassing although it didnt seem to embarrass our appetites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olson ate until i thought he would burst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl ate with us that night at the little officers mess just back of the torpedo compartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the narrow table was unfolded the four stools were set out and for the first time in days we sat down to eat and for the first time in weeks we had something to eat other than the monotony of the short rations of an impoverished uboat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobs sat between the girl and me and was fed with morsels of the plesiosaurus steak at the risk of forever contaminating his manners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked at me sheepishly all the time for he knew that no wellbred dog should eat at table but the poor fellow was so wasted from improper food that i couldnt enjoy my own meal had he been denied an immediate share in it and anyway lys wanted to feed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lys was coldly polite to me and sweetly gracious to bradley and olson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wasnt of the gushing type i knew so i didnt expect much from her and was duly grateful for the few morsels of attention she threw upon the floor to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had a pleasant meal with only one unfortunate occurrencewhen olson suggested that possibly the creature we were eating was the same one that ate the german <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was some time before we could persuade the girl to continue her meal but at last bradley prevailed upon her pointing out that we had come upstream nearly forty miles since the boche had been seized and that during that time we had seen literally thousands of these denizens of the river indicating that the chances were very remote that this was the same plesiosaur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and anyway he concluded it was only a scheme of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olsons to get all the steaks for himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we discussed the future and ventured opinions as to what lay before us but we could only theorize at best for none of us knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the whole land was infested by these and similar horrid monsters life would be impossible upon it and we decided that we would only search long enough to find and take aboard fresh water and such meat and fruits as might be safely procurable and then retrace our way beneath the cliffs to the open sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so at last we turned into our narrow bunks hopeful happy and at peace with ourselves our lives and our god to awaken the following morning refreshed and still optimistic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had an easy time getting awayas we learned later because the saurians do not commence to feed until late in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from noon to midnight their curve of activity is at its height while from dawn to about nine oclock it is lowest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a matter of fact we didnt see one of them all the time we were getting under way though i had the cannon raised to the deck and manned against an assault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hoped but i was none too sure that shells might discourage them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trees were full of monkeys of all sizes and shades and once we thought we saw a manlike creature watching us from the depth of the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shortly after we resumed our course upstream we saw the mouth of another and smaller river emptying into the main channel from the souththat is upon our right and almost immediately after we came upon a large island five or six miles in length and at fifty miles there was a still larger river than the last coming in from the northwest the course of the main stream having now changed to northeast by southwest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water was quite free from reptiles and the vegetation upon the banks of the river had altered to more open and parklike forest with eucalyptus and acacia mingled with a scattering of tree ferns as though two distinct periods of geologic time had overlapped and merged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grass too was less flowering though there were still gorgeous patches mottling the greensward and lastly the fauna was less multitudinous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six or seven miles farther and the river widened considerably before us opened an expanse of water to the farther horizon and then we sailed out upon an inland sea so large that only a shore line upon our side was visible to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the waters all about us were alive with life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were still a few reptiles but there were fish by the thousands by the millions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water of the inland sea was very warm almost hot and the atmosphere was hot and heavy above it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed strange that beyond the buttressed walls of caprona icebergs floated and the south wind was biting for only a gentle breeze moved across the face of these living waters and that was damp and warm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gradually we commenced to divest ourselves of our clothing retaining only sufficient for modesty but the sun was not hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was more the heat of a steamroom than of an oven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we coasted up the shore of the lake in a northwesterly direction sounding all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found the lake deep and the bottom rocky and steeply shelving toward the center and once when i moved straight out from shore to take other soundings we could find no bottom whatsoever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in open spaces along the shore we caught occasional glimpses of the distant cliffs and here they appeared only a trifle less precipitous than those which bound caprona on the seaward side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my theory is that in a far distant era caprona was a mighty mountainperhaps the worlds mightiest volcanic action blew off the entire crest blew thousands of feet of the mountain upward and outward and onto the surrounding continent leaving a great crater and then possibly the continent sank as ancient continents have been known to do leaving only the summit of caprona above the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the encircling walls the central lake the hot springs which feed the lake all point to a conclusion and the fauna and the flora bear indisputable evidence that caprona was once part of some great landmass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we cruised up along the coast the landscape continued a more or less open forest with here and there a small plain where we saw animals grazing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with my glass i could make out a species of large red deer some antelope and what appeared to be a species of horse and once i saw the shaggy form of what might have been a monstrous bison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there seemed little danger of starving upon caprona <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the game however seemed wary for the instant the animals discovered us they threw up their heads and tails and went cavorting off those farther inland following the example of the others until all were lost in the mazes of the distant forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the great shaggy ox stood his ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with lowered head he watched us until we had passed and then continued feeding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about twenty miles up the coast from the mouth of the river we encountered low cliffs of sandstone broken and tortured evidence of the great upheaval which had torn caprona asunder in the past intermingling upon a common level the rock formations of widely separated eras fusing some and leaving others untouched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we ran along beside them for a matter of ten miles arriving off a broad cleft which led into what appeared to be another lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we were in search of pure water we did not wish to overlook any portion of the coast and so after sounding and finding that we had ample depth i ran the u between headlands into as pretty a landlocked harbor as sailormen could care to see with good water right up to within a few yards of the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we cruised slowly along two of the boches again saw what they believed to be a man or manlike creature watching us from a fringe of trees a hundred yards inland and shortly after we discovered the mouth of a small stream emptying into the bay it was the first stream we had found since leaving the river and i at once made preparations to test its water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to land it would be necessary to run the u close in to the shore at least as close as we could for even these waters were infested though not so thickly by savage reptiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ordered sufficient water let into the divingtanks to lower us about a foot and then i ran the bow slowly toward the shore confident that should we run aground we still had sufficient lifting force to free us when the water should be pumped out of the tanks but the bow nosed its way gently into the reeds and touched the shore with the keel still clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my men were all armed now with both rifles and pistols each having plenty of ammunition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ordered one of the germans ashore with a line and sent two of my own men to guard him for from what little we had seen of caprona or caspak as we learned later to call the interior we realized that any instant some new and terrible danger might confront us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the line was made fast to a small tree and at the same time i had the stern anchor dropped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as the boche and his guard were aboard again i called all hands on deck including von schoenvorts and there i explained to them that the time had come for us to enter into some sort of an agreement among ourselves that would relieve us of the annoyance and embarrassment of being divided into two antagonistic partsprisoners and captors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told them that it was obvious our very existence depended upon our unity of action that we were to all intent and purpose entering a new world as far from the seat and causes of our own worldwar as if millions of miles of space and eons of time separated us from our past lives and habitations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no reason why we should carry our racial and political hatreds into caprona i insisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the germans among us might kill all the english or the english might kill the last german without affecting in the slightest degree either the outcome of even the smallest skirmish upon the western front or the opinion of a single individual in any belligerent or neutral country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i therefore put the issue squarely to you all shall we bury our animosities and work together with and for one another while we remain upon caprona or must we continue thus divided and but half armed possibly until death has claimed the last of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and let me tell you if you have not already realized it the chances are a thousand to one that not one of us ever will see the outside world again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are safe now in the matter of food and water we could provision the u for a long cruise but we are practically out of fuel and without fuel we cannot hope to reach the ocean as only a submarine can pass through the barrier cliffs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he eyed me in that disagreeable way of his and demanded to know in case they accepted my suggestion what their status would be in event of our finding a way to escape with the u <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i replied that i felt that if we had all worked loyally together we should leave caprona upon a common footing and to that end i suggested that should the remote possibility of our escape in the submarine develop into reality we should then immediately make for the nearest neutral port and give ourselves into the hands of the authorities when we should all probably be interned for the duration of the war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to my surprise he agreed that this was fair and told me that they would accept my conditions and that i could depend upon their loyalty to the common cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thanked him and then addressed each one of his men individually and each gave me his word that he would abide by all that i had outlined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was further understood that we were to act as a military organization under military rules and disciplinei as commander with bradley as my first lieutenant and olson as my second in command of the englishmen while von schoenvorts was to act as an additional second lieutenant and have charge of his own men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the four of us were to constitute a military court under which men might be tried and sentenced to punishment for infraction of military rules and discipline even to the passing of the deathsentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then had arms and ammunition issued to the germans and leaving bradley and five men to guard the u the balance of us went ashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing we did was to taste the water of the little stream which to our delight we found sweet pure and cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this stream was entirely free from dangerous reptiles because as i later discovered they became immediately dormant when subjected to a much lower temperature than degrees fahrenheit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dislike cold water and keep as far away from it as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were countless brooktrout here and deep holes that invited us to bathe and along the bank of the stream were trees bearing a close resemblance to ash and beech and oak their characteristics evidently induced by the lower temperature of the air above the cold water and by the fact that their roots were watered by the water from the stream rather than from the warm springs which we afterward found in such abundance elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our first concern was to fill the water tanks of the u with fresh water and that having been accomplished we set out to hunt for game and explore inland for a short distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olson von schoenvorts two englishmen and two germans accompanied me leaving ten to guard the ship and the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had intended leaving nobs behind but he got away and joined me and was so happy over it that i hadnt the heart to send him back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we followed the stream upward through a beautiful country for about five miles and then came upon its source in a little boulderstrewn clearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from among the rocks bubbled fully twenty icecold springs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> north of the clearing rose sandstone cliffs to a height of some fifty to seventyfive feet with tall trees growing at their base and almost concealing them from our view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the west the country was flat and sparsely wooded and here it was that we saw our first gamea large red deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was grazing away from us and had not seen us when one of my men called my attention to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> motioning for silence and having the rest of the party lie down i crept toward the quarry accompanied only by whitely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got within a hundred yards of the deer when he suddenly raised his antlered head and pricked up his great ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we both fired at once and had the satisfaction of seeing the buck drop then we ran forward to finish him with our knives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deer lay in a small open space close to a clump of acacias and we had advanced to within several yards of our kill when we both halted suddenly and simultaneously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whitely looked at me and i looked at whitely and then we both looked back in the direction of the deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looks to me whitely like an error i said some assistant god who had been creating elephants must have been temporarily transferred to the lizarddepartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you refused last summer when i asked you to let me go up to grenfells mission on the labrador <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could go now at least as far as the newfoundland station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think it is an exceedingly foolish enterprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would interrupt the career that i have marked out for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then heres a cheaper proposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> algy vanderhoof wants me to join him on his yacht withwell with a little partyto cruise in the west indies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vanderhoof set is wild and godlessi do not wish to see you keeping company with fools who walk in the broad and easy way that leads to perdition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is rather a hard choice said the young man with a short laugh turning toward the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to you theres very little differencea fools paradise or a fools hell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its one or the other for me and ill toss up for it tonight heads i lose tails the devil wins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyway im sick of this and im out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harold said the older man and there was a slight tremor in his voice dont let us quarrel on christmas eve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all i want is to persuade you to think seriously of the duties and responsibilities to which god has called youdont speak lightly of heaven and hellremember there is another life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man came back and laid his hand upon his fathers shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father he said i want to remember it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i try to believe in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but somehow or other in this house it all seems unreal to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt all you say is perfectly right and wise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont venture to argue against it but i cant feel itthats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if im to have a soul either to lose or to save i must really live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just now neither the present nor the future means anything to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im very grateful to you and well part friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the father held out his hand in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heavy portiere dropped noiselessly behind the son and he went up the wide curving stairway to his own room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime john weightman sat in his carved chair in the jacobean diningroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt strangely old and dull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the portraits of beautiful women by lawrence and reynolds and raeburn which had often he fancied something cold and almost unfriendly in their expression as if they were staring through him or beyond him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they cared nothing for his principles his hopes his disappointments his successes they belonged to another world in which he had no place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this he felt a vague resentment a sense of discomfort that he could not have defined or explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was used to being considered respected appreciated at his full value in every region even in that of his own dreams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently he rang for the butler telling him to close the house and not to sit up and walked with lagging steps into the long library where the shaded lamps were burning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eye fell upon the low shelves full of costly books but he had no desire to open them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the carefully chosen pictures that hung above them seemed to have lost their attraction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused for a moment before an idyll of corota dance of nymphs around some forgotten altar in a vaporous gladeand looked at it curiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something rapturous and serene about the picture a breath of springtime in the misty trees a harmony of joy in the dancing figures that wakened in him a feeling of halfpleasure and halfenvy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it represented something that he had never known in his calculated orderly life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was dimly mistrustful of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is certainly very beautiful he thought but it is distinctly pagan that altar is built to some heathen god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it does not fit into the scheme of a christian life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i doubt whether it is consistent with three or four times what i paid for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was a good purchase a very good bargain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was covered with pamphlets and reports of the various enterprises in which he was interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a pile of newspaper clippings in which his name was mentioned with praise for his sustaining power as a pillar of finance for his judicious benevolence for his support of wise and prudent reform movements for his discretion in making permanent public giftsthe weightman charities one very complaisant editor called them as if they deserved classification as a distinct species <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a picture of the weightman wing of the hospital for cripples the weightman chair of political jurisprudence in jackson university of which he was a trustee and an illustrated account of the opening of the weightman grammarschool at dulwichonthesound where he had his legal residence for purposes of taxation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this last was perhaps the most carefully planned of all the weightman charities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he desired to win the confidence and support of his rural neighbors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had pleased him much when the local newspaper had spoken of him as an ideal citizen and the logical candidate for the governorship of the state but upon the whole it seemed to him wiser to keep out of active politics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be easier and better to put harold into the running to have him sent to the legislature from the dulwich district then to the national house then to the senate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the weightman interests were large enough to need a direct representative and guardian at washington <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tonight all these plans came back to him with dust upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were dry and crumbling like forsaken habitations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the son upon whom his complacent ambition had rested had turned his back upon the family would be secure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the zest of it all would be gone if john weightman had to give up the assurance of perpetuating his name and his principles in his son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a bitter disappointment and he felt that he had not deserved it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rose from the chair and paced the room with leaden feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time in his life his age was visibly upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his head was heavy and hot and the thoughts that rolled in it were confused and depressing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could it be that he had made a mistake in the principles of his existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no argument in what harold had saidit was almost childishand yet it had shaken the elder man more deeply than he cared to show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it held a silent attack which touched him more than open criticism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose the end of his life were nearer than he thoughtthe end must come some timewhat if it were now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he not was he not touching the law blameless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beyond this even if there were some faults in his characterand all men are sinners yet he surely believed in the saving doctrines of religionthe forgiveness of sins the resurrection of the body the life everlasting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes that was the true source of comfort after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would read a bit in the bible as he did every night and go to bed and to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went back to his chair at the library table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a strange weight of weariness rested upon him but he opened the book at a familiar place and his eyes fell upon the verse at the bottom of the page <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that had been the text of the sermon a few weeks before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sleepily heavily he tried to fix his mind upon it and recall it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mistake to pause here in reading the verse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must read on without a pauselay not up treasures upon earth where moth and rust do corrupt and where thieves break through and stealthat was the true doctrine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we may have treasures upon earth but they must not be put into he had always followed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moths and rust and thieves had done no harm to his investments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john weightmans drooping eyes turned to the next verse at the top of the second column <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now what had the doctor said about that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how was it to be understoodin what sensetreasuresin heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the book seemed to float away from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered dimly if this could be death coming so suddenly so quietly so irresistibly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he struggled for a moment to hold himself up and then sank slowly forward upon the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his head rested upon his folded hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long afterward conscious life returned to him he did not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blank might have been an hour or a century <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew only that omething had happened in the interval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is was he could not tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found great difficulty in catching the thread of his identity again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt that he was himself but the trouble was to make his connections to verify and place himself to know who and where he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john weightman was sitting on a stone not far from a road in a strange land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the road was not a formal highway fenced and graded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was more like a great traveltrace worn by thousands of feet passing across the open country in the same direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down in the valley into which he could look the road seemed to form itself gradually out of many minor paths little footways coming across the meadows winding tracks following along beside the streams faintly marked trails emerging from the woodlands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baron uttered a single dreadful groan and expired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the murderess quitted her bed hastily took a lamp in one hand in the other the bloody dagger and bent her course towards the cavern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the porter dared not to refuse opening the gates to one more dreaded in the castle than its master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beatrice reached lindenberg hole unopposed where according to promise she found otto waiting for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he received and listened to her narrative with transport but ere she had time to ask why he came unaccompanied he convinced her that he wished for no witnesses to their interview <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anxious to conceal his share in the murder and to free himself from a woman whose violent and atrocious character made him tremble with reason for his own safety he had resolved on the destruction of his wretched agent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rushing upon her suddenly he wrested the dagger from her hand he plunged it still reeking with his brothers blood in her bosom and put an end to her existence by repeated blows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> otto now succeeded to the barony of lindenberg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the murder was attributed solely to the fugitive nun and no one suspected him to have persuaded her to the action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but though his crime was unpunished by man gods justice permitted him not to enjoy in peace his bloodstained honours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her bones lying still unburied in the cave the restless soul of beatrice continued to inhabit the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drest in her religious habit in memory of her vows broken to heaven furnished with the dagger which had drank the blood of her paramour and holding the lamp which had guided her flying steps every night did she stand before the bed of otto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most dreadful confusion reigned through the castle the vaulted chambers resounded with shrieks and groans and the spectre as she ranged along the antique galleries uttered an incoherent mixture of prayers and blasphemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> otto was unable to withstand the shock which he felt at this fearful vision its horror increased with every succeeding appearance his alarm at length became so insupportable that his heart burst and one morning he was found in his bed totally deprived of warmth and animation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his death did not put an end to the nocturnal riots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bones of beatrice continued to lie unburied and her ghost continued to haunt the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the domains of lindenberg now fell to a distant relation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but terrified by the accounts given him of the bleeding nun so was the spectre called by the multitude the new baron called to his assistance a celebrated exorciser <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this holy man succeeded in obliging her to temporary repose but though she discovered to him her history he was not permitted to reveal it to others or cause her skeleton to be removed to hallowed ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that office was reserved for you and till your coming her ghost was doomed to wander about the castle and lament the crime which she had there committed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however the exorciser obliged her to silence during his lifetime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so long as he existed the haunted chamber was shut up and the spectre was invisible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at his death which happened in five years after she again appeared but only once on every fifth year on the same day and at the same hour when she plunged her knife in the heart of her sleeping lover she then visited the cavern which held her mouldering skeleton returned to the castle as soon as the clock struck two and was seen no more till the next five years had elapsed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was doomed to suffer during the space of a century <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing now remains but to consign to the grave the ashes of beatrice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been the means of releasing you from your visionary tormentor and amidst all the sorrows which oppress me to think that i have been of use to you is some consolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may the ghost of your relation enjoy that rest in the tomb which the almightys vengeance has here the stranger prepared to quit the apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i you have satisfied my curiosity with regard to the spectre but you leave me in prey to yet greater respecting yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deign to inform me to whom i am under such real obligations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mention circumstances long past and persons long dead you were personally acquainted with the exorciser who by your own account has been deceased near a century <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how am i to account for this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what means that burning cross upon your forehead and why did the sight of it strike on these points he for some time refused to satisfy me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length overcome by my entreaties he consented to clear up the whole on condition that i would defer his explanation till the next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this request i was obliged to comply and he left me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning my first care was to enquire after the mysterious stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conceive my disappointment when informed that he had already quitted ratisbon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dispatched messengers in pursuit of him but in vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no traces of the fugitive were discovered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since that moment i never have heard any more of lorenzo here interrupted his friends narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he you have never discovered who he was or even pardon me replied the marquis when i related this adventure to my uncle the cardinalduke he told me that he had no doubt of this singular mans being the celebrated character known universally by the name of the wandering jew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his not being permitted to pass more than fourteen days on the same spot the burning cross impressed upon his forehead the effect which it produced upon the beholders and many other circumstances give this supposition the colour of truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cardinal is fully persuaded of it and for my own part i am inclined to adopt the only solution which offers itself to this riddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i return to from this period i recovered my health so rapidly as to astonish my physicians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bleeding nun appeared no more and i was soon able to set out for lindenberg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baron received me with open arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i confided to him the sequel of my adventure and he was not a little pleased to find that his mansion would be no longer troubled with the phantoms quiennial visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sorry to perceive that absence had not weakened donna rodolphas imprudent passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a private conversation which i had with her during my short stay at the castle she renewed her attempts to persuade me to return her affection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> regarding her as the primary cause of all my sufferings i entertained for her no other sentiment than disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the skeleton of beatrice was found in the place which she had mentioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this being all that i sought at lindenberg i hastened to quit the barons domains equally anxious to perform the obsequies of the murdered nun and escape the importunity of a woman whom i detested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i departed followed by donna rodolphas menaces that my contempt should not be long unpunished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i now bent my course towards spain with all diligence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucas with my baggage had joined me during my abode at lindenberg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i arrived in my native country without any accident and immediately proceeded to my fathers castle in andalusia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the remains of beatrice were deposited in the family vault all due ceremonies performed and the number of masses said which she had required <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing now hindered me from employing all my endeavours to discover the retreat of agnes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baroness had assured me that her niece had already taken the veil this intelligence i suspected to have been forged by jealousy and hoped to find my mistress still at liberty to accept my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i enquired after her family i found that before her daughter could reach madrid donna inesilla was no more you my dear lorenzo were said to be abroad but where i could not discover your father was in a distant province on a visit to the duke de medina and as to agnes no one could or would inform me what was become of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theodore according to promise had returned to strasbourg where he found his grandfather dead and marguerite in possession of his fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all her persuations to remain with her were fruitless he quitted her a second time and followed me to madrid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exerted himself to the utmost in forwarding my search but our united endeavours were unattended by success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the retreat which concealed agnes remained an impenetrable mystery and i began to abandon all hopes of recovering her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about eight months ago i was returning to my hotel in a melancholy humour having past the evening at the playhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was dark and i was unaccompanied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> plunged in reflections which were far from being agreeable i perceived not that three men had followed me from the theatre till on turning into an unfrequented street they all attacked me at the same time with the utmost fury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sprang back a few paces drew my sword and threw my cloak over my left arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the obscurity of the night was in my favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the most part the blows of the assassins being aimed at random failed to touch me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i at length was fortunate enough to lay one of my adversaries at my feet but before this i had already received so many wounds and was so warmly pressed that my destruction would have been inevitable had not the clashing of swords called a cavalier to my assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ran towards me with his sword drawn several domestics followed him with torches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his arrival made the combat equal yet would not the bravoes abandon their design till the servants were on the point of joining us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they then fled away and we lost them in the obscurity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stranger now addressed himself to me with politeness and enquired whether i was wounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faint with the loss of blood i could scarcely thank him for his seasonable aid and entreat him to let some of his servants convey me to the hotel de las cisternas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i no sooner mentioned the name than he profest himself an acquaintance of my fathers and declared that he would not permit my being transported to such a distance before my wounds had been examined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added that his house was hard by and begged me to accompany him thither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his manner was so earnest that i could not reject his offer and leaning upon his arm a few minutes brought me to the porch of a magnificent hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on entering the house an old greyheaded domestic came to welcome my conductor he enquired when the duke his master meant to quit the country and was answered that he would remain there yet some months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my deliverer then desired the family surgeon to be summoned without delay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was seated upon a sopha in a noble apartment and my wounds being examined they were declared to be very slight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon however advised me not to expose myself to the night air and the stranger pressed me so earnestly to take a bed in his house that i consented to remain where i was for the present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being now left alone with my deliverer i took the opportunity of thanking him in more express terms than i had done hitherto but he begged me to be silent upon the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i esteem myself happy said he in having had it in my power to render you this little service and i shall think myself eternally obliged to my daughter for detaining me so late at the convent of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the high esteem in which i have ever held the marquis de las cisternas though accident has not permitted our being so intimate as i could wish makes me rejoice in the opportunity of making his sons acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am certain that my brother in whose house you now are will lament his not being at madrid to receive you himself but in the dukes absence i am master of the family and may assure you in his name that every conceive my surprize lorenzo at discovering in the person of my preserver don gaston de medina it was only to be equalled by my secret satisfaction at the assurance that agnes inhabited the convent of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this latter sensation was not a little weakened when in answer to my seemingly indifferent questions he told me that his daughter had really taken the veil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suffered not my grief at this circumstance to take root in my mind i flattered myself with the idea that my uncles credit at the court of rome would remove this obstacle and that without difficulty i should obtain for my mistress a dispensation from her vows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buoyed up with this hope i calmed the uneasiness of my bosom and i redoubled my endeavours to appear grateful for the attention and pleased with the society of don gaston <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a domestic now entered the room and informed me that the bravo whom i had wounded discovered some signs of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i desired that he might be carried to my fathers hotel and that as soon as he recovered his voice i would examine him respecting his reasons for attempting my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was answered that he was already able to speak though with difficulty don gastons curiosity made him press me to interrogate the assassin in his presence but this curiosity i was by no means inclined to gratify <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one reason was that doubting from whence the blow came i was unwilling to place before don gastons eyes the guilt of a sister another was that i feared to be recognized for alphonso dalvarada and precautions taken in consequence to keep me from the sight of agnes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to avow my passion for his daughter and endeavour to make him enter into my schemes what i knew of don gastons character convinced me would be an imprudent step and considering it to be essential that he should know me for no other than the conde de las cisternas i was determined not to let him hear the bravos confession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i insinuated to him that as i suspected a lady to be concerned in the business whose name might accidentally escape from the assassin it was necessary for me to examine the man in private <end> <end> 
<start> <start> don gastons delicacy would not permit his urging the point any longer and in consequence the bravo was conveyed to my hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning i took leave of my host who was to return to the duke on the same day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wounds had been so trifling that except being obliged to wear my arm in a sling for a short time i felt no inconvenience from the nights adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon who examined the bravos wound declared it to be mortal he had just time to confess that he had been instigated to murder me by the revengeful donna rodolpha and expired in a few minutes after <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all my thoughts were now bent upon getting to the speech of my lovely nun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theodore set himself to work and for this time with better success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he attacked the gardener of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare so forcibly with bribes and promises that the old man was entirely gained over to my interests and it was settled that i should be introduced into the convent in the character of his assistant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plan was put into execution without delay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> disguised in a common habit and a black patch covering one of my eyes i was presented to the lady prioress who condescended to approve of the gardeners choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i immediately entered upon my employment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> botany having been a favourite study with me i was by no means at a loss in my new station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some days i continued to work in the convent garden without meeting the object of my disguise on the fourth morning i was more successful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard the voice of agnes and was speeding towards the sound when the sight of the domina stopped me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i drew back with caution and concealed myself behind a thick clump of trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prioress advanced and seated herself with agnes on a bench at no great distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard her in an angry tone blame her companions continual melancholy she told her that to weep the loss of any lover in her situation was a crime but that to weep the loss of a faithless one was folly and absurdity in the extreme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes replied in so low a voice that i could not distinguish her words but i perceived that she used terms of gentleness and submission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a young pensioner who informed the domina that she was waited for in the parlour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady rose kissed the cheek of agnes and retired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes spoke much to her in praise of somebody whom i could not make out but her auditor seemed highly delighted and interested by the conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nun showed her several letters the other perused them with evident pleasure obtained permission to copy them and withdrew for that purpose to my great satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner was she out of sight than i quitted my concealment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fearing to alarm my lovely mistress i drew near her gently intending to discover myself by degrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but who for a moment can deceive the eyes of love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she raised her head at my approach and recognised me in spite of my disguise at a single glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rose hastily from her seat with an exclamation of surprize and attempted to retire but i followed her detained her and entreated to be heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> persuaded of my falsehood she refused to listen to me and ordered me positively to quit the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was now my turn to refuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i protested that however dangerous might be the consequences i would not leave her till she had heard my justification <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assured her that she had been deceived by the artifices of her relations that i could convince her beyond the power of doubt that my passion had been pure and disinterested and i asked her what should induce me to seek her in the convent were i influenced by the selfish motives which my enemies had ascribed to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my prayers my arguments and vows not to quit her till she had promised to listen to me united to her fears lest the nuns should see me with her to her natural curiosity and to the effection which she still felt for me in spite of my supposed desertion at length prevailed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me that to grant my request at that moment was impossible but she engaged to be in the same spot at eleven that night and to converse with me for the last time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having obtained this promise i released her hand and she fled back with rapidity towards the convent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i communicated my success to my ally the old gardener he pointed out an hiding place where i might shelter myself till night without fear of a discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thither i betook myself at the hour when i ought to have retired with my supposed master and waited impatiently for the appointed time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chillness of the night was in my favour since it kept the other nuns confined to their cells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes alone was insensible of the inclemency of the air and before eleven joined me at the spot which had witnessed our former interview <end> <end> 
<start> <start> secure from interruption i related to her the true cause of my disappearing on the fatal fifth of may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was evidently much affected by my narrative when it was concluded she confessed the injustice of her suspicions and blamed herself for having taken the veil through despair at my ingratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now it is too late to repine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she added the die is thrown i have pronounced my vows and dedicated myself to the service of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sensible how ill i am calculated for a convent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my disgust at a monastic life increases daily ennui and discontent are my constant companions and i will not conceal from you that the passion which i formerly felt for one so near being my husband is not yet extinguished in my bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> insuperable barriers divide us from each other and i now exerted myself to prove that our union was not so impossible as she seemed to think it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i vaunted to her the cardinalduke of lermas influence at the court of rome i assured her that i should easily obtain a dispensation from her vows and i doubted not but don gaston would coincide with my views when informed of my real name and long attachment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes replied that since i encouraged such an hope i could know but little of her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> liberal and kind in every other respect superstition formed the only stain upon his character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon this head he was inflexible he sacrificed his dearest interests to his scruples and would consider it an insult to suppose him capable of authorising his daughter to break her vows to heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but suppose said i interrupting her suppose that he should disapprove of our union let him remain ignorant of my proceedings till i have rescued you from the prison in which you are now confined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once my wife you are free from his authority i need from him no pecuniary assistance and when he sees his resentment to be unavailing he will doubtless restore you to his favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but let the worst happen should don gaston be irreconcileable my relations will vie with each other in making you forget his loss and you will find in my father a don raymond replied agnes in a firm and resolute voice i love my father he has treated me harshly in this one instance but i have received from him in every other so many proofs of love that his affection is become necessary to my existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were i to quit the convent he never would forgive me nor can i think that on his deathbed he would leave me his curse without shuddering at the very idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides i am conscious myself that my vows are binding wilfully did i contract my engagement with heaven i cannot break it without a crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then banish from your mind the idea of our being ever united <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am devoted to religion and however i may grieve at our separation i would i strove to overrule these illgrounded scruples we were still disputing upon the subject when the convent bell summoned the nuns to matins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes was obliged to attend them but she left me not till i had compelled her to promise that on the following night she would be at the same place at the same hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these meetings continued for several weeks uninterrupted and tis now lorenzo that i must implore your indulgence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reflect upon our situation our youth our long attachment weigh all the circumstances which attended our assignations and you will confess the temptation to have been irresistible you will even pardon me when i acknowledge that in an unguarded moment the lorenzos eyes sparkled with fury a deep crimson spread itself over his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he started from his seat and attempted to draw his sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis was aware of his movement and caught his hand he pressed it affectionately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> till then restrain your passion and be at least convinced that if what i have related is criminal the blame must fall upon me and not lorenzo suffered himself to be prevailed upon by don raymonds entreaties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resumed his place and listened to the rest of the narrative with a gloomy and impatient countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scarcely was the first burst of passion past when agnes recovering herself started from my arms with horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she called me infamous seducer loaded me with the bitterest reproaches and beat her bosom in all the wildness of delirium <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ashamed of my imprudence i with difficulty found words to excuse myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i endeavoured to console her i threw myself at her feet and entreated her forgiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she forced her hand from me which i had taken and would have prest to my lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried with a violence which terrified me monster of perfidy and ingratitude how have i been deceived in you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked upon you as my friend my protector i trusted myself in your hands with confidence and relying upon your honour thought that mine ran no risque <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and tis by you whom i adored that i am covered with infamy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis by you that i have been seduced into breaking my vows to god that i am reduced to a level with the basest of my sex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shame upon you villain you she started from the bank on which she was seated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i endeavoured to detain her but she disengaged herself from me with violence and took refuge in the convent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i retired filled with confusion and inquietude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning i failed not as usual to appear in the garden but agnes was no where to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at night i waited for her at the place where we generally met i found no better success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several days and nights passed away in the same manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length i saw my offended mistress cross the walk on whose borders i was working she was accompanied by the same young pensioner on whose arm she seemed from weakness obliged to support herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked upon me for a moment but instantly turned her head away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i waited her return but she passed on to the convent without paying any attention to me or the penitent looks with which i implored her forgiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as the nuns were retired the old gardener joined me with a sorrowful air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> segnor said he it grieves me to say that i can be no longer of use to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady whom you used to meet has just assured me that if i admitted you again into the garden she would discover the whole business to the lady prioress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she bade me tell you also that your presence was an insult and that if you still possess the least respect for her you will never attempt to see her more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me then for informing you that i can favour your disguise no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should the prioress be acquainted with my conduct she might not be contented with dismissing me her service out of revenge she might accuse me of having profaned the convent and cause me to be thrown into the fruitless were my attempts to conquer his resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he denied me all future entrance into the garden and agnes persevered in neither letting me see or hear from her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in about a fortnight after a violent illness which had seized my father obliged me to set out for andalusia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hastened thither and as i imagined found the marquis at the point of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though on its first appearance his complaint was declared mortal he lingered out several months during which my attendance upon him during his malady and the occupation of settling his affairs after his decease permitted not my quitting andalusia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within these four days i returned to madrid and on arriving at my hotel i there found this letter waiting for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the marquis unlocked the drawer of a cabinet he took out a folded paper which he presented to his auditor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo opened it and recognised his sisters hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into what an abyss of misery have you plunged me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raymond you force me to become as criminal as yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had resolved never to see you more if possible to forget you if not only to remember you with hate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a being for whom i already feel a mothers tenderness solicits me to pardon my seducer and apply to his love for the means of preservation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raymond your child lives in my bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tremble at the vengeance of the prioress i tremble much for myself yet more for the innocent creature whose existence depends upon mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both of us are lost should my situation be discovered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> advise me then what steps to take but seek not to see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gardener who undertakes to deliver this is dismissed and we have nothing to hope from that quarter the man engaged in his place is of incorruptible fidelity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the best means of conveying to me your answer is by concealing it under the great statue of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis which stands in the capuchin cathedral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thither i go every thursday to confession and shall easily have an opportunity of securing your letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hear that you are now absent from madrid need i entreat you to write the very moment of your return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deceived by my nearest relations compelled to embrace a profession the duties of which i am illcalculated to perform conscious of the sanctity of those duties and seduced into violating them by one whom i least suspected of perfidy i am now obliged by circumstances to chuse between death and perjury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> womans timidity and maternal affection permit me not to balance in the choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel all the guilt into which i plunge myself when i yield to the plan which you before proposed to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my poor fathers death which has taken place since we met has removed one obstacle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sleeps in his grave and i no longer dread his anger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but from the anger of god oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who can protect me against my conscience against myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dare not dwell upon these thoughts they will drive me mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have taken my resolution procure a dispensation from my vows i am ready to fly with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me that absence has not abated your love tell me that you will rescue from death your unborn child and its unhappy mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i live in all the agonies of terror every eye which is fixed upon me seems to read my secret and my shame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you are the cause of those agonies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when my heart first loved you how little did it suspect you of making it feel such pangs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having perused the letter lorenzo restored it in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the excessive was my joy at reading this intelligence so earnestlydesired so little expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when don gaston discovered to me his daughters retreat i entertained no doubt of her readiness to quit the convent i had therefore entrusted the cardinalduke of lerma with the whole affair who immediately busied himself in obtaining the necessary bull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately i had afterwards neglected to stop his proceedings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not long since i received a letter from him stating that he expected daily to receive the order from the court of rome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon this i would willingly have relyed but the cardinal wrote me word that i must find some means of conveying agnes out of the convent unknown to the prioress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he doubted not but this latter would be much incensed by losing a person of such high rank from her society and consider the renunciation of agnes as an insult to her house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he represented her as a woman of a violent and revengeful character capable of proceeding to the greatest extremities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was therefore to be feared lest by confining agnes in the convent she should frustrate my hopes and render the popes mandate unavailing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> influenced by this consideration i resolved to carry off my mistress and conceal her till the arrival of the expected bull in the cardinaldukes estate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he approved of my design and profest himself ready to give a shelter to the fugitive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i next caused the new gardener of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare to be seized privately and confined in my hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this means i became master of the key to the garden door and i had now nothing more to do than prepare agnes for the elopement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was done by the letter which you saw me deliver this evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told her in it that i should be ready to receive her at twelve tomorrow night that i had secured the key of the garden and that she might depend upon a speedy release <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have now lorenzo heard the whole of my long narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have nothing to say in my excuse save that my intentions towards your sister have been ever the most honourable that it has always been and still is my design to make her my wife and that i trust when you consider these circumstances our youth and our attachment you will not only forgive our momentary lapse from virtue but will aid me in repairing my faults to agnes and o you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whom vanitys light bark conveys on fames mad voyage by the wind of praise with what a shifting gale your course you ply for ever sunk too low or borne too high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who pants for glory finds but short repose a breath revives him and a breath oerthrows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the marquis concluded his adventures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo before he could determine on his reply past some moments in reflection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> raymond said he taking his hand strict honour would oblige me to wash off in your blood the stain thrown upon my family but the circumstances of your case forbid me to consider you as an enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the temptation was too great to be resisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis the superstition of my relations which has occasioned these misfortunes and they are more the offenders than yourself and agnes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what has past between you cannot be recalled but may yet be repaired by uniting you to my sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have ever been you still continue to be my dearest and indeed my only friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel for agnes the truest affection and there is no one on whom i would bestow her more willingly than on yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will accompany you tomorrow night and conduct her myself to the house of the cardinal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my presence will be a sanction for her conduct and prevent her incurring blame by her the marquis thanked him in terms by no means deficient in gratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo then informed him that he had nothing more to apprehend from donna rodolphas enmity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five months had already elapsed since in an excess of passion she broke a bloodvessel and expired in the course of a few hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then proceeded to mention the interests of antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis was much surprized at hearing of this new relation his father had carried his hatred of elvira to the grave and had never given the least hint that he knew what was become of his eldest sons widow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> don raymond assured his friend that he was not mistaken in supposing him ready to acknowledge his sisterinlaw and her amiable daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the preparations for the elopement would not permit his visiting them the next day but in the meanwhile he desired lorenzo to assure them of his friendship and to supply elvira upon his account with any sums which she might want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this the youth promised to do as soon as her abode should be known to him he then took leave of his future brother and returned to the palace de medina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day was already on the point of breaking when the marquis retired to his chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conscious that his narrative would take up some hours and wishing to secure himself from interruption on returning to the hotel he ordered his attendants not to sit upfor him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> consequently he was somewhat surprised on entering his antiroom to find theodore established there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the page sat near a table with a pen in his hand and was so totally occupied by his employment that he perceived not his lords approach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis stopped to observe him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theodore wrote a few lines then paused and scratched out a part of the writing then wrote again smiled and seemed highly pleased with what he had been about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he threw down his pen sprang from his chair and clapped his hands together joyfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his transports were interrupted by a laugh from the marquis who suspected the nature of his employment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the youth started and looked round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he blushed ran to the table seized the paper on which he had been writing and concealed it in confusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lord i knew not that you were so near me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can i be of i shall follow his example when i have given my opinion of your nay i am sure that you have been writing some for nothing else could have kept you awake till this time of the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where theodores cheeks glowed with still deeper crimson he longed to show his poetry but first chose to be pressed for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not these verses which you just now declared to be so charming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come come let me see whether our opinions are the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i the boy produced his paper with seeming reluctance but the satisfaction which sparkled in his dark expressive eyes betrayed the vanity of his little bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis smiled while he observed the emotions of an heart as yet but little skilled in veiling its sentiments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seated himself upon a sopha theodore while hope and fear contended on his anxious countenance waited with inquietude for his masters decision while the marquis read the following lines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was dark the wind blew cold anacreon grown morose and old sat by his fire and fed the chearful flame sudden the cottagedoor expands and lo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before him cupid stands casts round a friendly glance and greets him by his name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the startled sire in sullen tone exclaimed while ire with crimson flushed his pale and wrinkled cheek wouldst thou again with amorous rage inflame my bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steeled by age vain boy to pierce my breast thine arrows are too weak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what seek you in this desart drear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no smiles or sports inhabit here neer did these vallies witness dalliance sweet eternal winter binds the plains age in my house despotic reigns my garden boasts no flower my bosom boasts no heat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> begone and seek the blooming bower where some ripe virgin courts thy power or bid provoking dreams flit round her bed on damons amorous breast repose wantonon chloes lip of rose or make her blushing cheek a pillow for thy head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be such thy haunts these regions cold avoid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor think grown wise and old this hoary head again thy yoke shall bear remembering that my fairest years by thee were marked with sighs and tears i think thy friendship false and shun the guileful snare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not yet forgot the pains i felt while bound in julias chains the ardent flames with which my bosom burned the nights i passed deprived of rest the jealous pangs which racked my breast my disappointed hopes and passion unreturned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then fly and curse mine eyes no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no day no hour no moment shalt thou stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know thy falsehood scorn thy arts distrust thy smiles and fear thy darts does age old man your wits confound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied the offended god and frowned his frown was sweet as is the virgins smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you to me these words address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to me who do not love you less though you my friendship scorn and pleasures past revile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if one proud fair you chanced to find an hundred other nymphs were kind whose smiles might well for julias frowns atone but such is man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his partial hand unnumbered favours writes on sand but stamps one little fault on solid lasting stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who led thee to the wave at noon where lesbia loved to lave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who named the bower alone where daphne lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and who when caelia shrieked for aid bad you with kisses hush the maid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what other wast than love oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you could call megentle boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you could prize me dearer than your soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could kiss and dance me on your knees and swear not wine itself would please had not the lip of love first touched the flowing bowl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> must those sweet days return no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> must i for aye your loss deplore banished your heart and from your favour driven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no my fears that smile denies that heaving breast those sparkling eyes declare me ever dear and all my faults forgiven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again beloved esteemed carest cupid shall in thine arms be prest sport on thy knees or on thy bosom sleep my torch thine agestruck heart shall warm my hand pale winters rage disarm a feather now of golden hue he smiling from his pinion drew this to the poets hand the boy commits and straight before anacreons eyes the fairest dreams of fancy rise and round his favoured head wild inspiration flits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his bosom glows with amorous fire eager he grasps the magic lyre swift oer the tuneful chords his fingers move the feather plucked from cupids wing sweeps the toolongneglected string while soft anacreon sings the power and praise of love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon as that name was heard the woods shook off their snows the melting floods broke their cold chains and winter fled away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more the earth was deckt with flowers mild zephyrs breathed through blooming bowers high towered the glorious sun and poured the blaze of day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> attracted by the harmonious sound sylvans and fauns the cot surround and curious crowd the minstrel to behold the woodnymphs haste the spell to prove eager they run they list they love and while they hear the strain forget the man is old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cupid to nothing constant long perched on the harp attends the song or stifles with a kiss the dulcet notes now on the poets breast reposes now twines his hoary locks with roses or borne on wings of gold in wanton circle floats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then thus anacreoni no more at other shrine my vows will pour since cupid deigns my numbers to inspire from phoebus or the blueeyed maid now shall my verse request no aid for love alone shall be the patron of my lyre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in lofty strain of earlier days i spread the kings or heros praise and struck the martial chords with epic fire but farewell hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your deeds my lips no more shall sing for love alone shall be the subject of my lyre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis returned the paper with a smile of encouragement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your little poem pleases me much said he however you must not count my opinion for anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am no judge of verses and for my own part never composed more than six lines in my life those six produced so unlucky an effect that i am fully resolved never to compose another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i wander from my subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was going to say that you cannot employ your time worse than in making verses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an author whether good or bad or between both is an animal whom everybody is privileged to attack for though all are not able to write books all conceive themselves able to judge them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a bad composition carries with it its own punishment contempt and ridicule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a good one excites envy and entails upon its author a thousand mortifications <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he finds himself assailed by partial and illhumoured criticism one man finds fault with the plan another with the style a third with the precept which it strives to inculcate and they who cannot succeed in finding fault with the book employ themselves in stigmatizing its author <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they maliciously rake out from obscurity every little circumstance which may throw ridicule upon his private character or conduct and aim at wounding the man since they cannot hurt the writer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short to enter the lists of literature is wilfully to expose yourself to the arrows of neglect ridicule envy and disappointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether you write well or ill be assured that you will not escape from blame indeed this circumstance contains a young authors chief consolation he remembers that lope de vega and calderona had unjust and envious critics and he modestly conceives himself to be exactly in their predicament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am conscious that all these sage observations are thrown away upon you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> authorship is a mania to conquer which no reasons are sufficiently strong and you might as easily persuade me not to love as i persuade you not to write <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however if you cannot help being occasionally seized with a poetical paroxysm take at least the precaution of communicating your verses to none but those whose partiality for then my lord you do not think these lines tolerable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said theodore with an humble and dejected air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i said before they have pleased me much but my regard for you makes me partial and others might judge them less favourably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must still remark that even my prejudice in your favour does not blind me so much as to prevent my observing several faults <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance you make a terrible confusion of metaphors you are too apt to make the strength of your lines consist more in the words than sense some of the verses only seem introduced in order to rhyme with others and most of the best ideas are borrowed from other poets though possibly you are unconscious of the theft yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these faults may occasionally be excused in a work of length but a short poem all this is true segnor but you should consider that i only your defects are the less excusable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their incorrectness may be forgiven in those who work for money who are obliged to compleat a given task in a given time and are paid according to the bulk not value of their productions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in those whom no necessity forces to turn author who merely write for fame and have full leisure to polish their compositions faults are impardonable the marquis rose from the sopha the page looked discouraged and melancholy and this did not escape his masters observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however added he smiling i think that these lines do you no discredit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your versification is tolerably easy and your ear seems to be just <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the perusal of your little poem upon the whole gave me much pleasure and if it is not asking too great a the youths countenance immediately cleared up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he perceived not the smile half approving half ironical which accompanied the request and he promised the copy with great readiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis withdrew to his chamber much amused by the instantaneous effect produced upon theodores vanity by the conclusion of his criticism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he threw himself upon his couch sleep soon stole over him and his dreams presented him with the most flattering pictures of happiness with agnes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on reaching the hotel de medina lorenzos first care was to enquire for letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found several waiting for him but that which he sought was not amongst them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leonella had found it impossible to write that evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however her impatience to secure don christovals heart on which she flattered herself with having made no slight impression permitted her not to pass another day without informing him where she was to be found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on her return from the capuchin church she had related to her sister with exultation how attentive an handsome cavalier had been to her as also how his companion had undertaken to plead antonias cause with the marquis de las cisternas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elvira received this intelligence with sensations very different from those with which it was communicated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she blamed her sisters imprudence in confiding her history to an absolute stranger and expressed her fears lest this inconsiderate step should prejudice the marquis against her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the greatest of her apprehensions she concealed in her own breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had observed with inquietude that at the mention of lorenzo a deep blush spread itself over her daughters cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the timid antonia dared not to pronounce his name without knowing wherefore she felt embarrassed when he was made the subject of discourse and endeavoured to change the conversation to ambrosio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elvira perceived the emotions of this young bosom in consequence she insisted upon leonellas breaking her promise to the cavaliers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sigh which on hearing this order escaped from antonia confirmed the wary mother in her resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through this resolution leonella was determined to break she conceived it to be inspired by envy and that her sister dreaded her being elevated above her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without imparting her design to anyone she took an opportunity of dispatching the following note to lorenzo it was delivered to him as soon as he woke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless segnor don lorenzo you have frequently accused me of ingratitude and forgetfulness but on the word of a virgin it was out of my power to perform my promise yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know not in what words to inform you how strange a reception my sister gave your kind wish to visit her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is an odd woman with many good points about her but her jealousy of me frequently makes her conceive notions quite unaccountable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on hearing that your friend had paid some little attention to me she immediately took the alarm she blamed my conduct and has absolutely forbidden me to let you know our abode <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my strong sense of gratitude for your kind offers of service and  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my desire to behold once more the too amiable don christoval will not permit my obeying her injunctions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have therefore stolen a moment to inform you that we lodge in the strada di san iago four doors from the palace dalbornos and nearly opposite to the barbers miguel coello <end> <end> 
<start> <start> enquire for donna elvira dalfa since in compliance with her fatherinlaws order my sister continues to be called by her maiden name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at eight this evening you will be sure of finding us but let not a word drop which may raise a suspicion of my having written this letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should you see the conde dossorio tell him  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i blush while i declare it  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him that his presence will be but too acceptable to the sympathetic leonella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter sentences were written in red ink to express the blushes of her cheek while she committed an outrage upon her virgin modesty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo had no sooner perused this note than he set out in search of don christoval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not being able to find him in the course of the day he proceeded to donna elviras alone to leonellas infinite disappointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the domestic by whom he sent up his name having already declared his lady to be at home she had no excuse for refusing his visit yet she consented to receive it with much reluctance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that reluctance was increased by the changes which his approach produced in antonias countenance nor was it by any means abated when the youth himself appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the symmetry of his person animation of his features and natural elegance of his manners and address convinced elvira that such a guest must be dangerous for her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she resolved to treat him with distant politeness to decline his services with gratitude for the tender of them and to make him feel without offence that his future visits would be far from acceptable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his entrance he found elvira who was indisposed reclining upon a sopha antonia sat by her embroidery frame and leonella in a pastoral dress held montemayors diana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of her being the mother of antonia lorenzo could not help expecting to find in elvira leonellas true sister and the daughter of as honest a painstaking shoemaker as any in cordova <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a single glance was sufficient to undeceive him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he beheld a woman whose features though impaired by time and sorrow still bore the marks of distinguished beauty a serious dignity reigned upon her countenance but was tempered by a grace and sweetness which rendered her truly enchanting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo fancied that she must have resembled her daughter in her youth and readily excused the imprudence of the late conde de las cisternas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she desired him to be seated and immediately resumed her place upon the sopha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antonia received him with a simple reverence and continued her work her cheeks were suffused with crimson and she strove to conceal her emotion by leaning over her embroidery frame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her aunt also chose to play off her airs of modesty she affected to blush and tremble and waited with her eyes cast down to receive as she expected the compliments of don christoval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finding after some time that no sign of his approach was given she ventured to look round the room and perceived with vexation that medina was unaccompanied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> impatience would not permit her waiting for an explanation interrupting lorenzo who was delivering raymonds message she desired to know what was become of his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he who thought it necessary to maintain himself in her good graces strove to console her under her disappointment by committing a little violence upon truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> segnora he replied in a melancholy voice how grieved will he be at losing this opportunity of paying you his respects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a relations illness has obliged him to quit madrid in haste but on his return he will doubtless seize the first moment with as he said this his eyes met those of elvira she punished his falsehood sufficiently by darting at him a look expressive of displeasure and reproach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither did the deceit answer his intention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vexed and disappointed leonella rose from her seat and retired in dudgeon to her own apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo hastened to repair the fault which had injured him in elviras opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he related his conversation with the marquis respecting her he assured her that raymond was prepared to acknowledge her for his brothers widow and that till it was in his power to pay his compliments to her in person lorenzo was commissioned to supply his place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this intelligence relieved elvira from an heavy weight of uneasiness she had now found a protector for the fatherless antonia for whose future fortunes she had suffered the greatest apprehensions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not sparing of her thanks to him who had interfered so generously in her behalf but still she gave him no invitation to repeat his visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however when upon rising to depart he requested permission to enquire after her health occasionally the polite earnestness of his manner gratitude for his services and respect for his friend the marquis would not admit of a refusal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she consented reluctantly to receive him he promised not to abuse her goodness and quitted the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antonia was now left alone with her mother a temporary silence ensued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both wished to speak upon the same subject but neither knew how to introduce it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the one felt a bashfulness which sealed up her lips and for which she could not account the other feared to find her apprehensions true or to inspire her daughter with notions to which she might be still a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length elvira began the conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a charming young man antonia i am much pleased with he quitted me not for a moment while i staid in the church he indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why then have you never mentioned his name to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your aunt lanched out in praise of his friend and you vaunted ambrosios eloquence but neither said a word of don lorenzos person and accomplishments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had not leonella spoken of his readiness to undertake our cause i should not have known him to she paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps you judge him less favourably than i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in my opinion his figure is pleasing his conversation sensible and manners engaging <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still he may have struck you differently you may think him disagreeable and  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear mother how should i possibly think him so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should be very ungrateful were i not sensible of his kindness yesterday and very blind if his merits had escaped me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his figure is so graceful so noble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his manners so gentle yet so manly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never yet saw so many accomplishments united in one why then were you so silent in praise of this phoenix of madrid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why was it concealed from me that his society had afforded you in truth i know not you ask me a question which i cannot resolve myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was on the point of mentioning him a thousand times his name was constantly upon my lips but when i would have pronounced it i wanted courage to execute my design <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however if i did not speak of him it was not that i thought of that i believe but shall i tell you why you wanted courage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was because accustomed to confide to me your most secret thoughts you knew not how to conceal yet feared to acknowledge that your heart nourished a sentiment which you were conscious i antonia quitted her embroidery frame threw herself upon her knees by the sopha and hid her face in her mothers lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> consider me equally as your friend and parent and apprehend no reproof from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have read the emotions of your bosom you are yet illskilled in concealing them and they could not escape my attentive eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this lorenzo is dangerous to your repose he has already made an impression upon your heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis true that i perceive easily that your affection is returned but what can be the consequences of this attachment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are poor and friendless my antonia lorenzo is the heir of the duke of medina celi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even should himself mean honourably his uncle never will consent to your union nor without that uncles consent will i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by sad experience i know what sorrows she must endure who marries into a family unwilling to receive her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then struggle with your affection whatever pains it may cost you strive to conquer it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your heart is tender and susceptible it has already received a strong impression but when once convinced that you should not encourage such sentiments i trust that you have sufficient fortitude to antonia kissed her hand and promised implicit obedience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to prevent your passion from growing stronger it will be needful to prohibit lorenzos visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the service which he has rendered me permits not my forbidding them positively but unless i judge too favourably of his character he will discontinue them without taking offence if i confess to him my reasons and throw myself entirely on his generosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next time that i see him i will honestly avow to him the embarrassment which his presence occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is not this measure antonia subscribed to every thing without hesitation though not without regret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her mother kissed her affectionately and retired to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antonia followed her example and vowed so frequently never more to think of lorenzo that till sleep closed her eyes she thought of nothing else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while this was passing at elviras lorenzo hastened to rejoin the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every thing was ready for the second elopement of agnes and at twelve the two friends with a coach and four were at the garden wall of the convent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> don raymond drew out his key and unlocked the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they entered and waited for some time in expectation of being joined by agnes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length the marquis grew impatient beginning to fear that his second attempt would succeed no better than the first he proposed to reconnoitre the convent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every thing was still and dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prioress was anxious to keep the story a secret fearing lest the crime of one of its members should bring disgrace upon the whole community or that the interposition of powerful relations should deprive her vengeance of its intended victim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took care therefore to give the lover of agnes no cause to suppose that his design was discovered and his mistress on the point of suffering the punishment of her fault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same reason made her reject the idea of arresting the unknown seducer in the garden such a proceeding would have created much disturbance and the disgrace of her convent would have been noised about madrid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she contented herself with confining agnes closely as to the lover she left him at liberty to pursue his designs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what she had expected was the result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis and lorenzo waited in vain till the break of day they then retired without noise alarmed at the failure of their plan and ignorant of the cause of its illsuccess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning lorenzo went to the convent and requested to see his sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prioress appeared at the grate with a melancholy countenance she informed him that for several days agnes had appeared much agitated that she had been prest by the nuns in vain to reveal the cause and apply to their tenderness for advice and consolation that she had obstinately persisted in concealing the cause of her distress but that on thursday evening it had produced so violent an effect upon her constitution that she had fallen ill and was actually confined to her bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo did not credit a syllable of this account he insisted upon seeing his sister if she was unable to come to the grate he desired to be admitted to her cell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was shocked at the very idea of a mans profane eye pervading the interior of her holy mansion and professed herself astonished that lorenzo could think of such a thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told him that his request could not be granted but that if he returned the next day she hoped that her beloved daughter would then be sufficiently recovered to join him at the parlour grate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this answer lorenzo was obliged to retire unsatisfied and trembling for his sisters safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he returned the next morning at an early hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes was worse the physician had pronounced her to be in imminent danger she was ordered to remain quiet and it was utterly impossible for her to receive her brothers visit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo stormed at this answer but there was no resource <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raved he entreated he threatened no means were left untried to obtain a sight of agnes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his endeavours were as fruitless as those of the day before and he returned in despair to the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his side the latter had spared no pains to discover what had occasioned his plot to fail don christoval to whom the affair was now entrusted endeavoured to worm out the secret from the old porteress of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare with whom he had formed an acquaintance but she was too much upon her guard and he gained from her no intelligence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis was almost distracted and lorenzo felt scarcely less inquietude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both were convinced that the purposed elopement must have been discovered they doubted not but the malady of agnes was a pretence but they knew not by what means to rescue her from the hands of the prioress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> regularly every day did lorenzo visit the convent as regularly was he informed that his sister rather grew worse than better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certain that her indisposition was feigned these accounts did not alarm him but his ignorance of her fate and of the motives which induced the prioress to keep her from him excited the most serious uneasiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was still uncertain what steps he ought to take when the marquis received a letter from the cardinalduke of lerma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it inclosed the popes expected bull ordering that agnes should be released from her vows and restored to her relations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this essential paper decided at once the proceedings of her friends they resolved that lorenzo should carry it to the domina without delay and demand that his sister should be instantly given up to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> against this mandate illness could not be pleaded it gave her brother the power of removing her instantly to the palace de medina and he determined to use that power on the following day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mind relieved from inquietude respecting his sister and his spirits raised by the hope of soon restoring her to freedom he now had time to give a few moments to love and to antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same hour as on his former visit he repaired to donna elviras she had given orders for his admission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as he was announced her daughter retired with leonella and when he entered the chamber he found the lady of the house alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she received him with less distance than before and desired him to place himself near her upon the sopha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then without losing time opened her business as had been agreed between herself and antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must not think me ungrateful don lorenzo or forgetful how essential are the services which you have rendered me with the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel the weight of my obligations nothing under the sun should induce my taking the step to which i am now compelled but the interest of my child of my beloved antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my health is declining god only knows how soon i may be summoned before his throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my daughter will be left without parents and should she lose the protection of the cisternas family without friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is young and artless uninstructed in the worlds perfidy and with charms sufficient to render her an object of seduction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge then how i must tremble at the prospect before her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge how anxious i must be to keep her from their society who may excite the yet dormant passions of her bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are amiable don lorenzo antonia has a susceptible a loving heart and is grateful for the favours conferred upon us by your interference with the marquis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your presence makes me tremble i fear lest it should inspire her with sentiments which may embitter the remainder of her life or encourage her to cherish hopes in her situation unjustifiable and futile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pardon me when i avow my terrors and let my frankness plead in my excuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot forbid you my house for gratitude restrains me i can only throw myself upon your generosity and entreat you to spare the feelings of an anxious of a doting mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> believe me when i assure you that i lament the necessity of rejecting your acquaintance but there is no remedy and antonias interest obliges me to beg you to forbear your visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by complying with my request you will increase the esteem which i already feel for you and of which everything convinces me that you are truly your frankness charms me replied lorenzo you shall find that in your favourable opinion of me you were not deceived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet i hope that the reasons now in my power to allege will persuade you to withdraw a request which i cannot obey without infinite reluctance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i love your daughter love her most sincerely i wish for no greater happiness than to inspire her with the same sentiments and receive her hand at the altar as her husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis true i am not rich myself my fathers death has left me but little in my own possession but my expectations justify my he was proceeding but elvira interrupted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> don lorenzo you forget in that pompous title the meanness of my origin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you forget that i have now past fourteen years in spain disavowed by my husbands family and existing upon a stipend barely sufficient for the support and education of my daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay i have even been neglected by most of my own relations who out of envy affect to doubt the reality of my marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my allowance being discontinued at my fatherinlaws death i was reduced to the very brink of want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this situation i was found by my sister who amongst all her foibles possesses a warm generous and affectionate heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she aided me with the little fortune which my father left her persuaded me to visit madrid and has supported my child and myself since our quitting murcia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then consider not antonia as descended from the conde de la cisternas consider her as a poor and unprotected orphan as the grandchild of the tradesman torribio dalfa as the needy pensioner of that tradesmans daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reflect upon the difference between such a situation and that of the nephew and heir of the potent duke of medina <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe your intentions to be honourable but as there are no hopes that your uncle will approve of the union i foresee that the consequences of your pardon me segnora you are misinformed if you suppose the duke of medina to resemble the generality of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his sentiments are liberal and disinterested he loves me well and i have no reason to dread his forbidding the marriage when he perceives that my happiness depends upon antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but supposing him to refuse his sanction what have i still to fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my parents are no more my little fortune is in my own possession it will be sufficient to support antonia and i shall exchange for her hand you are young and eager it is natural for you to entertain such ideas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but experience has taught me to my cost that curses accompany an unequal alliance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i married the conde de las cisternas in opposition to the will of his relations many an heartpang has punished me for the imprudent step <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereever we bent our course a fathers execration pursued gonzalvo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poverty overtook us and no friend was near to relieve our wants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still our mutual affection existed but alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> accustomed to wealth and ease ill could my husband support the transition to distress and indigence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked back with repining to the comforts which he once enjoyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he regretted the situation which for my sake he had quitted and in moments when despair possessed his mind has reproached me with having made him the companion of want and wretchedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has called me his bane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the source of his sorrows the cause of his destruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he little knew how much keener were my own hearts reproaches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was ignorant that i suffered trebly for myself for my children and for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis true that his anger seldom lasted long his sincere affection for me soon revived in his heart and then his repentance for the tears which he had made me shed tortured me even more than his reproaches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would throw himself on the ground implore my forgiveness in the most frantic terms and load himself with curses for being the murderer of my repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taught by experience that an union contracted against the inclinations of families on either side must be unfortunate i will save my daughter from those miseries which i have suffered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without your uncles consent while i live she never shall be yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> undoubtedly he will disapprove of the union his power is immense and antonia shall not be exposed to his anger his persecution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how easily may that be avoided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let the worst happen it is but quitting spain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wealth may easily be realised the indian islands will offer us a secure retreat i have an estate though not of value in hispaniola thither will we fly and i shall consider it to be my native country if it ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youth this is a fond romantic vision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fancied that he could leave spain without regret but the moment of parting undeceived him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know not yet what it is to quit your native land to quit it never to behold it more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know not what it is to exchange the scenes where you have passed your infancy for unknown realms and barbarous climates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be forgotten utterly eternally forgotten by the companions of your youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to see your dearest friends the fondest objects of your affection perishing with diseases incidental to indian atmospheres and find yourself unable to procure for them necessary assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my husband and two sweet babes found their graves in cuba nothing would have saved my young antonia but my sudden return to spain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> don lorenzo could you conceive what i suffered during my absence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could you know how sorely i regretted all that i left behind and how dear to me was the very name of spain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i envied the winds which blew towards it and when the spanish sailor chaunted some wellknown air as he past my window tears filled my eyes while i thought upon my native land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her voice faltered and she concealed her face with her handkerchief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a short silence she rose from the sopha and proceeded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse my quitting you for a few moments the remembrance of what i have suffered has much agitated me and i need to be alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> till i return peruse these lines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after my husbands death i found them among his papers had i known sooner that he entertained such sentiments grief would have killed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wrote these verses on his voyage to cuba when his mind was clouded by sorrow and he forgot that he had a wife and children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what we are losing ever seems to us the most precious gonzalvo was quitting spain for ever and therefore was spain dearer to his eyes than all else which the world contained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> read them don lorenzo they will give you some idea of the feelings of a elvira put a paper into lorenzos hand and retired from the chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the youth examined the contents and found them to be as follows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these banished eyes shall view thy coasts no more a mournful presage tells my heart that never gonzalvos steps again shall press thy shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hushed are the winds while soft the vessel sailing with gentle motion plows the unruffled main i feel my bosoms boasted courage failing and curse the waves which bear me far from spain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath yon blue clear heaven still do the spires so well beloved appear from yonder craggy point the gale of even propped on some mosscrowned rock and gaily singing there in the sun his nets the fisher dries oft have i heard the plaintive ballad bringing scenes of past joys before my sorrowing eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waits the accustomed hour when twilightgloom obscures the closing sky then gladly seeks his loved paternal bower friendship and love his cottage guests receive him with honest welcome and with smile sincere no threatening woes of present joys bereave him no sigh his bosom owns his cheek no tear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such bliss to me denying fortune thy lot with envy bids me view me who from home and spain an exile flying bid all i value all i love adieu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no more mine ear shall list the wellknown ditty sung by some mountaingirl who tends her goats some villageswain imploring amorous pity no more my arms a parents fond embraces no more my heart domestic calm must know far from these joys with sighs which memory traces to sultry skies and distant climes i go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where indian suns engender new diseases where snakes and tigers breed i bend my way to brave the feverish thirst no art appeases but not to feel slow pangs consume my liver to die by piecemeal in the bloom of age my boiling blood drank by insatiate fever can make me know such grief as thus to sever with many a bitter sigh dear land from thee to feel this heart must doat on thee for ever and feel that all thy joys are torn from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how oft will fancys spells in slumber recall my native country to my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how oft regret will bid me sadly number each lost delight and dear friend left behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wild murcias vales and loved romantic bowers the river on whose banks a child i played my castles antient halls its frowning towers dreams of the land where all my wishes centre thy scenes which i am doomed no more to know full oft shall memory trace my souls tormentor and turn each pleasure past to present woe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun beneath the waves retires night speeds apace her empire to restore clouds from my sight obscure the villagespires now seen but faintly and now seen no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sleep sleep my bark in silence on the main <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so when tomorrows light shall gild the ocean once more mine eyes shall see the coast of spain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my last petition scorning fresh blows the gale and high the billows swell far shall we be before the break of morning oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then for ever native spain farewell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo had scarcely time to read these lines when elvira returned to him the giving a free course to her tears had relieved her and her spirits had regained their usual composure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have nothing more to say my lord said she you have heard my apprehensions and my reasons for begging you not to repeat your visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have thrown myself in full confidence upon your honour i am certain that you will not prove my opinion of you but one question more segnora and i leave you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should the duke of medina approve my love would my addresses be i will be open with you don lorenzo there being little probability of such an union taking place i fear that it is desired but too ardently by my daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have made an impression upon her young heart which gives me the most serious alarm to prevent that impression from growing stronger i am obliged to decline your acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for me you may be sure that i should rejoice at establishing my child so advantageously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conscious that my constitution impaired by grief and illness forbids me to expect a long continuance in this world i tremble at the thought of leaving her under the protection of a perfect he will marry his lady may look upon antonia with an eye of displeasure and deprive her of her only friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should the duke your uncle give his consent you need not doubt obtaining mine and my daughters but without his hope not for ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at all events what ever steps you may take what ever may be the dukes decision till you know it let me beg your forbearing to strengthen by your presence antonias prepossession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the sanction of your relations authorises your addressing her as your wife my doors fly open to you if that sanction is refused be satisfied to possess my esteem and gratitude but remember that lorenzo promised reluctantly to conform to this decree but he added that he hoped soon to obtain that consent which would give him a claim to the renewal of their acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then explained to her why the marquis had not called in person and made no scruple of confiding to her his sisters history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he concluded by saying that he hoped to set agnes at liberty the next day and that as soon as don raymonds fears were quieted upon this subject he would lose no time in assuring donna elvira of his friendship and protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tremble for your sister said she i have heard many traits of the domina of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clares character from a friend who was educated in the same convent with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reported her to be haughty inflexible superstitious and revengeful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have since heard that she is infatuated with the idea of rendering her convent the most regular in madrid and never forgave those whose imprudence threw upon it the slightest stain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though naturally violent and severe when her interests require it she well knows how to assume an appearance of benignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she leaves no means untried to persuade young women of rank to become members of her community she is implacable when once incensed and has too much intrepidity to shrink at taking the most rigorous measures for punishing the offender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless she will consider your sisters quitting the convent as a disgrace thrown upon it she will use every artifice to avoid obeying the mandate of his holiness and i shudder to think that donna agnes is in the lorenzo now rose to take leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elvira gave him her hand at parting which he kissed respectfully and telling her that he soon hoped for the permission to salute that of antonia he returned to his hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady was perfectly satisfied with the conversation which had past between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked forward with satisfaction to the prospect of his becoming her sonin law but prudence bad her conceal from her daughters knowledge the flattering hopes which herself now ventured to entertain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarcely was it day and already lorenzo was at the convent of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare furnished with the necessary mandate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waited impatiently for the conclusion of the service and at length the prioress appeared at the parlour grate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady replied with a melancholy air that the dear childs situation grew hourly more dangerous that the physicians despaired of her life but that they had declared the only chance for her recovery to consist in keeping her quiet and not to permit those to approach her whose presence was likely to agitate her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a word of all this was believed by lorenzo any more than he credited the expressions of grief and affection for agnes with which this account was interlarded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to end the business he put the popes bull into the hands of the domina and insisted that ill or in health his sister should be delivered to him without delay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prioress received the paper with an air of humility but no sooner had her eye glanced over the contents than her resentment baffled all the efforts of hypocrisy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a deep crimson spread itself over her face and she darted upon lorenzo looks of rage and menace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this order is positive said she in a voice of anger which she in vain strove to disguise willingly would i obey it but lorenzo interrupted her by an exclamation of surprize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i repeat it segnor to obey this order is totally out of my power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from tenderness to a brothers feelings i would have communicated the sad event to you by degrees and have prepared you to hear it with fortitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my measures are broken through this order commands me to deliver up to you the sister agnes without delay i am therefore obliged to inform you without lorenzo started back with horror and turned pale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moments recollection convinced him that this assertion must be false and it restored him to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he passionately but five minutes past since you assured me that though ill she was still alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see her i must and will and every you forget yourself segnor you owe respect to my age as well as my profession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i at first concealed her death it was from dreading lest an event so unexpected should produce on you too violent an effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in truth i am but ill repaid for my attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what interest i pray you should i have in detaining her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to know her wish of quitting our society is a sufficient reason for me to wish her absence and think her a disgrace to the sisterhood of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare but she has forfeited my affection in a manner yet more culpable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her crimes were great and when you know the cause of her death you will doubtless rejoice don lorenzo that such a wretch is no longer in existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was taken ill on thursday last on returning from confession in the capuchin chapel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her malady seemed attended with strange circumstances but she persisted in concealing its cause thanks to the virgin we were too ignorant to suspect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge then what must have been our consternation our horror when she was delivered the next day of a stillborn child whom she immediately followed to the grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it possible that your countenance expresses no surprize no indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it possible that your sisters infamy was known to you and that still she possessed your affection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that case you have no need of my compassion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can say nothing more except repeat my inability of obeying the orders of his holiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes is no more and to convince you that what i say is true i swear by our blessed saviour that here she kissed a small crucifix which hung at her girdle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then rose from her chair and quitted the parlour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she withdrew she cast upon lorenzo a scornful smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farewell segnor said she i know no remedy for this accident i fear that even a second bull from the pope will not lorenzo also retired penetrated with affliction but don raymonds at the news of this event amounted to madness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not be convinced that agnes was really dead and continued to insist that the walls of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no arguments could make him abandon his hopes of regaining her every day some fresh scheme was invented for procuring intelligence of her and all of them were attended with the same success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his part medina gave up the idea of ever seeing his sister more yet he believed that she had been taken off by unfair means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under this persuasion he encouraged don raymonds researches determined should he discover the least warrant for his suspicions to take a severe vengeance upon the unfeeling prioress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the loss of his sister affected him sincerely nor was it the least cause of his distress that propriety obliged him for some time to defer mentioning antonia to the duke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meanwhile his emissaries constantly surrounded elviras door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had intelligence of all the movements of his mistress as she never failed every thursday to attend the sermon in the capuchin cathedral he was secure of seeing her once a week though in compliance with his promise he carefully shunned her observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus two long months passed away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still no information was procured of agnes all but the marquis credited her death and now lorenzo determined to disclose his sentiments to his uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had already dropt some hints of his intention to marry they had been as favourably received as he could expect and he harboured no doubt of the success of his while in each others arms entranced they lay they blessed the night and curst the coming day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the burst of transport was past ambrosios lust was satisfied pleasure fled and shame usurped her seat in his bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> confused and terrified at his weakness he drew himself from matildas arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his perjury presented itself before him he reflected on the scene which had just been acted and trembled at the consequences of a discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked forward with horror his heart was despondent and became the abode of satiety and disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he avoided the eyes of his partner in frailty a melancholy silence prevailed during which both seemed busied with disagreable reflections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda was the first to break it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took his hand gently and pressed it to her burning lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she murmured in a soft and trembling voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abbot started at the sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned his eyes upon matildas they were filled with tears her cheeks were covered with blushes and her supplicating looks seemed to solicit his compassion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he into what an abyss of misery have you plunged me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should your sex be discovered my honour nay my life must pay for the pleasure of a few moments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fool that i was to trust myself to your seductions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can my offence be expiated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what atonement can purchase the pardon of my crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wretched matilda you have destroyed my to me these reproaches ambrosio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to me who have sacrificed for you the worlds pleasures the luxury of wealth the delicacy of sex my friends my fortune and my fame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what have you lost which i preserved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have i not shared in your guilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you not shared in my pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in what consists ours unless in the opinion of an illjudging world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let that world be ignorant of them and our joys become divine and blameless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unnatural were your vows of celibacy man was not created for such a state and were love a crime god never would have made it so sweet so irresistible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then banish those clouds from your brow my ambrosio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indulge in those pleasures freely without which life is a worthless gift cease to reproach me with having taught you what is bliss and feel equal transports as she spoke her eyes were filled with a delicious languor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her bosom panted she twined her arms voluptuously round him drew him towards her and glewed her lips to his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio again raged with desire the die was thrown his vows were already broken he had already committed the crime and why should he refrain from enjoying its reward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clasped her to his breast with redoubled ardour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no longer repressed by the sense of shame he gave a loose to his intemperate appetites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the fair wanton put every invention of lust in practice every refinement in the art of pleasure which might heighten the bliss of her possession and render her lovers transports still more exquisite ambrosio rioted in delights till then unknown to him swift fled the night and the morning blushed to behold him still clasped in the embraces of matilda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> intoxicated with pleasure the monk rose from the syrens luxurious couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he no longer reflected with shame upon his incontinence or dreaded the vengeance of offended heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his only fear was lest death should rob him of enjoyments for which his long fast had only given a keener edge to his appetite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda was still under the influence of poison and the voluptuous monk trembled less for his preservers life than his concubines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deprived of her he would not easily find another mistress with whom he could indulge his passions so fully and so safely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he therefore pressed her with earnestness to use the means of preservation which she had declared to be in her possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied matilda since you have made me feel that life is valuable i will rescue mine at any rate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no dangers shall appall me i will look upon the consequences of my action boldly nor shudder at the horrors which they present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will think my sacrifice scarcely worthy to purchase your possession and remember that a moment past in your arms in this world oerpays an age of punishment in the next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before i take this step ambrosio give me your solemn oath never to enquire he did so in a manner the most binding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this precaution is necessary for though you know it not you are under the command of vulgar prejudices the business on which i must be employed this night might startle you from its singularity and lower me in your opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me are you possessed of the key of the low door the door which opens into the buryingground common to us and the sisterhood of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not the key but can easily you have only this to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> admit me into the buryingground at midnight watch while i descend into the vaults of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare lest some prying eye should observe my actions leave me there alone for an hour and that life is safe which i dedicate to your pleasures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to prevent creating suspicion do not visit me during the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember the key and that i expect you before twelve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leave me i will the friar obeyed and left the cell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he opened the door father pablos made his appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i come said the latter to enquire after the health of my hush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> replied ambrosio laying his finger upon his lip speak softly i am just come from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has fallen into a profound slumber which doubtless will be of service to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not father pablos obeyed and hearing the bell ring accompanied the abbot to matins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio felt embarrassed as he entered the chapel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guilt was new to him and he fancied that every eye could read the transactions of the night upon his countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he strove to pray his bosom no longer glowed with devotion his thoughts insensibly wandered to matildas secret charms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what he wanted in purity of heart he supplied by exterior sanctity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the better to cloak his transgression he redoubled his pretensions to the semblance of virtue and never appeared more devoted to heaven as since he had broken through his engagements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus did he unconsciously add hypocrisy to perjury and incontinence he had fallen into the latter errors from yielding to seduction almost irresistible but he was now guilty of a voluntary fault by endeavouring to conceal those into which another had betrayed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the matins concluded ambrosio retired to his cell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pleasures which he had just tasted for the first time were still impressed upon his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his brain was bewildered and presented a confused chaos of remorse voluptuousness inquietude and fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked back with regret to that peace of soul that security of virtue which till then had been his portion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had indulged in excesses whose very idea but four and twenty hours before he had recoiled at with horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shuddered at reflecting that a trifling indiscretion on his part or on matildas would overturn that fabric of reputation which it had cost him thirty years to erect and render him the abhorrence of that people of whom he was then the idol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conscience painted to him in glaring colours his perjury and weakness apprehension magnified to him the horrors of punishment and he already fancied himself in the prisons of the inquisition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to these tormenting ideas succeeded matildas beauty and those delicious lessons which once learnt can never be forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a single glance thrown upon these reconciled him with himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he considered the pleasures of the former night to have been purchased at an easy price by the sacrifice of innocence and honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their very remembrance filled his soul with ecstacy he cursed his foolish vanity which had induced him to waste in obscurity the bloom of life ignorant of the blessings of love and woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he determined at all events to continue his commerce with matilda and called every argument to his aid which might confirm his resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked himself provided his irregularity was unknown in what would his fault consist and what consequences he had to apprehend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by adhering strictly to every rule of his order save chastity he doubted not to retain the esteem of men and even the protection of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he trusted easily to be forgiven so slight and natural a deviation from his vows but he forgot that having pronounced those vows incontinence in laymen the most venial of errors became in his person the most heinous of crimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once decided upon his future conduct his mind became more easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he threw himself upon his bed and strove by sleeping to recruit his strength exhausted by his nocturnal excesses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he awoke refreshed and eager for a repetition of his pleasures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> obedient to matildas order he visited not her cell during the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father pablos mentioned in the refectory that rosario had at length been prevailed upon to follow his prescription but that the medicine had not produced the slightest effect and that he believed no mortal skill could rescue him from the grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this opinion the abbot agreed and affected to lament the untimely fate of a youth whose talents had appeared so promising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio had taken care to procure from the porter the key of the low door opening into the cemetery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> furnished with this when all was silent in the monastery he quitted his cell and hastened to matildas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had left her bed and was drest before his arrival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been expecting you with impatience said she my life she took a small covered basket from the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bearing this in one hand and the lamp which was flaming upon the hearth in the other she hastened from the cell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she moved on with quick but cautious steps passed through the cloisters and reached the western side of the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes flashed with a fire and wildness which impressed the monk at once with awe and horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a determined desperate courage reigned upon her brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave the lamp to ambrosio then taking from him the key she unlocked the low door and entered the cemetery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a vast and spacious square planted with yew trees half of it belonged to the abbey the other half was the property of the sisterhood of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare and was protected by a roof of stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the division was marked by an iron railing the wicket of which was generally left unlocked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she opened the wicket and sought for the door leading to the subterraneous vaults where reposed the mouldering bodies of the votaries of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was perfectly dark neither moon or stars were visible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> luckily there was not a breath of wind and the friar bore his lamp in full security by the assistance of its beams the door of the sepulchre was soon discovered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was sunk within the hollow of a wall and almost concealed by thick festoons of ivy hanging over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three steps of roughhewn stone conducted to it and matilda was on the point of descending them when she suddenly started back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are people in the vaults <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she whispered to the monk conceal yourself till they are past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took refuge behind a lofty and magnificent tomb erected in honour of the convents foundress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio followed her example carefully hiding his lamp lest its beams should betray them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a few moments had elapsed when the door was pushed open leading to the subterraneous caverns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rays of light proceeded up the staircase they enabled the concealed spectators to observe two females drest in religious habits who seemed engaged in earnest conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abbot had no difficulty to recognize the prioress of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare in the first and one of the elder nuns in her companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every thing is prepared said the prioress her fate shall be decided tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all her tears and sighs will be unavailing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in five and twenty years that i have been superior of this you must expect much opposition to your will the other replied in a milder voice agnes has many friends in the convent and in particular the mother st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ursula will espouse her cause most warmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in truth she merits to have friends and i wish i could prevail upon you to consider her youth and her peculiar situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seems sensible of her fault the excess of her grief proves her penitence and i am convinced that her tears flow more from contrition than fear of punishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reverend mother would you be persuaded to mitigate the severity of your sentence would you but deign to overlook this first transgression i offer myself as the pledge of her future overlook it say you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after disgracing me in the presence of madrids idol of the very man on whom i most wished to impress an idea of the strictness of my discipline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how despicable must i have appeared to the reverend abbot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never can forgive the insult <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot better convince ambrosio that i abhor such crimes than by punishing that of agnes with all the rigour of which our severe laws admit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cease then your supplications they will all be unavailing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my resolution is taken tomorrow agnes shall be the mother camilla seemed not to give up the point but by this time the nuns were out of hearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prioress unlocked the door which communicated with st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clares chapel and having entered with her companion closed it again after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda now asked who was this agnes with whom the prioress was thus incensed and what connexion she could have with ambrosio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he related her adventure and he added that since that time his ideas having undergone a thorough revolution he now felt much compassion for the unfortunate nun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i design said he to request an audience of the domina tomorrow and use every means of obtaining a mitigation of her beware of what you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interrupted matilda your sudden change of sentiment may naturally create surprize and may give birth to suspicions which it is most our interest to avoid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rather redouble your outward austerity and thunder out menaces against the errors of others the better to conceal your own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> abandon the nun to her fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your interfering might be dangerous and her imprudence merits to be punished she is unworthy to enjoy loves pleasures who has not wit enough to conceal them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in discussing this trifling subject i waste moments which are precious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night flies apace and much must be done before morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nuns are retired all is safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must descend alone into these caverns wait here and if any one approaches warn me by your voice but as you value your existence presume not to follow me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your life would thus saying she advanced towards the sepulchre still holding her lamp in one hand and her little basket in the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she touched the door it turned slowly upon its grating hinges and a narrow winding staircase of black marble presented itself to her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio remained above watching the faint beams of the lamp as they still proceeded up the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they disappeared and he found himself in total darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> left to himself he could not reflect without surprize on the sudden change in matildas character and sentiments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a few days had past since she appeared the mildest and softest of her sex devoted to his will and looking up to him as to a superior being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now she assumed a sort of courage and manliness in her manners and discourse but illcalculated to please him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spoke no longer to insinuate but command he found himself unable to cope with her in argument and was unwillingly obliged to confess the superiority of her judgment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every moment convinced him of the astonishing powers of her mind but what she gained in the opinion of the man she lost with interest in the affection of the lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he regretted rosario the fond the gentle and submissive he grieved that matilda preferred the virtues of his sex to those of her own and when he thought of her expressions respecting the devoted nun he could not help blaming them as cruel and unfeminine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pity is a sentiment so natural so appropriate to the female character that it is scarcely a merit for a woman to possess it but to be without it is a grievous crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio could not easily forgive his mistress for being deficient in this amiable quality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however though he blamed her insensibility he felt the truth of her observations and though he pitied sincerely the unfortunate agnes he resolved to drop the idea of interposing in her behalf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near an hour had elapsed since matilda descended into the caverns still she returned not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all was silent except that at intervals he caught the sound of matildas voice as it wound along the subteraneous passages and was reechoed by the sepulchres vaulted roofs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was at too great a distance for him to distinguish her words and ere they reached him they were deadened into a low murmur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he longed to penetrate into this mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolved to disobey her injunctions and follow her into the cavern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he advanced to the staircase he had already descended some steps when his courage failed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remembered matildas menaces if he infringed her orders and his bosom was filled with a secret unaccountable awe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he returned up the stairs resumed his former station and waited impatiently for the conclusion of this adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he was sensible of a violent shock an earthquake rocked the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the columns which supported the roof under which he stood were so strongly shaken that every moment menaced him with its fall and at the same moment he heard a loud and tremendous burst of thunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it ceased and his eyes being fixed upon the staircase he saw a bright column of light flash along the caverns beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was seen but for an instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner did it disappear than all was once more quiet and obscure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> profound darkness again surrounded him and the silence of night was only broken by the whirring bat as she flitted slowly by him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with every instant ambrosios amazement increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another hour elapsed after which the same light again appeared and was lost again as suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was accompanied by a strain of sweet but solemn music which as it stole through the vaults below inspired the monk with mingled delight and terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had not long been hushed when he heard matildas steps upon the staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ascended from the cavern the most lively joy animated her beautiful features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning is on the point of breaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us retire to the with a light step she hastened from the buryingground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she regained her cell and the curious abbot still accompanied her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she closed the door and disembarrassed herself of her lamp and basket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried throwing herself upon his bosom succeeded beyond my fondest hopes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall live ambrosio shall live for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the step which i shuddered at taking proves to me a source of joys inexpressible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i dared communicate those joys to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i were permitted to share with you my power and raise you as high above the level of and what prevents you matilda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interrupted the friar why is your business in the cavern made a secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think me undeserving of your confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda i must doubt the truth of your affection while you have joys in which i am forbidden to you reproach me with injustice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i grieve sincerely that i am obliged to conceal from you my happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am not to blame the fault lies not in me but in yourself my ambrosio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are still too much the monk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your mind is enslaved by the prejudices of education and superstition might make you shudder at the idea of that which experience has taught me to prize and value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at present you are unfit to be trusted with a secret of such importance but the strength of your judgment and the curiosity which i rejoice to see sparkling in your eyes makes me hope that you will one day deserve my confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> till that period arrives restrain your impatience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember that you have given me your solemn oath never to enquire into this nights adventures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i insist upon your keeping this oath for though she added smiling while she sealed his lips with a wanton kiss though i forgive your breaking your vows to heaven i expect you the friar returned the embrace which had set his blood on fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the luxurious and unbounded excesses of the former night were renewed and they separated not till the bell rang for matins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same pleasures were frequently repeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the monks rejoiced in the feigned rosarios unexpected recovery and none of them suspected his real sex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abbot possessed his mistress in tranquillity and perceiving his frailty unsuspected abandoned himself to his passions in full security <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shame and remorse no longer tormented him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frequent repetitions made him familiar with sin and his bosom became proof against the stings of conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in these sentiments he was encouraged by matilda but she soon was aware that she had satiated her lover by the unbounded freedom of her caresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her charms becoming accustomed to him they ceased to excite the same desires which at first they had inspired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the delirium of passion being past he had leisure to observe every trifling defect where none were to be found satiety made him fancy them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the monk was glutted with the fullness of pleasure a week had scarcely elapsed before he was wearied of his paramour his warm constitution still made him seek in her arms the gratification of his lust but when the moment of passion was over he quitted her with disgust and his humour naturally inconstant made him sigh impatiently for variety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> possession which cloys man only increases the affection of woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda with every succeeding day grew more attached to the friar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since he had obtained her favours he was become dearer to her than ever and she felt grateful to him for the pleasures in which they had equally been sharers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unfortunately as her passion grew ardent ambrosios grew cold the very marks of her fondness excited his disgust and its excess served to extinguish the flame which already burned but feebly in his bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda could not but remark that her society seemed to him daily less agreeable he was inattentive while she spoke her musical talents which she possessed in perfection had lost the power of amusing him or if he deigned to praise them his compliments were evidently forced and cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he no longer gazed upon her with affection or applauded her sentiments with a lovers partiality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this matilda well perceived and redoubled her efforts to revive those sentiments which he once had felt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could not but fail since he considered as importunities the pains which she took to please him and was disgusted by the very means which she used to recall the wanderer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still however their illicit commerce continued but it was clear that he was led to her arms not by love but the cravings of brutal appetite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his constitution made a woman necessary to him and matilda was the only one with whom he could indulge his passions safely in spite of her beauty he gazed upon every other female with more desire but fearing that his hypocrisy should be made public he confined his inclinations to his own breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was by no means his nature to be timid but his education had impressed his mind with fear so strongly that apprehension was now become part of his character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had his youth been passed in the world he would have shown himself possessed of many brilliant and manly qualities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was naturally enterprizing firm and fearless he had a warriors heart and he might have shone with splendour at the head of an army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no want of generosity in his nature the wretched never failed to find in him a compassionate auditor his abilities were quick and shining and his judgment vast solid and decisive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with such qualifications he would have been an ornament to his country that he possessed them he had given proofs in his earliest infancy and his parents had beheld his dawning virtues with the fondest delight and admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unfortunately while yet a child he was deprived of those parents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell into the power of a relation whose only wish about him was never to hear of him more for that purpose he gave him in charge to his friend the former superior of the capuchins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abbot a very monk used all his endeavours to persuade the boy that happiness existed not without the walls of a convent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to deserve admittance into the order of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his instructors carefully repressed those virtues whose grandeur and disinterestedness were illsuited to the cloister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of universal benevolence he adopted a selfish partiality for his own particular establishment he was taught to consider compassion for the errors of others as a crime of the blackest dye the noble frankness of his temper was exchanged for servile humility and in order to break his natural spirit the monks terrified his young mind by placing before him all the horrors with which superstition could furnish them they painted to him the torments of the damned in colours the most dark terrible and fantastic and threatened him at the slightest fault with eternal perdition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder that his imagination constantly dwelling upon these fearful objects should have rendered his character timid and apprehensive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> add to this that his long absence from the great world and total unacquaintance with the common dangers of life made him form of them an idea far more dismal than the reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the monks were busied in rooting out his virtues and narrowing his sentiments they allowed every vice which had fallen to his share to arrive at full perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was suffered to be proud vain ambitious and disdainful he was jealous of his equals and despised all merit but his own he was implacable when offended and cruel in his revenge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still in spite of the pains taken to pervert them his natural good qualities would at such times the contest for superiority between his real and acquired character was striking and unaccountable to those unacquainted with his original disposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pronounced the most severe sentences upon offenders which the moment after compassion induced him to mitigate he undertook the most daring enterprizes which the fear of their consequences soon obliged him to abandon his inborn genius darted a brilliant light upon subjects the most obscure and almost instantaneously his superstition replunged them in darkness more profound than that from which they had just been rescued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his brother monks regarding him as a superior being remarked not this contradiction in their idols conduct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were persuaded that what he did must be right and supposed him to have good reasons for changing his resolutions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact was that the different sentiments with which education and nature had inspired him were combating in his bosom it remained for his passions which as yet no opportunity had called into play to decide the victory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unfortunately his passions were the very worst judges to whom he could possibly have applied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his monastic seclusion had till now been in his favour since it gave him no room for discovering his bad qualities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the superiority of his talents raised him too far above his companions to permit his being jealous of them his exemplary piety persuasive eloquence and pleasing manners had secured him universal esteem and consequently he had no injuries to revenge his ambition was justified by his acknowledged merit and his pride considered as no more than proper confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never saw much less conversed with the other sex he was ignorant of the pleasures in womans power to bestow and if he read in the course of his for a time spare diet frequent watching and severe penance cooled and represt the natural warmth of his constitution but no sooner did opportunity present itself no sooner did he catch a glimpse of joys to which he was still a stranger than religions barriers were too feeble to resist the overwhelming torrent of his desires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all impediments yielded before the force of his temperament warm sanguine and voluptuous in the excess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as yet his other passions lay dormant but they only needed to be once awakened to display themselves with violence as great and irresistible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he continued to be the admiration of madrid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the enthusiasm created by his eloquence seemed rather to increase than diminish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every thursday which was the only day when he appeared in public the capuchin cathedral was crowded with auditors and his discourse was always received with the same approbation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was named confessor to all the chief families in madrid and no one was counted fashionable who was injoined penance by any other than ambrosio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his resolution of never stirring out of his convent he still persisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this circumstance created a still greater opinion of his sanctity and selfdenial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above all the women sang forth his praises loudly less influenced by devotion than by his noble countenance majestic air and wellturned graceful figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abbey door was thronged with carriages from morning to night and the noblest and fairest dames of madrid confessed to the abbot their secret peccadilloes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eyes of the luxurious friar devoured their charms had his penitents consulted those interpreters he would have needed no other means of expressing his desires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for his misfortune they were so strongly persuaded of his continence that the possibility of his harbouring indecent thoughts never once entered their imaginations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the climates heat tis well known operates with no small influence upon the constitutions of the spanish ladies but the most abandoned would have thought it an easier task to inspire with passion the marble statue of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis than the cold and rigid heart of the immaculate ambrosio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his part the friar was little acquainted with the depravity of the world he suspected not that but few of his penitents would have rejected his addresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet had he been better instructed on this head the danger attending such an attempt would have sealed up his lips in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that it would be difficult for a woman to keep a secret so strange and so important as his frailty and he even trembled lest matilda should betray him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anxious to preserve a reputation which was infinitely dear to him he saw all the risque of committing it to the power of some vain giddy female and as the beauties of madrid affected only his senses without touching his heart he forgot them as soon as they were out of his sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the danger of discovery the fear of being repulsed the loss of reputation all these considerations counselled him to stifle his desires and though he now felt for it the most perfect indifference he was necessitated to confine himself to matildas person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one morning the confluence of penitents was greater than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was detained in the confessional chair till a late hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length the crowd was dispatched and he prepared to quit the chapel when two females entered and drew near him with humility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they threw up their veils and the youngest entreated him to listen to her for a few moments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the melody of her voice of that voice to which no man ever listened without interest immediately caught ambrosios attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the petitioner seemed bowed down with affliction her cheeks were pale her eyes dimmed with tears and her hair fell in disorder over her face and bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still her countenance was so sweet so innocent so heavenly as might have charmed an heart less susceptible than that which panted in the abbots breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with more than usual softness of manner he desired her to proceed and heard her speak as follows with an emotion which increased every moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reverend father you see an unfortunate threatened with the loss of her dearest of almost her only friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother my excellent mother lies upon the bed of sickness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sudden and dreadful malady seized her last night and so rapid has been its progress that the physicians despair of her life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> human aid fails me nothing remains for me but to implore the mercy of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father all madrid rings with the report of your piety and virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deign to remember my mother in your prayers perhaps they may prevail on the almighty to spare her and should that be the case i engage myself every thursday in the next three months to illuminate the shrine of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thought the monk here we have a second vincentio della ronda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rosarios adventure began thus and he wished secretly that this might have the same conclusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the petitioner returned him thanks with every mark of gratitude and then continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have yet another favour to ask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are strangers in madrid my mother needs a confessor and knows not to whom she should apply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we understand that you never quit the abbey and alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my poor mother is unable to come hither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you would have the goodness reverend father to name a proper person whose wise and pious consolations may soften the agonies of my parents deathbed you will confer an everlasting favour upon hearts not with this petition also the monk complied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed what petition would he have refused if urged in such enchanting accents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her voice was so sweet so harmonious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her very tears became her and her affliction seemed to add new lustre to her charms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he promised to send to her a confessor that same evening and begged her to leave her address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the companion presented him with a card on which it was written and then withdrew with the fair petitioner who pronounced before her departure a thousand benedictions on the abbots goodness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes followed her out of the chapel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not till she was out of sight that he examined the card on which he read the following words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> donna elvira dalfa strada di san iago four doors from the the suppliant was no other than antonia and leonella was her companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter had not consented without difficulty to accompany her niece to the abbey ambrosio had inspired her with such awe that she trembled at the very sight of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her fears had conquered even her natural loquacity and while in his presence she uttered not a single syllable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the monk retired to his cell whither he was pursued by antonias image <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt a thousand new emotions springing in his bosom and he trembled to examine into the cause which gave them birth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were totally different from those inspired by matilda when she first declared her sex and her affection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt not the provocation of lust no voluptuous desires rioted in his bosom nor did a burning imagination picture to him the charms which modesty had veiled from his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary what he now felt was a mingled sentiment of tenderness admiration and respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a soft and delicious melancholy infused itself into his soul and he would not have exchanged it for the most lively transports of joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> society now disgusted him he delighted in solitude which permitted his indulging the visions of fancy his thoughts were all gentle sad and soothing and the whole wide world presented him with no other object than antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed in his romantic enthusiasm happy man who is destined to possess the heart of that lovely girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how enchanting was the timid innocence of her eyes and how different from the wanton expression the wild luxurious fire which sparkles in matildas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sweeter must one kiss be snatched from the rosy lips of the first than all the full and lustful favours bestowed so freely by the second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda gluts me with enjoyment even to loathing forces me to her arms apes the harlot and glories in her prostitution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did she know the inexpressible charm of modesty how irresistibly it enthralls the heart of man how firmly it chains him to the throne of beauty she never would have thrown it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would be too dear a price for this lovely girls affections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would i refuse to sacrifice could i be released from my vows and permitted to declare my love in the sight of earth and heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while i strove to inspire her with tenderness with friendship and esteem how tranquil and undisturbed would the hours roll away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to see her blue downcast eyes beam upon mine with timid fondness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to sit for days for years listening to that gentle voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to acquire the right of obliging her and hear the artless expressions of her gratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to watch the emotions of her spotless heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to share in her joy when happy to kiss away her tears when distrest and to see her fly to my arms for comfort and support <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes if there is perfect bliss on earth tis his lot while his fancy coined these ideas he paced his cell with a disordered air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes were fixed upon vacancy his head reclined upon his shoulder a tear rolled down his cheek while he reflected that the vision of happiness for him could never be realized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he continued by marriage she cannot be mine and to seduce such innocence to use the confidence reposed in me to work her ruin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be a crime blacker than yet the world ever witnessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your virtue runs no risque from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not for indies would again he paced his chamber hastily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then stopping his eye fell upon the picture of his onceadmired madona <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tore it with indignation from the wall he threw it on the ground and spurned it from him with his foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her paramour forgot that for his sake alone she had forfeited her claim to virtue and his only reason for despising her was that she had loved him much too well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he threw himself into a chair which stood near the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the card with elviras address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took it up and it brought to his recollection his promise respecting a confessor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he passed a few minutes in doubt but antonias empire over him was already too much decided to permit his making a long resistance to the idea which struck him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolved to be the confessor himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could leave the abbey unobserved without difficulty by wrapping up his head in his cowl he hoped to pass through the streets without being recognised by taking these precautions and by recommending secrecy to elviras family he doubted not to keep madrid in ignorance that he had broken his vow never to see the outside of the abbey walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda was the only person whose vigilance he dreaded but by informing her at the refectory that during the whole of that day business would confine him to his cell he thought himself secure from her wakeful jealousy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> accordingly at the hours when the spaniards are generally taking their siesta he ventured to quit the abbey by a private door the key of which was in his possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cowl of his habit was thrown over his face from the heat of the weather the streets were almost totally deserted the monk met with few people found the strada di san iago and arrived without accident at donna elviras door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rang was admitted and immediately ushered into an upper apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was here that he ran the greatest risque of a discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had leonella been at home she would have recognized him directly her communicative disposition would never have permitted her to rest till all madrid was informed that ambrosio had ventured out of the abbey and visited her sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortune here stood the monks friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on leonellas return home she found a letter instructing her that a cousin was just dead who had left what little he possessed between herself and elvira <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to secure this bequest she was obliged to set out for cordova without losing a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amidst all her foibles her heart was truly warm and affectionate and she was unwilling to quit her sister in so dangerous a state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but elvira insisted upon her taking the journey conscious that in her daughters forlorn situation no increase of fortune however trifling ought to be neglected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> accordingly leonella left madrid sincerely grieved at her sisters illness and giving some few sighs to the memory of the amiable but inconstant don christoval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was fully persuaded that at first she had made a terrible breach in his heart but hearing nothing more of him she supposed that he had quitted the pursuit disgusted by the lowness of her origin and knowing upon other terms than marriage he had nothing to hope from such a dragon of virtue as she professed herself or else that being naturally capricious and changeable the remembrance of her charms had been effaced from the condes heart by those of some newer beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever was the cause of her losing him she lamented it sorely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she strove in vain as she assured every body who was kind enough to listen to her to tear his image from her too susceptible heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she affected the airs of a lovesick virgin and carried them all to the most ridiculous excess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she heaved lamentable sighs walked with her arms folded uttered long soliloquies and her discourse generally turned upon some forsaken maid who expired of a broken heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her fiery locks were always ornamented with a garland of willow every evening she was seen straying upon the banks of a rivulet by moonlight and she declared herself a violent admirer of murmuring streams of lonely haunts and twilight groves such was the state of leonellas mind when obliged to quit madrid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elvira was out of patience at all these follies and endeavoured at persuading her to act like a reasonable woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her advice was thrown away leonella assured her at parting that nothing could make her forget the perfidious don christoval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this point she was fortunately mistaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an honest youth of cordova journeyman to an apothecary found that her fortune would be sufficient to set him up in a genteel shop of his own in consequence of this reflection he avowed himself her admirer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ardour of his sighs melted her heart and she soon consented to make him the happiest of mankind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wrote to inform her sister of her marriage but for reasons which will be explained hereafter elvira never answered her letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio was conducted into the antichamber to that where elvira was reposing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the female domestic who had admitted him left him alone while she announced his arrival to her mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antonia who had been by her mothers bedside immediately came to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pardon me father said she advancing towards him when recognizing his features she stopped suddenly and uttered a cry do not my eyes deceive me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has the worthy ambrosio broken through his resolution that he may soften the agonies of the best of women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what pleasure will this visit give my mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me not delay for a moment the comfort which your piety and thus saying she opened the chamber door presented to her mother her distinguished visitor and having placed an armedchair by the side of the bed withdrew into another department <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elvira was highly gratified by this visit her expectations had been raised high by general report but she found them far exceeded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio endowed by nature with powers of pleasing exerted them to the utmost while conversing with antonias mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with persuasive eloquence he calmed every fear and dissipated every scruple he bad her reflect on the infinite mercy of her judge despoiled death of his darts and terrors and taught her to view without shrinking the abyss of eternity on whose brink she then stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elvira was absorbed in attention and delight while she listened to his exhortations confidence and comfort stole insensibly into her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she unbosomed to him without hesitation her cares and apprehensions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter respecting a future life he had already quieted and he now removed the former which she felt for the concerns of this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had none to whose care she could recommend her save to the marquis de las cisternas and her sister leonella <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the protection of the one was very uncertain and as to the other though fond of her niece leonella was so thoughtless and vain as to make her an improper person to have the sole direction of a girl so young and ignorant of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the friar no sooner learnt the cause of her alarms than he begged her to make herself easy upon that head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he doubted not being able to secure for antonia a safe refuge in the house of one of his penitents the marchioness of villafranca this was a lady of acknowledged virtue remarkable for strict principles and extensive charity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should accident deprive her of this resource he engaged to procure antonia a reception in some respectable convent that is to say in quality of boarder for elvira had declared herself no friend to a monastic life and the monk was either candid or complaisant enough to allow that her disapprobation was not unfounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these proofs of the interest which he felt for her completely won elviras heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in thanking him she exhausted every expression which gratitude could furnish and protested that now she should resign herself with tranquillity to the grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio rose to take leave he promised to return the next day at the same hour but requested that his visits might be kept secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am unwilling said he that my breaking through a rule imposed by necessity should be generally known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had i not resolved never to quit my convent except upon circumstances as urgent as that which has conducted me to your door i should be frequently summoned upon insignificant occasions that time would be engrossed by the curious the unoccupied and the fanciful which i now pass at the bedside of the sick in comforting the expiring penitent and clearing the passage to elvira commended equally his prudence and compassion promising to conceal carefully the honour of his visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the monk then gave her his benediction and retired from the chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the antiroom he found antonia he could not refuse himself the pleasure of passing a few moments in her society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he bad her take comfort for that her mother seemed composed and tranquil and he hoped that she might yet do well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he enquired who attended her and engaged to send the physician of his convent to see her one of the most skilful in madrid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then launched out in elviras commendation praised her purity and fortitude of mind and declared that she had inspired him with the highest esteem and reverence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antonias innocent heart swelled with gratitude joy danced in her eyes where a tear still sparkled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hopes which he gave her of her mothers recovery the lively interest which he seemed to feel for her and the flattering way in which she was mentioned by him added to the report of his judgment and virtue and to the impression made upon her by his eloquence confirmed the favourable opinion with which his first appearance had inspired antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she replied with diffidence but without restraint she feared not to relate to him all her little sorrows all her little fears and anxieties and she thanked him for his goodness with all the genuine warmth which favours kindle in a young and innocent heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such alone know how to estimate benefits at their full value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they who are conscious of mankinds perfidy and selfishness ever receive an obligation with apprehension and distrust they suspect that some secret motive must lurk behind it they express their thanks with restraint and caution and fear to praise a kind action to its full extent aware that some future day a return may be required <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not so antonia she thought the world was composed only of those who resembled her and that vice existed was to her still a secret <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the monk had been of service to her he said that he wished her well she was grateful for his kindness and thought that no terms were strong enough to be the vehicle of her thanks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with what delight did ambrosio listen to the declaration of her artless gratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the natural grace of her manners the unequalled sweetness of her voice her modest vivacity her unstudied elegance her expressive countenance and intelligent eyes united to inspire him with pleasure and admiration while the solidity and correctness of her remarks received additional beauty from the unaffected simplicity of the language in which they were conveyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio was at length obliged to tear himself from this conversation which possessed for him but too many charms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he repeated to antonia his wishes that his visits should not be made known which desire she promised to observe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then quitted the house while his enchantress hastened to her mother ignorant of the mischief which her beauty had caused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was eager to know elviras opinion of the man whom she had praised in such enthusiastic terms and was delighted to find it equally favourable if not even more so than her own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even before he spoke said elvira i was prejudiced in his favour the fervour of his exhortations dignity of his manner and closeness of his reasoning were very far from inducing me to alter my opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his fine and fulltoned voice struck me particularly but surely antonia i have heard it before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed perfectly familiar to my ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either i must have known the abbot in former times or his voice bears a wonderful resemblance to that of some other to whom i have often listened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were certain tones which touched my very heart and made me feel sensations so singular that i strive in vain to account for my dearest mother it produced the same effect upon me yet certainly neither of us ever heard his voice till we came to madrid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suspect that what we attribute to his voice really proceeds from his pleasant manners which forbid our considering him as a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know not why but i feel more at my ease while conversing with him than i usually do with people who are unknown to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feared not to repeat to him all my childish thoughts and somehow i felt confident that he would hear my folly with indulgence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not deceived in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened to me with such an air of kindness and attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he answered me with such gentleness such condescension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not call me an infant and treat me with contempt as our cross old confessor at the castle used to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i verily believe that if i had lived in murcia a thousand years i never should have liked i confess that father dominic had not the most pleasing manners god grant my child that experience may not teach you to think them rare and precious i have found them but too much so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tell me antonia why is it impossible for me to have seen the because since the moment when he entered the abbey he has never been on the outside of its walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told me just now that from his ignorance of the streets he had some difficulty to find the all this is possible and still i may have seen him before he entered the abbey in order to come out it was rather necessary holy virgin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as you say that is very true.oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i recollect how it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was put into the abbey quite a child the common people say that he fell from heaven and was sent as a present to the capuchins by the that was very kind of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so he fell from heaven antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many do not credit this and i fancy my dear mother that i must number you among the unbelievers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed as our landlady told my aunt the general idea is that his parents being poor and unable to maintain him left him just born at the abbey door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the late superior from pure charity had him educated in the convent and he proved to be a model of virtue and piety and learning and i know not what else besides in consequence he was first received as a brother of the order and not long ago was chosen abbot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however whether this account or the other is the true one at least all agree that when the monks took him under their care he could not speak therefore you could not have heard his voice before he entered the monastery because at upon my word antonia you argue very closely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not suspect you of being so able a ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it delights me to see you in spirits besides you seem tranquil and easy and i hope that you will have no more convulsions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was sure the it has indeed done me good my child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has quieted my mind upon some points which agitated me and i already feel the effects of his attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my eyes grow heavy and i think i can sleep a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> draw the curtains my antonia but if i should antonia promised to obey her and having received her blessing drew the curtains of the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then seated herself in silence at her embroidery frame and beguiled the hours with building castles in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her spirits were enlivened by the evident change for the better in elvira and her fancy presented her with visions bright and pleasing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in these dreams ambrosio made no despicable figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought of him with joy and gratitude but for every idea which fell to the friars share at least two were unconsciously bestowed upon lorenzo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus passed the time till the bell in the neighbouring steeple of the capuchin cathedral announced the hour of midnight antonia remembered her mothers injunctions and obeyed them though with reluctance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she undrew the curtains with caution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elvira was enjoying a profound and quiet slumber her cheek glowed with healths returning colours a smile declared that her dreams were pleasant and as antonia bent over her she fancied that she heard her name pronounced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she kissed her mothers forehead softly and retired to her chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there she knelt before a statue of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rosolia her patroness she recommended herself to the protection of heaven and as had been her custom from infancy concluded her devotions by chaunting the following stanzas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now all is hushed the solemn chime no longer swells the nightly gale thy awful presence hour sublime with spotless heart once more i hail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis now the moment still and dread when sorcerers use their baleful power when graves give up their buried dead from guilt and guilty thoughts secure to duty and devotion true with bosom light and conscience pure repose thy gentle aid i woo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good angels take my thanks that still the snares of vice i view with scorn thanks that tonight as free from ill i sleep as when i woke at morn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet may not my unconscious breast harbour some guilt to me unknown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some wish impure which unreprest you blush to see and i to own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if such there be in gentle dream instruct my feet to shun the snare bid truth upon my errors beam and deign to make me still your care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chase from my peaceful bed away the witching spell a foe to rest the nightly goblin wanton fay let not the tempter in mine ear pour lessons of unhallowed joy let not the nightmare wandering near let not some horrid dream affright with strange fantastic forms mine eyes but rather bid some vision bright display the blissof yonder skies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> show me the crystal domes of heaven the worlds of light where angels lie shew me the lot to mortals given who guiltless live who guiltless die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then show me how a seat to gain amidst those blissful realms of air teach me to shun each guilty stain and guide me to the good and fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so every morn and night my voice to heaven the grateful strain shall raise in you as guardian powers rejoice so will i strive with zealous fire each vice to shun each fault correct will love the lessons you inspire and prize the virtues you protect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when at length by high command my body seeks the graves repose when death draws nigh with friendly hand pleased that my soul has scaped the wreck sighless will i my life resign and yield to god my spirit back as pure as when it first was mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having finished her usual devotions antonia retired to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sleep soon stole over her senses and for several hours she enjoyed that calm repose which innocence alone can know and for ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how dark these longextended realms and rueful wastes where nought but silence reigns and night dark night dark as was chaos ere the infant sun was rolled together or had tried its beams athwart the gloom profound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sickly taper by glimmering through thy lowbrowed misty vaults furred round with mouldy damps and ropy slime lets fall a supernumerary horror and only serves to make thy night more irksome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returned undiscovered to the abbey ambrosios mind was filled with the most pleasing images <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was wilfully blind to the danger of exposing himself to antonias charms he only remembered the pleasure which her society had afforded him and rejoiced in the prospect of that pleasure being repeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he failed not to profit by elviras indisposition to obtain a sight of her daughter every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first he bounded his wishes to inspire antonia with friendship but no sooner was he convinced that she felt that sentiment in its fullest extent than his aim became more decided and his attentions assumed a warmer colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the innocent familiarity with which she treated him encouraged his desires grown used to her modesty it no longer commanded the same respect and awe he still admired it but it only made him more anxious to deprive her of that quality which formed her principal charm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> warmth of passion and natural penetration of which latter unfortunately both for himself and antonia he possessed an ample share supplied a knowledge of the arts of seduction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he easily distinguished the emotions which were favourable to his designs and seized every means with avidity of infusing corruption into antonias bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this he found no easy matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> extreme simplicity prevented her from perceiving the aim to which the monks insinuations tended but the excellent morals which she owed to elviras care the solidity and correctness of her understanding and a strong sense of what was right implanted in her heart by nature made her feel that his precepts must be faulty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by a few simple words she frequently overthrew the whole bulk of his sophistical arguments and made him conscious how weak they were when opposed to virtue and truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on such occasion he took refuge in his eloquence he overpowered her with a torrent of philosophical paradoxes to which not understanding them it was impossible for her to reply and thus though he did not convince her that his reasoning was just he at least prevented her from discovering it to be false <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he perceived that her respect for his judgment augmented daily and doubted not with time to bring her to the point desired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not unconscious that his attempts were highly criminal he saw clearly the baseness of seducing the innocent girl but his passion was too violent to permit his abandoning his design <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolved to pursue it let the consequences be what they might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he depended upon finding antonia in some unguarded moment and seeing no other man admitted into her society nor hearing any mentioned either by her or by elvira he imagined that her young heart was still unoccupied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he waited for the opportunity of satisfying his unwarrantable lust every day increased his coldness for matilda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a little was this occasioned by the consciousness of his faults to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to hide them from her he was not sufficiently master of himself yet he dreaded lest in a transport of jealous rage she should betray the secret on which his character and even his life depended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda could not but remark his indifference he was conscious that she remarked it and fearing her reproaches shunned her studiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet when he could not avoid her her mildness might have convinced him that he had nothing to dread from her resentment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had resumed the character of the gentle interesting rosario she taxed him not with ingratitude but her eyes filled with involuntary tears and the soft melancholy of her countenance and voice uttered complaints far more touching than words could have conveyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio was not unmoved by her sorrow but unable to remove its cause he forbore to show that it affected him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as her conduct convinced him that he needed not fear her vengeance he continued to neglect her and avoided her company with care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> matilda saw that she in vain attempted to regain his affections yet she stifled the impulse of resentment and continued to treat her inconstant lover with her former fondness and attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees elviras constitution recovered itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was no longer troubled with convulsions and antonia ceased to tremble for her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio beheld this reestablishment with displeasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw that elviras knowledge of the world would not be the dupe of his sanctified demeanour and that she would easily perceive his views upon her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolved therefore before she quitted her chamber to try the extent of his influence over the innocent antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one evening when he had found elvira almost perfectly restored to health he quitted her earlier than was his usual custom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not finding antonia in the antichamber he ventured to follow her to her own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only separated from her mothers by a closet in which flora the waitingwoman generally slept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antonia sat upon a sopha with her back towards the door and read attentively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she heard not his approach till he had seated himself by her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she started and welcomed him with a look of pleasure then rising she would have conducted him to the sittingroom but ambrosio taking her hand obliged her by gentle violence to resume her place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she complied without difficulty she knew not that there was more impropriety in conversing with him in one room than another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought herself equally secure of his principles and her own and having replaced herself upon the sopha she began to prattle to him with her usual ease and vivacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he examined the book which she had been reading and had now placed upon the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the friar to himself antonia reads the bible and but upon a further inspection he found that elvira had made exactly the same remark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that prudent mother while she admired the beauties of the sacred writings was convinced that unrestricted no reading more improper could be permitted a young woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many of the narratives can only tend to excite ideas the worst calculated for a female breast every thing is called plainly and roundly by its name and the annals of a brothel would scarcely furnish a greater choice of indecent expressions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet this is the book which young women are recommended to study which is put into the hands of children able to comprehend little more than those passages of which they had better remain ignorant and which but too frequently inculcates the first rudiments of vice and gives the first alarm to the still sleeping passions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of this was elvira so fully convinced that she would have preferred putting into her daughters hands amadis de gaul or the valiant champion tirante the white and would sooner have authorised her studying the lewd exploits of don galaor or the lascivious jokes of the damsel plazer di mi vida <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had in consequence made two resolutions respecting the bible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first was that antonia should not read it till she was of an age to feel its beauties and profit by its morality the second that it should be copied out with her own hand and all improper passages either altered or omitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had adhered to this determination and such was the bible which antonia was reading it had been lately delivered to her and she perused it with an avidity with a delight that was inexpressible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio perceived his mistake and replaced the book upon the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antonia spoke of her mothers health with all the enthusiastic joy of a youthful heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i admire your filial affection said the abbot it proves the excellence and sensibility of your character it promises a treasure to him whom heaven has destined to possess your affections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the breast so capable of fondness for a parent what will it feel for a lover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay perhaps what feels it for one even now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me my lovely daughter have you known what it is to love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answer me with sincerity forget my habit and what it is to love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said she repeating his question oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes that is not what i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the love of which i speak can be felt only for one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you never seen the man whom you wished to be this was an untruth but she was unconscious of its falsehood she knew not the nature of her sentiments for lorenzo and never having seen him since his first visit to elvira with every day his image grew less feebly impressed upon her bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides she thought of an husband with all a virgins terror and negatived the friars demand without a moments hesitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and do you not long to see that man antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you feel no void in your heart which you fain would have filled up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you heave no sighs for the absence of some one dear to you but who that some one is you know not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perceive you not that what formerly could please has charms for you no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that a thousand new wishes new ideas new sensations have sprang in your bosom only to be felt never to be described <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or while you fill every other heart with passion is it possible that your own remains insensible and cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that melting eye that blushing cheek that enchanting voluptuous melancholy which at times overspreads your features all these marks belye your father you amaze me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is this love of which you speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i neither know its nature nor if i felt it why i should conceal have you seen no man antonia whom though never seen before you seemed long to have sought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whose form though a strangers was familiar to your eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sound of whose voice soothed you pleased you penetrated to your very soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in whose presence you rejoiced for whose absence you lamented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with whom your heart seemed to expand and in whose bosom with confidence unbounded you reposed the cares of your own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you not felt all this ambrosio started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarcely dared he credit his hearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried his eyes sparkling with delight and impatience while he seized her hand and pressed it rapturously even with more strength than you have described <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very moment that i beheld you i felt so pleased so interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i waited so eagerly to catch the sound of your voice and when i heard it it seemed so sweet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it spoke to me a language till then so unknown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> methought it told me a thousand things which i wished to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed as if i had long known you as if i had a right to your friendship your advice and your protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wept when you departed and longed for the time which should antonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed the monk and caught her to his bosom can i believe my senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeat it to me my sweet girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me again that you love me that you love me indeed i do let my mother be excepted and the world holds no at this frank avowal ambrosio no longer possessed himself wild with desire he clasped the blushing trembler in his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fastened his lips greedily upon hers sucked in her pure delicious breath violated with his bold hand the treasures of her bosom and wound around him her soft and yielding limbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> startled alarmed and confused at his action surprize at first deprived her of the power of resistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length recovering herself she strove to escape from his embrace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried release me for gods but the licentious monk heeded not her prayers he persisted in his design and proceeded to take still greater liberties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antonia prayed wept and struggled terrified to the extreme though at what she knew not she exerted all her strength to repulse the friar and was on the point of shrieking for assistance when the chamber door was suddenly thrown open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ambrosio had just sufficient presence of mind to be sensible of his danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reluctantly he quitted his prey and started hastily from the couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antonia uttered an exclamation of joy flew towards the door and found herself clasped in the arms of her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alarmed at some of the abbots speeches which antonia had innocently repeated elvira resolved to ascertain the truth of her suspicions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had known enough of mankind not to be imposed upon by the monks reputed virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reflected on several circumstances which though trifling on being put together seemed to authorize her fears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his frequent visits which as far as she could see were confined to her family his evident emotion whenever she spoke of antonia his being in the full prime and heat of manhood and above all his pernicious philosophy communicated to her by antonia and which accorded but ill with his conversation in her presence all these circumstances inspired her with doubts respecting the purity of ambrosios friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in consequence she resolved when he should next be alone with antonia to endeavour at surprizing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis true that when she entered the room he had already abandoned his prey but the disorder of her daughters dress and the shame and confusion stamped upon the friars countenance sufficed to prove that her suspicions were but too wellfounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however she was too prudent to make those suspicions known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she judged that to unmask the imposter would be no easy matter the public being so much prejudiced in his favour and having but few friends she thought it dangerous to make herself so powerful an enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she affected therefore not to remark his agitation seated herself tranquilly upon the sopha assigned some trifling reason for having quitted her room unexpectedly and conversed on various subjects with seeming confidence and ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anything fell off that log it would be of no further value even to the curiosity seeker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got over all the horses save tunemah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he refused to consider it nor did peaceful argument win <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he was more or less of a fool we did not take this as a reflection on our judgment but culled cedar clubs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we beat him until we were ashamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we put a slipnoose about his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot and i stood on the log and heaved while wes stood on the shore and pushed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly it occurred to me that if tunemah made up his silly mind to come he would probably do it all at once in which case the tenderfoot and i would have about as much show for life as fossil formations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt say anything about it to the tenderfoot but i hitched my sixshooter around to the front resolved to find out how good i was at wingshooting horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tunemah declared he would die for his convictions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all right said we die then with the embellishment of profanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we stripped him naked and stoned him into the raging stream where he had one chance in three of coming through alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might as well be dead as on the other side of that stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he won through however and now i believe hed tackle a tight rope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of such is the trail of such its wonders its pleasures its little comforts its annoyances its dangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when you are forced to draw your sixshooter to end mercifully the life of an animal that has served you faithfully but that has fallen victim to the leg breaking hazard of the way then you know a little of its tragedy also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may you never know the greater tragedy when a mans life goes out and you unable to help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may always your trail lead through fine trees green grasses fragrant flowers and pleasant waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once i happened to be sitting out a dance with a tactful young girl of tender disposition who thought she should adapt her conversation to the one with whom she happened to be talking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore she asked questions concerning outofdoors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew nothing whatever about it but she gave a very good imitation of one interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some occult reason people never seem to expect me to own evening clothes or to know how to dance or to be able to talk about anything civilized in fact most of them appear disappointed that i do not pull off a warjig in the middle of the drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this young girl selected deer as her topic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she mentioned liquid eyes beautiful form slender ears she said cute and darlings and perfect dears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i dont see how you can ever bear to shoot them mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you quarter the onions and slice them very thin said i dreamily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you take a little bacon fat you had left over from the flapjacks and put it in the fryingpan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fryingpan should be very hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the onions are frying you must keep turning them over with a fork <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its rather difficult to get them all browned without burning some <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a broiler is handy but two willows peeled and charred a little so the willow taste wont penetrate the meat will do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sear it well at first in order to keep the juices in then cook rather slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it is done put it on a hot plate and pour the browned onions bacon fat and all over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im telling you why i can bear to shoot deer said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont see said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well suppose youve been climbing a mountain late in the afternoon when the sun is on the other side of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a mountain of big boulders loose little stones thorny bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slightest misstep would send pebbles rattling brush rustling but you have gone all the way without making that misstep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it means that youve known all about every footstep youve taken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be business enough for most people wouldnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in addition youve managed to see everything on that side of the mountain especially patches of brown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve seen lots of patches of brown and youve examined each one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides that youve heard lots of little rustlings and youve identified each one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to do all these things well keys your nerves to a high tension doesnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then near the top you look up from your last noiseless step to see in the brush a very dim patch of brown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you hadnt been looking so hard you surely wouldnt have made it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps if youre not humbleminded you may reflect that most people wouldnt have seen it at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the patch of brown defines itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your heart gives one big jump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know that you have but the briefest moment the tiniest fraction of time to hold the white bead of your rifle motionless and to press the trigger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has to be done very steadily at that distanceand you out of breath with your nerves keyed high in the tension of such caution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now what are you talking about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was telling you why i could bear to shoot deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course not i reassured her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reason i can bear to kill deer is because to kill deer you must accomplish a skillful elimination of the obvious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my young lady was evidently afraid of being considered stupid and also convinced of her inability to understand what i was driving at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she temporized in the manner of society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see she said with an air of complete enlightenment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now of course she did not see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody could see the force of that last remark without the grace of further explanation and yet in the elimination of the obvious rests the whole secret of seeing deer in the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in traveling the trail you will notice two things that a tenderfoot will habitually contemplate the horn of his saddle or the trail a few yards ahead of his horses nose with occasionally a look about at the landscape and the oldtimer will be constantly searching the prospect with keen understanding eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now in the occasional glances the tenderfoot takes his perceptions have room for just so many impressions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the number is filled out he sees nothing more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally the obvious features of the landscape supply the basis for these impressions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sees the configuration of the mountains the nature of their covering the course of their ravines first of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then if he looks more closely there catches his eye an odd shaped rock a burned black stub a flowering bush or some such matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything less striking in its appeal to the attention actually has not room for its recognition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in other words supposing that a man has the natural ability to receive x visual impressions the tenderfoot fills out his full capacity with the striking features of his surroundings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be able to see anything more obscure in form or color he must naturally put aside from his attention some one or another of these obvious features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can for example look for a particular kind of flower on a side hill only by refusing to see other kinds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if this is plain then go one step further in the logic of that reasoning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put yourself in the mental attitude of a man looking for deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eye sweeps rapidly over a side hill so rapidly that you cannot understand how he can have gathered the main features of that hill let alone concentrate and refine his attention to the seeing of an animal under a bush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a matter of fact he pays no attention to the main features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has trained his eye not so much to see things as to leave things out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the oddshaped rock the charred stub the bright flowering bush do not exist for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eye passes over them as unseeing as yours over the patch of brown or gray that represents his quarry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his attention stops on the unusual just as does yours only in his case the unusual is not the obvious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has succeeded by long training in eliminating that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore he sees deer where you do not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as you can forget the naturally obvious and construct an artificially obvious then you too will see deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these animals are strangely invisible to the untrained eye even when they are standing in plain sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can look straight at them and not see them at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then some old woodsman lets you sight over his finger exactly to the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once the figure of the deer fairly leaps into vision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know of no more perfect example of the instantaneous than this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are filled with astonishment that you could for a moment have avoided seeing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet next time you will in all probability repeat just this puzzle picture experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot tried for six weeks before he caught sight of one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time and again one or the other of us would hiss back see the deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over there by the yellow bush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before he could bring the deliberation of his scrutiny to the point of identification the deer would be gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once a fawn jumped fairly within ten feet of the packhorses and went bounding away through the bushes and that fawn he could not help seeing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we tried conscientiously enough to get him a shot but the tenderfoot was unable to move through the brush less majestically than a pullman car so we had ended by becoming apathetic on the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally while descending a very abrupt mountain side i made out a buck lying down perhaps three hundred feet directly below us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the buck was not looking our way so i had time to call the tenderfoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with difficulty and by using my riflebarrel as a pointer i managed to show him the animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately he began to pant as though at the finish of a mile race and his rifle when he leveled it covered a good half acre of ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lowered his weapon to stare at me wildeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now shoot i advised and aim at his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deer was now on his feet and facing us so the tenderfoot had the entire length of the animal to allow for lineal variation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot thrust his hat over one eye rested hand on hip in a manner cocky to behold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bullet had broken the deers backabout six inches from the tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot had overshot by at least three feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will see many deer thus from the trailin fact we kept up our meat supply from the saddle as one might saybut to enjoy the finer savor of seeing deer you should start out definitely with that object in view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus you have opportunity for the display of a certain finer woodcraft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must know where the objects of your search are likely to be found and that depends on the time of year the time of days their age their sex a hundred little things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the bucks carry antlers in the velvet they frequent the inaccessibilities of the highest rocky peaks so their tender horns may not be torn in the brush but nevertheless so that the advantage of a lofty viewpoint may compensate for the loss of cover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later you will find them in the open slopes of a lower altitude fully exposed to the sun that there the heat may harden the antlers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later still the heads in fine condition and tough to withstand scratches they plunge into the dense thickets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the mean time the fertile does have sought a lower country with patches of small brush interspersed with open passages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they can feed with their fawns completely concealed but able by merely raising the head to survey the entire landscape for the threatening of danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the barren does on the other hand you will find through the timber and brush for they are careless of all responsibilities either to offspring or headgear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are but a few of the considerations you will take into account a very few of the many which lend the deer countries strange thrills of delight over new knowledge gained over crafty expedients invented or well utilized over the satisfactory matching of your reason your instinct your subtlety and skill against the reason instinct subtlety and skill of one of the wariest of large wild animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perversely enough the times when you did not see deer are more apt to remain vivid in your memory than the times when you did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can still see distinctly sundry wide jumpmarks where the animal i was tracking had evidently caught sight of me and lit out before i came up to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> equally sundry little thin disappearing clouds of dust cracklings of brush growing ever more distant the tops of bushes waving to the steady passage of something remaining persistently concealedthese are the chief ingredients often repeated which make up deerstalking memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i think of seeing deer these things automatically rise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few of the deer actually seen do however stand out clearly from the many <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i was a very small boy possessed of a rifle and large ambitions i followed the advantage my fathers footsteps made me in the deep snow of an unused loggingroad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his attention was focused on some very interesting fresh tracks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i being a small boy cared not at all for tracks and so saw a big doe emerge from the bushes not ten yards away lope leisurely across the road and disappear wagging earnestly her tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i had recovered my breath i vehemently demanded the sense of fooling with tracks when there were real live deer to be had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well why didnt you shoot her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the spring of i was at the head of the piant river waiting for the logdrive to start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one morning happening to walk over a slashing of many years before in which had grown a strong thicket of white popples i jumped a band of nine deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall never forget the bewildering impression made by the glancing dodging bouncing white of those nine snowy tails and rumps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but most wonderful of all was a great buck of i should be afraid to say how many points that stood silhouetted on the extreme end of a ridge high above our camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time was just after twilight and as we watched the sky lightened behind him in prophecy of the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot is a queer beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he makes more trouble than ants at a picnic more work than a trespassing goat he never sees anything knows where anything is remembers accurately your instructions follows them if remembered or is able to handle without awkwardness his large and pathetic hands and feet he is always lost always falling off or into things always in difficulties his articles of necessity are constantly being burned up or washed away or mislaid he looks at you beamingly through great innocent eyes in the most chuckleheaded of manners he exasperates you to within an inch of explosionand yet you love him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am referring now to the real tenderfoot the fellow who cannot learn who is incapable ever of adjusting himself to the demands of the wild life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes a man is merely green inexperienced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but give him a chance and he soon picks up the game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is your greenhorn not your tenderfoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down near monache meadows we came across an individual leading an old packmare up the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing he asked us to tell him where he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we noticed that he carried his gun muzzleup in his hippocket which seemed to be a nice way to shoot a hole in your hand but a poor way to make your weapon accessible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he unpacked near us and promptly turned the mare into a boghole because it looked green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he stood around the rest of the evening and talked deprecating talk of a garrulous nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stranger gave us a hazy account of misnamed canons by which we gathered that he had come directly over the rough divide below us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you wanted to get to monache why didnt you go around to the eastward through that pass there and save yourself all the climb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must have been pretty rough through there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stilli got lots of timei can take all summer if i want to and id rather stick to a straight linethen you know where you areif you get off the straight line youre likely to get lost you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we knew well enough what ailed him of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a tenderfoot of the sort that always to its dying day unhobbles its horses before putting their halters on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet that man for thirtytwo years had lived almost constantly in the wild countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had traveled more miles with a packtrain than we shall ever dream of traveling and hardly could we mention a famous camp of the last quarter century that he had not blundered into <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover he proved by the indirections of his misinformation that he had really been there and was not making ghost stories in order to impress us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet if the lord spares him thirtytwo years more at the end of that time he will probably still be carrying his gun upside down turning his horse into a boghole and blundering through the country by main strength and awkwardness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a beautiful type of the tenderfoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the redeeming point of the tenderfoot is his humbleness of spirit and his extreme good nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exasperates you with his fool performances to the point of dancing cursing wild crying rage and then accepts yourwell reproofsso meekly that you come off the boil as though some one had removed you from the fire and you feel like a lowbrowed thug <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose your particular tenderfoot to be named algernon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose him to have packed his horse looselythey always doso that the pack has slipped the horse has bucked over three square miles of assorted mountains and the rest of the train is scattered over identically that area <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have run your saddlehorse to a lather heading the outfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have sworn and dodged and scrambled and yelled even fired your sixshooter to turn them and bunch them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the mean time algernon has either sat his horse like a park policeman in his leisure hours or has ambled directly into your path of pursuit on an average of five times a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the trouble dies from the landscape and the baby bewilderment from his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you slip from your winded horse and address algernon with elaborate courtesy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear fellow you remark did you not see that the thing for you to do was to head them down by the bottom of that little gulch there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you really think anybody would have seen it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what in hades do you think i wanted to run my horse all through those boulders for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think i want to get him lame way up here in the hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mind telling a man a thing once but to tell it to him fiftyeight times and then have it do no good have you the faintest recollection of my instructing you to turn the bight over instead of under when you throw that packhitch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youd remember that we shouldnt have had all this trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt tell me to head them by the little gulch babbles algernon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is just the utterly fool reply that upsets your artificial and elaborate courtesy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you probably foam at the mouth and dance on your hat and shriek wild imploring imprecations to the astonished hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is not because you have an unfortunate disposition but because algernon has been doing precisely the same thing for two months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why you ganglelegged bugeyed softhanded pop eared tenderfoot you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some things you never think of telling a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never told you to open your mouth to spit either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you had a hired man at five dollars a year who was so allaround hopelessly thickheaded and incompetent as you are youd fire him tomorrow morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then algernon looks truly sorry and doesnt answer back as he ought to in order to give occasion for the relief of a really soulsatisfying scrap and utters the soft answer humbly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so your wrath is turned and there remain only the dregs which taste like some of algernons cooking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is rather good fun to relieve the bitterness of the heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me tell you a few more tales of the tenderfoot premising always that i love him and when at home seek him out to smoke pipes at his fireside to yarn over the trail to wonder how much rancor he cherishes against the maniacs who declaimed against him and by way of compensation to build up in the mind of his sweetheart his wife or his mother a fearful and wonderful reputation for him as the terror of the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these tales are selected from many mere samples of a varied experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they occurred here there and everywhere and at various times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let no one try to lay them at the door of our tenderfoot merely because such is his title in this narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we called him that by way of distinction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once upon a time some of us were engaged in climbing a mountain rising some five thousand feet above our startingplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we toiled along one of the packhorses became impatient and pushed ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we did not mind that especially as long as she stayed in sight but in a little while the trail was closed in by brush and timber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> algernon said we just push on and get ahead of that mare will you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trail was steep and rather bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the labor was strenuous and we checked off each thousand feet with thankfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we saw nothing further of algernon we naturally concluded he had headed the mare and was continuing on the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then through a little opening we saw him riding cheerfully along without a care to occupy his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just for luck we hailed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well youd better push on a little faster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she may leave the trail at the summit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then one of us endowed by heaven with a keen intuitive instinct for tenderfeetno one could have a knowledge of them they are too unexpectedhad an inspiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose there are tracks on the trail ahead of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stared at each other then at the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only one horse had preceded usthat of the tenderfoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of course algernon was nevertheless due for his chuckleheaded reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that raised the storm conventional to such an occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what in the name of seventeen little dickybirds did you think you were up to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were you going to ride ahead until dark in the childlike faith that that mare might show up somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres a nice state of affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trail is all tracked up now with our horses and heaven knows whether shes left tracks where she turned off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we tied the animals savagely and started back on foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be criminal to ask our saddlehorses to repeat that climb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> algernon we ordered to stay with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dont stir from them no matter what happens or youll get lost we commanded out of the wisdom of long experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we climbed down the four thousand odd feet and then back again leading the mare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had turned off not forty rods from where algernon had taken up her pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your algernon never does get down to little details like trackshis scheme of life is much too magnificent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be sure he would not know fresh tracks from old if he should see them so it is probably quite as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning he goes out after the horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bunch he finds easily enough but one is missing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would you do about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would naturally walk in a circle around the bunch until you crossed the track of the truant leading away from it wouldnt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you made a wide enough circle you would inevitably cross that track wouldnt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> provided the horse started out with the bunch in the first place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you would follow the track catch the horse and bring him back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says he old brownie is missing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he maunders off into the scenery trusting to high heaven that he is going to blunder against brownie as a prominent feature of the landscape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a couple of hours you probably saddle up brownie and go out to find the tenderfoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has a horrifying facility in losing himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing is more cheering than to arise from a hard earned couch of ease for the purpose of trailing an algernon or so through the gathering dusk to the spot where he has managed to find somethinga very real despair of ever getting back to food and warmth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing is more irritating then than his gratitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i traveled once in the black hills with such a tenderfoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were off from the base of supplies for a ten days trip with only a saddlehorse apiece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was near first principles as our total provisions consisted of two pounds of oatmeal some tea and sugar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among other things we climbed mt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trail after we left the horses was as plain as a strip of brussels carpet but somehow or another that tenderfoot managed to get off it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we gained the top watched the sunset and started down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot i thought was fairly at my coattails but when i turned to speak to him he had gone he must have turned off at one of the numerous little openings in the brush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by away down the west slope of the mountain i heard a shot and a faint a very faint despairing yell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after various signals of the sort it became evident that the tenderfoot was approaching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment he tore by at full speed his hat off his eye wild his sixshooter popping at every jump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he passed within six feet of me and never saw me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> subsequently i left him on the prairie with accurate and simple instructions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you simply keep that to your left and ride eight hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those hills stick out like a sore thumb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two days later he drifted into rapid city having wandered off somewhere to the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he had done it i can never guess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot is always in hard luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apparently too by all tests of analysis it is nothing but luck pure chance misfortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet the very persistence of it in his case where another escapes perhaps indicates that much of what we call good luck is in reality unconscious skill in the arrangement of those elements which go to make up events <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a persistently unlucky man is perhaps sometimes to be pitied but more often to be booted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that philosophy will be cryingly unjust about once in ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lucky or unlucky the tenderfoot is human <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ordinarily that doesnt occur to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a malevolent engine of destructionquite as impersonal as heat or cold or lack of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is an unfortunate article of personal belonging requiring much looking after to keep in order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a credulous and convenient response to practical jokes huge tales misinformation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a laudable object of attrition for the development of your character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but somehow in the woods he is not as other men and so you do not come to feel yourself in close human relations to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has feelings even if you do not respect them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has his little enjoyments even though he does rarely contemplate anything but the horn of his saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> algernon you cry for heavens sake stick that saddle of yours in a glass case and glut yourself with the sight of its ravishing beauties next winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the present do gaze on the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has doubtless a full range of all the appreciative emotions though from his actions youd never suspect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most human of all he possesses his little vanities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> algernon always overdoes the equipment question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it is birdshooting he accumulates leggings and canvas caps and belts and dogwhistles and things until he looks like a picture from a departmentstore catalogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the cow country he wears stetson hats snake bands red handkerchiefs sixshooters chaps and huge spurs that do not match his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it is yachting he has a chronometer with a gong in the cabin of a fiveton sailboat possesses a nickleplated machine to register the heel of his craft sports a brassbound yachtingcap and all the regalia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i never could understand his insane desire to get sunburned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man will get sunburned fast enough he could not help it if he would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> algernon usually starts out from town without a hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he dares not take off his sweater for a week lest it carry away his entire face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen men with deep sores on their shoulders caused by nothing but excessive burning in the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it means quite simply that algernon realizes his inner deficiencies and wants to make up for them by the outward seeming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be kind to him for he has been raised a pet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot is lovablemysterious in how he does itand awfully unexpected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day we tied our horses to three bushes and walked on foot two hundred yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was nearly four thousand feet down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you realize how far that is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a river meandering through olivecolored forests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so distant that it was light green and as narrow as a piece of tape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there were rapids but so remote that we could not distinguish the motion of them only the color <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white resembled tiny dabs of cotton wool stuck on the tape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it turned and twisted following the turns and twists of the canon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow the level at the bottom resembled less forests and meadows than a heavy and sluggish fluid like molasses flowing between the canon walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it emerged from the bend of a sheer cliff ten miles to eastward it disappeared placidly around the bend of another sheer cliff an equal distance to the westward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we watched the shadow of the canon wall darkened the valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the upper air of which we were dwellers for the moment was peopled by giants and clear atmosphere and glittering sunlight flashing like silver and steel and precious stones from the granite domes peaks minarets and palisades of the high sierras <end> <end> 
<start> <start> solid as they were in reality in the crispness of this mountain air under the tangible blue of this mountain sky they seemed to poise light as so many balloons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of them rose sheer with hardly a fissure some had flung across their shoulders long trailing pine draperies fine as fur others matched mantles of the whitest white against the bluest blue of the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards the lower country were more pines rising in ridges like the fur of an animal that has been alarmed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dangled our feet over the edge and talked about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wes pointed to the upper end where the sluggish lavalike flow of the canonbed first came into view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats where well camp said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we get there he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this canon lies in the heart of the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who would visit it have first to get into the countrya matter of over a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they have their choice of three probabilities of destruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first route comprehends two final days of travel at an altitude of about ten thousand feet where the snow lies in midsummer where there is no feed no comfort and the way is strewn with the bones of horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is known as the basin trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after taking it you prefer the othersuntil you try them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the finish of the second route is directly over the summit of a mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you climb two thousand feet and then drop down five <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ascent is heart breaking but safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the descent is hairraising and unsafe no profanity can do justice to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of a packtrain of thirty mules nine were lost in the course of that five thousand feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> legend has it that once many years ago certain prospectors took in a chinese cook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first the mongolian bewailed his fate loudly and fluently but later settled to a single terrified moan that sounded like tunemah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trail was therefore named the tune mah trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is said that tunemah is the very worst single vituperation of which the chinese language is capable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third route is called hells half mile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus like paradise the canon is guarded but like paradise it is wondrous in delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for when you descend you find that the tapewide trickle of water seen from above has become a river with profound darkling pools and placid stretches and swift dashing rapids that the dark green sluggish flow in the canonbed has disintegrated into a noble forest with great pinetrees and shaded aisles and deep dank thickets and brush openings where the sun is warm and the birds are cheerful and groves of cottonwoods where all day long softly like snow the flakes of cotton float down through the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover there are meadows spacious lawns opening out closing in winding here and there through the groves in the manner of spilled naphtha actually waist high with green feed sown with flowers like a brocade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quaint tributary little brooks babble and murmur down through these trees down through these lawns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a blessed warm sun hums with the joy of innumerable bees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to right hand and to left in front of you and behind rising sheer forbidding impregnable the cliffs mountains and ranges hem you in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down the river ten miles you can go then the gorge closes the river grows savage you can only look down the tumbling fierce waters and turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up the river five miles you can go then interpose the sheer snowclad cliffs of the palisades and them rising a matter of fourteen thousand feet you may not cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are shut in your paradise as completely as though surrounded by iron bars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but too the world is shut out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in it are trout and deer and grouse and bear and lazy happy days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your horses feed to the fatness of butter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wander at will in the ample though definite limits of your domain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you lie on your back and examine dispassionately with an interest entirely detached the huge cliffwalls of the valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really it needs at least an angel with a flaming sword to force you to move on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we turned away from our view and addressed ourselves to the task of finding out just when we were going to get there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first day we bobbed up and over innumerable little ridges of a few hundred feet elevation crossed several streams and skirted the wide bowllike amphitheatre of a basin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second day we climbed over things and finally ended in a small hanging park named alpine meadows at an elevation of eight thousand five hundred feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there we restedover a day camped under a single pine tree with the quickgrowing mountain grasses thick about us a semicircle of mountains on three sides and the plunge into the canon on the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we needed meat we spent part of the day in finding a deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the time we watched idly for bear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will often go twenty miles overnight apparently for the sheer delight of being on the move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also are they exceedingly loath to expend unnecessary energy in getting to places and they hate to go down steep hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see their fore legs are short <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore they are skilled in the choice of easy routes through the mountains and once having made the choice they stick to it until through certain narrow places on the route selected they have worn a trail as smooth as a gardenpath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old prospectors used quite occasionally to pick out the horsepasses by trusting in general to the bear migrations and many a welltraveled route of today is superimposed over the waythrough picked out by old bruin long ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of such was our own trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore we kept our rifles at hand and our eyes open for a straggler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but none came though we baited craftily with portions of our deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all we gained was a rattlesnake and he seemed a bit out of place so high up in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mount tunemah stood over against us still twentytwo hundred feet above our elevation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we gazed on it sadly for directly by its summit and for five hours beyond lay our trail and evil of reputation was that trail beyond all others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the horses as we bunched them in preparation for the packing took on a new interest for it was on the cards that the unpacking at evening would find some missing from the ranks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lilys a goner sure said wes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how shes got this far except by drunken mans luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and tunemah himself pointed out the tenderfoot naming his own fool horse i see where i start in to walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sort of a morituri te salutamur said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we climbed the two thousand two hundred feet leading our saddlehorses to save their strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every twenty feet we rested breathing heavily of the rarified air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then at the top of the world we paused on the brink of nothing to tighten cinches while the cold wind swept by us the snow glittered in a sunlight become silvery like that of early april and the giant peaks of the high sierras lifted into a distance inconceivably remote as though the horizon had been set back for their accommodation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to our left lay a windrow of snow such as you will see drifted into a sharp crest across a corner of your yard only this windrow was twenty feet high and packed solid by the sun the wind and the weight of its age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we climbed it and looked over directly into the eye of a round alpine lake seven or eight hundred feet below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was of an intense cobalt blue a color to be seen only in these glacial bodies of water deep and rich as the mantle of a merchant of tyre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the savage fierce granite needles and knifeedges of the mountain crest hemmed it about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this was temporizing and we knew it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first drop of the trail was so steep that we could flip a pebble to the first level of it and so rough in its waterandsnowgouged knuckles of rocks that it seemed that at the first step a horse must necessarily fall end over end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we made it successfully however and breathed deep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even lily by a miracle of lucky scrambling did not even stumble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now shes easy for a little ways said wes then well get busy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we got busy we took our guns in our hands to preserve them from a fall and started in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two more miracles saved dinkey at two more places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we spent an hour at one spot and finally built a new trail around it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six times a minute we held our breaths and stood on tiptoe with anxiety powerless to help while the horse did his best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the especially bad places we checked them off one after another congratulating ourselves on so much saved as each came across without accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when there were no bad places the trail was so extraordinarily steep that we ahead were in constant dread of a horses falling on us from behind and our legs did become wearied to incipient paralysis by the constant stiff checking of the descent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover every second or so one of the big loose stones with which the trail was cumbered would be dislodged and come bouncing down among us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dodged and swore the horses kicked we all feared for the integrity of our legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day was full of an intense nervous strain an entire absorption in the precise present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we promptly forgot a difficulty as soon as we were by it we had not time to think of those still ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all outside the insistence of the moment was blurred and unimportant like a specialized focus so i cannot tell you much about the scenery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only outside impression we received was that the canon floor was slowly rising to meet us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then strangely enough as it seemed we stepped off to level ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had made five miles in a little under seven hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remained only the crossing of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was no mean task but we accomplished it lightly searching out a ford <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were high grasses and on the other side of them a grove of very tall cottonwoods clean as a park <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first of all we cooked things then we spread things then we lay on our backs and smoked things our hands clasped back of our heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cocked ironical eyes at the sheer cliff of old mount tunemah very much as a man would cock his eye at a tiger in a cage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already the meathawks the fluffy canada jays had found us out and were prepared to swoop down boldly on whatever offered to their predatory skill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had nothing for them yetthere were no remains of the lunchbut the fireirons were out and ribs of venison were roasting slowly over the coals in preparation for the evening meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> directly opposite visible through the lattice of the trees were two huge mountain peaks part of the wall that shut us in over against us in a height we had not dared ascribe to the sky itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by the shadow of these mountains rose on the westerly wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it crept up at first slowly extinguishing color afterwards more rapidly as the sun approached the horizon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moments gray intervened and then the wonderful golden afterglow laid on the peaks its enchantment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little by little that too faded until at last far away through a rift in the ranks of the giants but one remained gilded by the glory of a dream that continued with it after the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heretofore it had seemed to us an insignificant peak apparently overtopped by many but by this token we knew it to be the highest of them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then ensued another pause as though to give the invisible sceneshifter time to accomplish his work followed by a shower of evening coolness that seemed to sift through the trees like a soft and gentle rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we ate again by the flicker of the fire dabbing a trifle uncertainly at the food wondering at the distant mountain on which the day had made its final stand shrinking a little before the stealthy dark that flowed down the canon in the manner of a heavy smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the notch between the two huge mountains blazed a staraccurately in the notch like the front sight of a rifle sighted into the marvelous depths of space <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first we knew of it when it touched the crest of our two mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night has strange effects on the hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment before they had menaced black and sullen against the sky but at the touch of the moon their very substance seemed to dissolve leaving in the upper atmosphere the airiest most nebulous fragile ghostly simulacrums of themselves you could imagine in the realms of fairyland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed actually to float to poise like cloudshapes about to dissolve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and against them were cast the inky silhouettes of three firtrees in the shadow near at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down over the stones rolled the river crying out to us with the voices of old accustomed friends in another wilderness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i have said a river flows through the canon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a very good river with some riffles that can be waded down to the edges of black pools or white chutes of water with appropriate big trees fallen slantwise into it to form deep holes and with hurrying smooth stretches of some breadth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all of these various places are rainbow trout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no use fishing until late afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clear sun of the high altitudes searches out mercilessly the bottom of the stream throwing its miniature boulders mountains and valleys as plainly into relief as the buttes of arizona at noon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there if you walk far enough and climb hard enough over all sorts of obstructions you may discover a few spots shaded by big trees or rocks where you can pick up a half dozen fish but it is slow work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when however the shadow of the two huge mountains feels its way across the stream then as though a signal had been given the trout begin to rise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an hour and a half there is noble sport indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stream fairly swarmed with them but of course some places were better than others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the upper reaches the water boiled like seltzer around the base of a tremendous tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there the pool was at least ten feet deep and shot with bubbles throughout the whole of its depth but it was full of fish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they rose eagerly to your gyrating flyand took it away with them down to subaqueous chambers and passages among the roots of that tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after which you broke your leader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> royal coachman was the best lure and therefore valuable exceedingly were royal coachmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever we lost one we lifted up our voices in lament and went away from there calling to mind that there were other pools many other pools free of obstruction and with fish in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet such is the perversity of fishermen we were back losing more royal coachmen the very next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all i managed to disengage just three rather small trout from that pool and in return decorated their ancestral halls with festoons of leaders and the brilliance of many flies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all you had to do was to walk through a grove of cottonwoods over a brook through another grove of pines down a sloping meadow to where one of the gigantic pinetrees had obligingly spanned the current <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you crossed that traversed another meadow broke through a thicket slid down a steep grassy bank and there you were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great many years before a pinetree had fallen across the current <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now its whitened skeleton lay there opposing a barrier for about twentyfive feet out into the stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the water turned aside of course and boiled frantically around the end as though trying to catch up with the rest of the stream which had gone on without it but some of it dived down under and came up on the other side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there as though bewildered it paused in an uneasy pool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its constant action had excavated a very deep hole the debris of which had formed a bar immediately below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you waded out on the bar and cast along the length of the pine skeleton over the pool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you were methodical you first shortened your line and began near the bank gradually working out until you were casting fortyfive feet to the very edge of the fast current <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know of nothing pleasanter for you to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see the evening shadow was across the river and a beautiful grass slope at your back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over the way was a grove of trees whose birds were very busy because it was near their sunset while towering over them were mountains quite peaceful by way of contrast because their sunset was still far distant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the river was in a great hurry and was talking to itself like a man who has been detained and is now at last making up time to his important engagement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from the deep black shadow beneath the pine skeleton occasionally flashed white bodies that made concentric circles where they broke the surface of the water and which fought you to a finish in the glory of battle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the casting was against the current so your flies could rest but the briefest possible moment on the surface of the stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> day after day you could catch your required number from an apparently inexhaustible supply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might inform you further of the gorge downstream where you lie flat on your stomach ten feet above the river and with one hand cautiously extended over the edge cast accurately into the angle of the cliff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when you get your strike you tow him downstream clamber precariously to the waters levelstill playing your fishand there land himif he has accommodatingly stayed hooked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a threepound fish will make you a lot of tribulation at this game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we lived on fish and venison and had all we wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beartrails were plenty enough and the signs were comparatively fresh but at the time of our visit the animals themselves had gone over the mountains on some sort of a picnic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grouse too were numerous in the popple thickets and flushed much like our ruffed grouse of the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they afforded firstrate wingshooting for surepop the little shotgun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but these things occupied after all only a small part of every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had loads of time left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course we explored the valley up and down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one always does in a permanent camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> activeor rather restless interest in life seemed to die away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither we nor they had to rustle hard for food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they became fastidious in their choice and at all times of day could be seen sauntering in indian file from one part of the meadow to the other for the sole purpose apparently of cropping a half dozen indifferent mouthfuls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the time they roosted under trees one hind leg relaxed their eyes half closed their ears wabbling the pictures of imbecile content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were very much the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course we had our outbursts of virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while under their influence we undertook vast works <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after their influence had died out we found ourselves with said vast works on our hands and so came to cursing ourselves and our fool spasms of industry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance wes and i decided to make buckskin from the hide of the latest deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we did not need the buckskinwe already had two in the pack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our ordinary procedure would have been to dry the hide for future treatment by a mexican at a dollar a hide when we should have returned home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as i said we were afflicted by sporadic activity and wanted to do something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we began with great ingenuity by constructing a grainingtool out of a tableknife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we bound it with rawhide and encased it with wood and wrapped it with cloth and filed its edge square across as is proper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after this we hunted out a very smooth barkless log laid the hide across it straddled it and began graining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you grasp the tool by either end hold the square edge at a certain angle and push away from you mightily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a half dozen pushes will remove a little patch of hair twice as many more will scrape away half as much of the sealbrown grain exposing the white of the hide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then if you want to you can stop and establish in your mind a definite proportion between the amount thus exposed the area remaining unexposed and the muscular fatigue of these dozen and a half of mighty pushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have left out of account the fact that you are going to get almighty sick of the job that your arms and upper back are going to ache shrewdly before you are done and that as you go on it is going to be increasingly difficult to hold down the edges firmly enough to offer the required resistance to your knife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besidesif you get carelessyoull scrape too hard hence little holes in the completed buckskin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alsoif you get carelessyou will probably leave the finest tiniest shreds of grain and each of them means a hard transparent spot in the product <end> <end> 
<start> <start> furthermore once having started in on the job you are like the little boy who caught the trolley you cannot let go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be finished immediately all at one heat before the hide stiffens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be it understood your first enthusiasm has evaporated and you are thinking of fifty pleasant things you might just as well be doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next you revel in greaselard oil if you have it if not then lard or the product of boiled brains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this you must rub into the skin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you rub it in until you suspect that your fingernails have worn away and you glisten to the elbows like an eskimo cutting blubber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the merciful arrangement of those who invented buckskin this entitles you to a rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you take itfor several daysuntil your conscience seizes you by the scruff of the neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you transport gingerly that slippery clammy soggy snaky cold bundle of greasy horror to the bank of the creek and there for endless hours you wash it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grease is more reluctant to enter the stream than you are in the early morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others go by on their way to the troutpools but you are chained to the stake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by you straighten your back with creaks and walk home like a stiff old man carrying your hide rid of all superfluous oil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then if you are just learning how your instructor examines the result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats all right says he cheerfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now when it dries it will be buckskin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for during the process of drying it must be your pastime constantly to pull and stretch at every square inch of that boundless skin in order to loosen all the fibres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> otherwise it would dry as stiff as whalebone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there is nothing on earth that seems to dry slower than buckskin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wear your fingers down to the first joints and wishing to preserve the remainder for future use you carry the hide to your instructor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just beginning to dry nicely says he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you go back and do it some more putting the entire strength of your body soul and religious convictions into the stretching of that buckskin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looks as white as paper and feels as soft and warm as the turf on a southern slope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless your tyrant declares it will not do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looks dry and it feels dry says he but it isnt dry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at this point your outraged soul arches its back and bucks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you sneak off and roll up that piece of buckskin and thrust it into the alforja <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with a deep sigh of relief you come out of prison into the clear sane lazy atmosphere of the camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to tell me that there is any one chump enough to do that for a dollar a hide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well the fool killer is certainly behind on his dates you conclude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about a week later one of your companions drags out of the alforja something crumpled that resembles in general appearance and texture a rusted fivegallon coaloil can that has been in a wreck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is only imperceptibly less stiff and angular and castiron than rawhide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then quietly you go out and sit on a high place before recognition brings inevitableand sickening chaff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for you know it at a glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along about the middle of that century an old prospector with four burros descended the basin trail and went into camp just below us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sincerely wish i could sketch this man for you just as he came down through the firelit trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was about six feet tall very leanly built with a weatherbeaten face of mahogany on which was superimposed a sweeping mustache and beetling eye brows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these had originally been brown but the sun had bleached them almost white in remarkable contrast to his complexion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eyes keen as sunlight twinkled far down beneath the shadows of the brows and a floppy old sombrero hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the usual flannel shirt waistcoat mountainboots and sixshooter completed the outfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might have been forty but was probably nearer sixty years of age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howdy boys said he and dropped to the fireside where he promptly annexed a coal for his pipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all greeted him but gradually the talk fell to him and wes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was commonplace talk enough from one point of view taken in essence it was merely like the inquiry and answer of the civilized man as to anothers itinerarydid you visit florence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont mean that father is dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked a look of terror coming to her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has been taken prisoner by these halfbreed devils on the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i doubt if they have killed himwe were going to his rescue when we ourselves were captured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mallory were taken three days ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shouted billy byrne who had entirely recovered from the blow that had merely served to stun him for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was yesterday replied norris these fellows from whom you so bravely rescued us told us that much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what made you think he was dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inquired the officer looking closely at byrne as though trying to place him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another man might have attempted to evade the question but the new billy byrne was no coward in any department of his moral or physical structure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i thought that i had killed him he replied the day that we took the lotus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain norris looked at the speaker in undisguised horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were one of those damned cutthroats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you the man that nearly killed poor mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss harding has he offered you any indignities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont judge him rashly captain norris said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for him i should have been dead and worse than dead long since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some day i will tell you of his heroism and his chivalry and dont forget captain that he has just saved you and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> foster from captivity and probable death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats right exclaimed the officer and i want to thank him but i dont understand about mallory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never mind about him now said billy byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if hes alive thats all that countsi havent got his blood on my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well after that gang of pirates left us continued the captain we rigged an extra wireless that they didnt know we had and it wasnt long before we raised the warship alaska <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her commander put a crew on board the lotus with machinists and everything necessary to patch her upcoaled and provisioned her and then lay by while we got her in running order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it didnt take near as long as you would have imagined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we set out in company with the warship to search for the clarinda as your captain simms called her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got on her track through a pirate junk just north of luzonhe said hed heard from the natives of a little outoftheway island near formosa that a brigantine had been wrecked there in the recent typhoon and his description of the vessel led us to believe that it might be the clarinda or halfmoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we made the island and after considerable search found the survivors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each of em tried to lay the blame on the others but finally they all agreed that a man by the name of theriere with a seaman called byrne had taken you into the interior and that they had believed you dead until a few days since they had captured one of the natives and learned that you had all escaped and were wandering in some part of the island unknown to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we set out with a company of marines to find you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father impatient of the seeming slowness of the officer in command pushed ahead with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poster and myself and two of the men of the lotus whom he had brought along with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three days ago we were attacked and your father and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of us escaped and endeavored to make our way back to the marines but we became confused and have been wandering aimlessly about the island ever since until we were surprised by these natives a few moments ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both the seamen were killed in this last fight and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> foster and myself taken prisonersthe rest you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne was on his feet now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found his sword and revolver and replaced them in his belt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you men stay here on the island and take care of miss harding he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i dont come back the marines will find you sooner or later or you can make your way to the coast and work around toward the cove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the balance of the day and all during the long night billy byrne swung along his lonely way retracing the familiar steps of the journey that had brought barbara harding and himself to the little island in the turbulent river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just before dawn he came to the edge of the clearing behind the dwelling of the late oda yorimoto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somewhere within the silent village he was sure that the two prisoners lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the long march he had thrashed over again and again all that the success of his rash venture would mean to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all those who might conceivably stand between him and the woman he lovedthe woman who had just acknowledged that she loved himthese two men were the most to be feared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne did not for a moment believe that anthony harding would look with favor upon the grand avenue mucker as a prospective soninlaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sure that barbara had loved this man and now should he be restored to her as from the grave there seemed little doubt but that the old love would be aroused in the girls breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth of the matter was that billy byrne could not conceive the truth of the testimony of his own earseven now he scarce dared believe that the wonderful miss harding loved himhim the despised mucker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the depth of the mans love for the girl and the genuineness of his newfound character were proven beyond question by the relentless severity with which he put away every thought of himself and the consequences to him in the matter he had undertaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what though the results sent him to a savage death or to a life of lonely misery or to the arms of his beloved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the face of duty the result was all the same to billy byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he stood looking at the moonbathed village listening for any sign of wakefulness or life then with all the stealth of an indian and with the trained wariness of the thief that he had been the mucker slunk noiselessly across the clearing to the shadows of the nearest hut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened beneath the window through which he and barbara and theriere had made their escape a few weeks before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no sound from within <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cautiously he raised himself to the sill and a moment later dropped into the inky darkness of the interior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with groping hands he felt about the roomit was unoccupied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he passed to the door at the far end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cautiously he opened it until a narrow crack gave him a view of the dimly lighted chamber beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mucker pushed the door still further open and stepped withinso must he search every hut within the village until he had found those he sought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not there and on silent feet that disturbed not even the lightly slumbering curs the man passed out by the front entrance into the street beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through a second and third hut he made his precarious way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the fourth a man stirred as byrne stood upon the opposite side of the room from the doorwith a catlike bound the mucker was beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the samurai turned restlessly and then with a start sat up with wideopen eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same instant iron fingers closed upon his throat and the long sword of his dead daimio passed through his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne held the corpse until he was positive that life was extinct then he dropped it quietly back upon its pallet and departed to search the adjoining dwelling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he found a large front room and a smaller chamber in the rearan arrangement similar to that in the daimios house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the front room revealed no clue to the missing men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within the smaller rear room byrne heard the subdued hum of whispered conversation just as he was about to open the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a graven image he stood in silence his ear glued to the frail door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he listened thus and then his heart gave a throb of exultation and he could have shouted aloud in thanksgivingthe men were conversing in english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quietly byrne pushed open the door far enough to admit his body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne closed the door behind him advancing until he felt one of the occupants of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man shrank from his touch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess were done for mallory said the man in a low tone theyve come for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yesfor gods sake who are you and where did you come from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be still admonished byrne feeling for the cords that he knew must bind the captive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he found them presently and with his jackknife cut them asunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> follow me he said but go quietly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take off your shoes if you have em on and hang em around your necktie the ends of the laces together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men did as he bid and a moment later he was leading them across the room filled with sleeping men women children and domestic animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the far side stood a rack filled with long swords <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne removed two without the faintest suspicion of a noise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he handed one to each of his companions cautioning them to silence with a gesture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but neither anthony harding nor billy mallory had had secondstory experience and the former struck his weapon accidentally against the door frame with a resounding clatter that brought half the inmates of the room wideeyed to sitting postures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight that met the natives eyes had them on their feet yelling like madmen and dashing toward their escaping prisoners in an instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down the village street the three men ran but the shouts of the natives had brought armed samurai to every door with a celerity that was uncanny and in another moment the fugitives found themselves surrounded by a pack of howling warriors who cut at them with long swords from every side blocking their retreat and hemming them in in every direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne called to his companions to close in back to back and thus the gangster in advance the three slowly fought their way toward the end of the narrow street and the jungle beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mucker fought with his long sword in one hand and therieres revolver in the otherhewing a way toward freedom for the two men whom he knew would take his love from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath the brilliant tropic moon that lighted the scene almost as brilliantly as might the sun himself the battle waged and though the odds were painfully uneven the white men moved steadily though slowly toward the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was evident that the natives feared the giant white who led the three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthony harding familiar with japanese could translate sufficient of their jargon to be sure of that had not the respectful distance most of them kept from byrne been ample proof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of the village street they came at last into the clearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the warriors danced about them yelling threats and taunts the while they made occasional dashes to close quarters that they might deliver a swift sword cut and retreat again before the great white devil could get them with the sword that had been oda yorimotos or the strange fire stick that spoke in such a terrifying voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fifty feet from the jungle mallory went down with a spear through the calf of his leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne saw him fall and dropping back lifted the man to his feet supporting him with one arm as the two backed slowly in front of the onpressing natives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spears were flying thick and fast now for the samurai all were upon the same side of the enemy and there was no danger of injuring one of their own number with their flying weapons as there had been when the host entirely surrounded the three men and when the whites at last entered the tall grasses of the jungle a perfect shower of spears followed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the volley byrne went downhe had been the principal target for the samurai and three of the heavy shafts had pierced his body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two were buried in his chest and one in his abdomen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both his companions were down and the savages were pressing closely on toward their hiding place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mallory sat upon the ground trying to tear the spear from his leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne still conscious called to harding to pull the three shafts from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will get us again as sure as fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they havent got us yet said billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill see he said and then yes i can make it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost due north across this range of hills behind us is a valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the center of the valley is a river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a good fifteenhour march for a well manit will take mallory and you longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> follow down the river till you come to a little islandit should be the first one from where you strike the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on that island you will find miss harding norris and foster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have to though replied billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wont work any other way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raised his revolver and fired a single shot in the direction of the howling savages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats to let em know were still here he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill keep that up off and on as long as i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll fool em into thinking that were all here and cover your escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont do it said mallory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes you will replied the mucker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not any of us that countsits miss harding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as many as can have got to get back to her just as quick as the lordll let us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant so you twoll have to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im done fora blind man could see that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wouldnt do a bit of good for you two to hang around here and get killed waitin for me to die but it would do a lot of harm for it might mean that miss harding would be lost too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you say my daughter is on this island you speak of with norris and fosteris she quite safe and well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perfectly said byrne and now beat ityoure wasting a lot of precious time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for barbaras sake it looks like the only way said anthony harding but it seems wicked and cowardly to desert a noble fellow like you sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is wicked said billy mallory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there must be some other way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the way old man who are you anyhow and how did you happen to be here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne turned his face upward so that the full moon lighted his features clearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no other way mallory he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now take a good look at medont you recognize me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mallory gazed intently at the strong face looking into his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is something familiar about your face he said but i cannot place you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor does it make any difference who you areyou have risked your life to save ours and i shall not leave you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harding goit is not necessary for both to stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will both go insisted byrne and you will find that it does make a big difference who i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hadnt intended telling you but i see there is no other way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im the mucker that nearly killed you on board the lotus mallory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im the fellow that manhandled miss harding until even that beast of a simms made me quit and miss harding has been alone with me on this island for weeksnow go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned away so that they could no longer see his face with the mental anguish that he knew must be writ large upon it and commenced firing toward the natives once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthony harding stood with white face and clinched hands during byrnes recital of his identity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at its close he took a threatening step toward the prostrate man raising his long sword with a muffled oath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy mallory sprang before him catching his upraised arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> think what we owe him now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the two men turned north into the jungle while billy byrne lay upon his belly in the tall grass firing from time to time into the direction from which came an occasional spear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthony harding and billy mallory kept on in silence along their dismal way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crack of the muckers revolver growing fainter and fainter as they drew away from the scene of conflict apprised the men that their rescuer still lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a time the distant reports ceased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two walked on in silence for a few minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did not hear any further firing behind them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> day rolled slowly on into night once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and still they staggered on footsore and weary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mallory suffered excruciating agony from his wound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were times when it seemed that it would be impossible for him to continue another yard but then the thought that barbara harding was somewhere ahead of them and that in a short time now they must be with her once more kept him doggedly at his painful task <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had reached the river and were following slowly down its bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon full and gorgeous flooded the landscape with silvery light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the bank opposite they stopped and hallooed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost instantly three figures rushed from the interior of the island to the shore before themtwo men and a woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norris and foster hastened through the river and brought the two men to the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barbara harding threw herself into her fathers arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later she had grasped mallorys outstretched hands and then she looked beyond them for another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is dead said anthony harding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl looked wideeyed and uncomprehending at her father for a full minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she moaned and fell unconscious at his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne continued to fire intermittently for half an hour after the two men had left him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he fired several shots in quick succession and dragging himself to his hands and knees crawled laboriously and painfully back into the jungle in search of a hiding place where he might die in peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had progressed some hundred yards when he felt the earth give way beneath him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clutched frantically about for support but there was none and with a sickening lunge he plunged downward into stygian darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his fall was a short one and he brought up with a painful thud at the bottom of a deer pita covered trap which the natives dig to catch their fleetfooted prey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pain of his wounds after the fall was excruciating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that he was dying and then all went black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when consciousness returned to the mucker it was daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sky above shone through the ragged hole that his falling body had broken in the pits covering the night before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> muttered the mucker and i thought that i was dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wounds had ceased to bleed but he was very weak and stiff and sore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess im too tough to croak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered if the two men would reach barbara in safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mallory loved her and he was sure that barbara had loved mallory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted her to be happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no thought of jealousy entered his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how would he have looked training with her bunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would have been ashamed of him and he couldnt have stood that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no it was better as it had turned out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hed squared himself for the beast hed been to her and hed squared himself with mallory too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least theyd have only decent thoughts of him dead but alive that would be an entirely different thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would be in the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would be a constant embarrassment to them all for they would feel that theyd have to be nice to him in return for what he had done for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought made the mucker sick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he didnt croakinstead he waxed stronger and toward evening the pangs of hunger and thirst drove him to consider means for escaping from his hiding place and searching for food and water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waited until after dark and then he crawled with utmost difficulty from the deep pit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had heard nothing of the natives since the night before and now in the open there came to him but the faint sounds of the village life across the clearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne dragged himself toward the trail that led to the spring where poor theriere had died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took him a long time to reach it but at last he was successful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clear cold water helped to revive and strengthen him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some wild fruit partially satisfied him for the moment and he commenced the laborious task of retracing his steps toward manhattan island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trail that he had passed over in fifteen hours as he had hastened to the rescue of anthony harding and billy mallory required the better part of three days now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> occasionally he wondered why in the world he was traversing it anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hadnt he wanted to die and leave barbara free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but life is sweet and the red blood still flowed strong in the veins of the mucker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can go my own way he thought and not bother her but ill be dinged if i want to croak in this godforsaken holegrand avenue for mine when it comes to passing in my checks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but id like to hear the rattle of the lake street l and see the dolls coming down the station steps by skidmores when the crowd comes home from the loop at night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then too his heart was very heavy and sad because of the great love he had found a love which he realized was as hopeless as it was great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had the memory though of the girls arms about his neck and her dear lips crushed to his for a brief instant and her wordsah those words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would ring in billys head forever i love you billy for what you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a sudden resolve came into the muckers mind as he whispered those words over and over again to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant have her he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she isnt for the likes of me but if i cant live with her i can live for heras shed want me to live and shelp me those wordsll keep me straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she ever hears of billy byrne again it wont be anything to make her ashamed that she had her arms around him kissing him and telling him that she loved him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the rivers edge across from the little island billy came to a halt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had reached the point near midnight and hesitated to cross over and disturb the party at that hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last however he decided to cross quietly and lie down near her hut until morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crossing was most difficult for he was very weak but at last he came to the opposite bank and drew himself up to lie panting for a few minutes on the sloping bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he crawled on again up to the top and staggering to his feet made his way cautiously toward the two huts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he assumed that the party was asleep and so he lay down near the rude shelter he had constructed for barbara harding and fell asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was broad daylight when he awokethe sun was fully three hours high and yet no one was stirring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time misgivings commenced to assail billys mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he crossed over to his own hut and enteredit was deserted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he ran to barbarasit too was unoccupied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all during the painful trip from the village to the island billy had momentarily expected to meet a party of rescuers coming back for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not been exactly disappointed but a queer little lump had risen to his throat as the days passed and no help had come and now this was the final blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> left him wounded and dying on this savage island without taking the trouble to assure themselves that he really was dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt i tell them that i was dying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought so myself and there is no reason why they shouldnt have thought so too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i shouldnt blame them and i dont but i wouldnt have left them that way and not come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had a warship full of blue jackets and marinesthere wouldnt have been much danger to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently it occurred to him that the party may have returned to the coast to get the marines and that even now they were searching for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hastened to return to the mainland and once more he took up his wearisome journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night he reached the coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early the next morning he commenced his search for the manofwar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by walking entirely around the island he should find her he felt sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shortly after noon he scaled a high promontory which jutted out into the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from its summit he had an unobstructed view of the broad pacific <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his heart leaped to his throat for there but a short distance out were a great battleship and a trim white yachtthe alaska and the lotus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were steaming slowly out to sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> filled with happiness the mucker ran to the point of the promontory and stripping off his shirt waved it high above his head the while he shouted at the top of his lungs but the vessels kept on their course giving no answering signal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for half an hour the man continued his futile efforts to attract the attention of someone on board either craft but to his dismay he saw them grow smaller and smaller until in a few hours they passed over the rim of the world disappearing from his view forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weak wounded and despairing billy sank to the ground burying his face in his arms and there the moon found him when she rose and he was still there when she passed from the western sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for three months billy byrne lived his lonely life upon the wild island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trapping and fishing were good and there was a plentiful supply of good water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he regained his lost strength recovering entirely from his wounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the natives did not molest him for he had stumbled upon a section of the shore which they considered bewitched and to which none of them would come under any circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one morning at the beginning of his fourth month of solitude the mucker saw a smudge of smoke upon the horizon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly it increased in volume and the speck beneath it resolved itself into the hull of a steamer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> closer and closer to the island it came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy gathered together a quantity of dry brush and lighted a signal fire on the lofty point from which he had seen the alaska and the lotus disappear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it commenced to blaze freely he threw fresh green boughs upon it until a vertical column of smoke arose high above the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in breathless suspense billy watched the movements of the steamer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first it seemed that she would pass without taking notice of his signal but at last he saw that she was changing her course and moving directly toward the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> close in she came for the sea was calm and the water deep and when billy was sure that those on board saw him and his frantic waving he hurried stumbling and falling down the steep face of the cliff to the tiny beach at its foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already a boat had been lowered and was putting in for land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy waded out to the end of the short shelving beach and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight that met the eyes of the rescuers was one that filled them with awe for they saw before them a huge giant of a white man halfnaked except for a few tattered rags who wore the long sword of an ancient samurai at his side a modern revolver at his hip and bore in his brawny hand the heavy war spear of a headhunter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long black hair and a huge beard covered the mans head and face but clean gray eyes shone from out of the tangle and a broad grin welcomed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you certainly do look good to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six months later a big smoothfaced giant in illfitting sea togs strolled up sixth avenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was billy byrnebroke but happy grand avenue was less than a thousand miles away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he murmured but its good to be home again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were places in new york where billy would find acquaintances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one in particular he recalleda little thirdfloor gymnasium not far distant from the battery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thither he turned his steps now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he entered the stuffy room in which two big fellows stripped to the waist were sparring a stout lowbrowed man sitting in a backtilted chair against one wall looked up inquiringly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy crossed over to him with outstretched hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yeh got me kid replied professor cassidy taking the proffered hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was up here with larry hilmore and the goose island kid a year or so agomy names byrne exclaimed billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure said the professor i gotcha now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre de guy at larry was a tellin me about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said youd be a great heavy if youd leave de booze alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont look much like a booze fighter now remarked cassidy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i aint said the mucker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been on the wagon for most a year and im never comin down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats right kid said the professor but wots the good word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wot you doin in little ol noo york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lookin for a job said billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im lookin for sparrin partners for a gink dats goin to clean up de big smokeif hell ever come back an scrap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre on said billy commencing to divest himself of his outer clothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stripped to the waist he displayed as wondrous a set of muscles as even professor cassidy had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man waxed enthusiastic over them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you sure ought to have some wallop up your sleeve he said admiringly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then introduced billy to the harlem hurricane and battling dago pete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petes de guy i was tellin you about explained professor cassidy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got such a wallop dat i cant keep no sparrin partners for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hurricane heres de only bloke wit de guts to stay wit him hes a fiend for punishment hurricane is he jest natchrly eats it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youre broke ill give you your keep as long as you stay wit pete an dont get cold feet an ill fix up a mill for you now an then sos you kin pull down a little coin fer yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all to the good then said the professor gaily now you put on the mitts an spell hurricane for a couple o rounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy slipped his huge hands into the tightfitting gloves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its been moren a year since i had these on he said an i may be a little slow an stale at first but after i get warmed up ill do better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cassidy grinned and winked at hurricane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wont never get warmed up hurricane confided petell knock his block off in about two minutes and the men settled back to watch the fun with illconcealed amusement written upon their faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what happened within the next few minutes in the stuffy little room of professor cassidys thirdfloor gymnasium marks an epoch in the professors lifehe still talks of it and doubtless shall until the great referee counts him out in the last round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two men sparred for a moment gaging one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then battling dago pete swung a vicious left that landed square on billys face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a blow that might have felled an ox but billy only shook his headit scarce seemed to jar him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pete had half lowered his hands as he recovered from the blow so sure he was that it would finish his new sparring partner and now before he could regain his guard the mucker tore into him like a whirlwind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that single blow to the face seemed to have brought back to billy byrne all that he ever had known of the manly art of selfdefense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> battling dago pete landed a few more before the fight was over but as any old fighter will tell you there is nothing more discouraging than to discover that your most effective blows do not feeze your opponent and only the knowledge of what a defeat at the hands of a new sparring partner would mean to his future kept him plugging away at the hopeless task of attempting to knock out this mountain of bone and muscle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a few minutes billy byrne played with his man hitting him when and where he would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fought crouching much as jeffries used to fight and in his size and strength was much that reminded cassidy of the fallen idol that in his heart of hearts he still worshiped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then like a panther the mucker sprang in with a vicious left hook to the jaw followed with lightning rapidity by a right upper cut to the chin that lifted battling dago pete a foot from the floor to drop him unconscious against the foot of the further wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a clean knockout and when cassidy and hurricane got through ministering to the fallen man and indications of returning consciousness were apparent the professor turned to billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got any more hopes lyin around loose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the mucker with a grin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess the big dinges safe for a while yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not if youll keep on stayin away from the booze kid said professor cassidy an let me handle you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gotcha steve said billy go to it but first stake me to a feed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the front side of my stomachs wrapped around my back bone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for three months billy met hasbeens and third and fourthrate fighters from new york and its environs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thrashed them allusually by the knockout route and finally local sports commenced talking about him a bit and he was matched up with secondraters from other cities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these men he cleaned up as handily as he had the others so that it was apparent to fight fandom that the big quiet unknown was a comer and pretty soon professor cassidy received an offer from another trainermanager to match billy against a real hope who stood in the forefront of hopedom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this other manager stated that he thought the mill would prove excellent practice for his man who was having difficulty in finding opponents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor cassidy thought so too and grinned for two hours straight after reading the challenge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the details of the fight were quickly arranged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in accordance with the state regulations it was to be a ten round no decision boutthe weight of the gloves was prescribed by law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the name of the white hope against whom billy was to go was sufficient to draw a fair house and there were some there who had seen billy in other fights and looked for a good mill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the coming champion as billys opponent was introduced stepped into the ring he received a hearty round of applause whereas there was but a scattered ripple of handclapping to greet the mucker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time he ever had stepped into a ring with a firstrate fighter and as he saw the huge muscles of his antagonist and recalled the stories he had heard of his prowess and science billy for the first time in his life felt a tremor of nervousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes wandered across the ropes to the sea of faces turned up toward him and all of a sudden billy byrne went into a blue funk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor cassidy shrewd and experienced saw it even as soon as billy realized ithe saw the fading of his high hopeshe saw his castles in spain tumbling in ruins about his earshe saw his huge giant lying prone within that squared circle as the hand of the referee rose and fell in cadence to the ticking of seconds that would count his man out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he whispered take a swig o this and he pressed a bottle toward billys lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stuff had kept him down all his lifehe had sworn never to touch another drop of it and he never would whether he lost this and every other fight he ever fought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had sworn to leave it alone for her sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the gong called him to the center of the ring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy knew that he was afraidhe thought that he was afraid of the big trained fighter who faced him but cassidy knew that it was a plain case of stage fright that had gripped his man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew too that it would be enough to defeat billys every chance for victory and after the big white hope had felled billy twice in the first minute of the first round cassidy knew that it was all over but the shouting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fans many of them were laughing and yelling derogatory remarks at billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stan up an fight yeh big stiff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and back to de farm fer youse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then high above the others a shrill voice cried coward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the word penetrated billys hopeless muddled brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had called him that once and then she had changed her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theriere had thought him a coward yet as he died he had said that he was the bravest man he ever had known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy recalled the yelling samurai with their keen swords and terrible spears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw the little room in the palace of oda yorimoto and again he faced the brown devils who had hacked and hewed and stabbed at him that day as he fought to save the woman he loved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was there in this padded ring for a man to fear who had faced death as billy had faced it and without an instants consciousness of the meaning of the word fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was wrong with him and then the shouts and curses and taunts of the crowd smote upon his ears and he knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again the heavy fist of the coming champion brought billy to the mat and then before further damage could be done him the gong saved him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a surprised and chastened mucker that walked with bent head to his corner after the first round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white hope was grinning and confident and so he returned to the center of the ring for the second round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the short interval billy had thrashed the whole thing out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowd had gotten on his nerves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was trying to fight the whole crowd instead of just one manhe would do better in this round but the first thing that happened after he faced his opponent sent the fans into delirious ecstasies of shouting and hooting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy swung his right for his foes jawa terrible blow that would have ended the fight had it landedbut the man sidestepped it and billys momentum carried him sprawling upon his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he regained his feet the white hope was waiting for him and billy went down again to lie there quite still while the hand of the referee marked the seconds one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the meaning of that monotonous count finally percolated to the muckers numbed perceptive faculties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a flash he was on his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ragecool calculating rage possessed himnot the feverish hysterical variety that takes its victims brains away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had been counting out the man whom barbara harding had once loved!the man she had thought the bravest in the world!they were making a monkey and a coward of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white hope was waiting for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy was scarce off his knees before the man rushed at him wickedly a smile playing about his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was to be the last of that smile however <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy met the rush with his old familiar crouch and stopped his man with a straight to the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cassidy saw it and almost smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he didnt think that billy could come backbut at least he was fighting for a minute in his old form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surprised hope rushed in to punish his presuming foe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy ducked beneath a vicious left swing and put a right to the side of the hopes head that sent the man to his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the third round billy fought carefully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had made up his mind that he would show this bunch of pikers that he knew how to box so that none might say that he had won with a lucky punch for billy intended to win <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the round was one which might fill with delight the soul of the fan who knows the finer points of the game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when it was over while little damage had been done on either side it left no shadow of a doubt in the minds of those who knew that the unknown fighter was the more skilful boxer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course there was no question in the minds of the majority of the spectators as to who would win the fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stranger had merely shown one of those sudden and ephemeral bursts of form that occasionally are witnessed in every branch of sport but he couldnt last against such a man as the white hope!they looked for a knockout any minute now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor did they look in vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy was quite satisfied with the work he had done in the preceding round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he would show them another style of fighting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the tap of the gong he rushed his opponent about the ring at will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hit him when and where he pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man was absolutely helpless before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with left and right hooks billy rocked the coming champions head from side to side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he landed upon the swelling optics of his victim as he listed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thrice he rushed him to the ropes and once the man fell through them into the laps of the hooting spectatorsonly now they were not hooting billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until the gong billy played with his man as a cat might play with a mouse yet not once had he landed a knockout blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried professor cassidy as billy returned to his corner after the round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had im goin manwhy in the world didnt yeh finish him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt want to said billy not in that round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im reserving the finish for the fifth round and if you want to win some money you can take the hunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might make more by laying that id make him take the count in the first minute of the roundyou can place a hundred of mine on that if you will please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cassidy took the hunch and a moment later as the two men faced each other he regretted his act for to his surprise the white hope came up for the fifth round smiling and confident once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> someones been handin him an earful grumbled cassidy an it might be all he needed to take im through the first minute of the round and maybe the whole roundive seen that did lots o times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the two men met the white hope was the aggressor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rushed in to close quarters aiming a stinging blow at billys face and then to cassidys chagrin and the crowds wonder the mucker lowered his guard and took the wallop full on the jaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blow seemed never to jar him the least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hope swung again and there stood billy byrne like a huge bronze statue taking blow after blow that would have put an ordinary man down for the count <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fans saw and appreciated the spectacular bravado of the act and they went wild <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cheer on cheer rose hoarse and deafening to the rafters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white hope lost his selfcontrol and what little remained of his short temper and deliberately struck billy a foul blow but before the referee could interfere the mucker swung another just such blow as he had missed and fallen with in the second round but this time he did not misshis mighty fist caught the coming champion on the point of the chin lifted him off his feet and landed him halfway through the ropes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he lay while the referee tolled off the count of ten and as the official took billys hand in his and raised it aloft in signal that he had won the fight the fickle crowd cheered and screamed in a delirium of joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cassidy crawled through the ropes and threw his arms around billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew youse could do it kid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre as good as made now an youre de next champ or i never seen one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following morning the sporting sheets hailed sailor byrne as the greatest white hope of them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flashlights of him filled a quarter of a page <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interviews with the man he had defeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interviews with everybody and all were agreed that he was the most likely heavy since jeffries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> corbett admitted that while in his prime he could doubtless have bested the new wonder he would have found him a tough customer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everyone said that byrnes future was assured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not a man in sight who could touch him and none who had seen him fight the night before but would have staked his last dollar on him in a mill with the black champion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cassidy wired a challenge to the negros manager and received an answer that was most favorable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the terms were as usual rather onesided but cassidy accepted them and it seemed before noon that a fight was assured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy was more nearly happy again than he had been since the day he had renounced barbara harding to the man he thought she loved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he read and reread the accounts in the papers and then searching for more references to himself off the sporting page he ran upon the very name that had been constantly in his thoughts for all these monthsharding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> persistent rumor has it that the engagement of the beautiful miss harding to wm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss harding could not be seen at her fathers home up to a late hour last night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mallory refused to discuss the matter but would not deny the rumor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was more but that was all that billy byrne read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the paper dropped from his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> battles and championships faded from his thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat with his eyes bent upon the floor and his mind was thousands of miles away across the broad pacific upon a little island in the midst of a turbulent stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and far uptown another sat with the same paper in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barbara harding was glancing through the sporting sheet in search of the scores of yesterdays womans golf tournament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as she searched her eyes suddenly became riveted upon the picture of a giant man and she forgot about tournaments and low scores <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hastily she searched the heads and text until she came upon the namesailor byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greedily she read and reread all that had been written about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she barbara harding scion of an aristocratic houseultrasociety girl read and reread the accounts of a brutal prize fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a half hour later a messenger boy found sailor byrne the center of an admiring throng in professor cassidys thirdfloor gymnasium <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with worshiping eyes taking in his new hero from head to foot the youth handed byrne a note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood staring at the heavy weight until he had perused it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no answer kid replied byrne that i cant take myself and he tossed a dollar to the worshiping boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an hour later billy byrne was ascending the broad white steps that led to the entrance of anthony hardings new york house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the servant who answered his ring eyed him suspiciously for billy byrne still dressed like a teamster on holiday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the servant left him standing in the hallway and started to ascend the great staircase but halfway up he met miss harding coming down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne and then seeing that the fellow had not seated her visitor she added he is a very dear friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> smith faded quickly from the scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the girl rushing toward him with outstretched hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o billy we thought you were dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long have you been here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why havent you been to see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great mad hope had been surging through his being since he had read of the broken engagement and received the girls note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now in her eyes in her whole attitude he could read as unmistakably as though her lips had formed the words that he had not hoped in vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but some strange influence had seemed suddenly to come to work upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even in the brief moment of his entrance into the magnificence of anthony hardings home he had felt a strange little stricture of the throata choking halfsuffocating sensation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the attitude of the servant the splendor of the furnishings the stateliness of the great hall and the apartments opening upon itall had whispered to him that he did not belong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now barbara clothed in some wondrous foreign creation belied by her very appearance the expression that suffused her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no billy byrne the mucker did not belong there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor ever could he belong more than barbara ever could have belonged on grand avenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and billy byrne knew it now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bottom seemed suddenly to have dropped out of his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bravely he had battled to forget this wonderful creature or rather his hopeless love for herher he could never forget <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the note from her and the sight of her had but served to rekindle the old fire within his breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his own life or happiness did not count <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seen the lovelight in her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thanked god that he had realized what it all would have meant before he let her see that he had seen it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been back several months he said presently in answer to her question but i got sense enough to stay where i belong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wouldnt i look great comin up here buttin in wit youse bunch of highlifes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy slapped his thigh resoundingly and laughed in stentorian tones that caused the eyebrows of the sensitive smith on the floor above to elevate in shocked horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt break away from me work could i to chase a bunch of skirts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barbara felt a qualm of keen disappointment that billy bad fallen again into the old dialect that she had all but eradicated during those days upon distant manhattan island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wouldnt o come up atal he went on if i hadnt o read in de poiper how youse an mallory had busted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tought id breeze in an see wot de trouble was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes had been averted mostly as he talked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he swung suddenly upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes on de square aint he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not quite sure whether to feel offended or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the memory of billys antecedents came to his rescue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course he didnt know that it was such terribly bad form to broach such a subject to her she thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then continued the mucker wots up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youse loved him or youse wouldnt have got engaged to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the statement was almost an interrogation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see billy she started i have always known mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mallory and always thought that i loved him untiluntil there was no answering light in billys eyesno encouragement for the words that were on her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she went on presently we became engaged after we reached new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all thought you dead she concluded simply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think as much of him now as you did when you promised to marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked ignoring her reference to himself and all that it implied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is at the bottom of this row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had fallen back into the decent pronunciation that barbara had taught him but neither noticed the change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he had forgotten that he was playing a part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt rid myself of the feeling that they had murdered you by leaving you back there alone and wounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to think coward every time i saw mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt marry him feeling that way toward him and billy i really never loved him asas again she stumbled but the mucker made no attempt to grasp the opportunity opened before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead he crossed the library to the telephone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> running through the book he came presently upon the number he sought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later he had his connection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de guy dat cracked your puss fer youse on de lotus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say im up here at barbaras <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wants youse to beat it up heres swift as youse kin beat it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried attempting to seize the telephone from billys grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned his huge frame between her and the instrument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he turned back toward the angry girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once youse was strong on de sob stuff wit me tellin me how noble i was an all de different tings youse would do fer me to repay all i done fer youse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what can i do for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youse kin do dis fer me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when mallory gits here youse kin tell him dat de engagement is all on againsee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the wide eyes of the girl billy read a deeper hurt than he had dreamed of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had thought that it would not be difficult for her to turn back from the vulgar mucker to the polished gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he saw that she was suffering and guessed that it was because he had tried to crush her love by brute force he could carry the game no further <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o barbara he cried cant you see that mallory is your kindthat he is a fit mate for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have learned since i came into this house a few minutes ago the unbridgeable chasm that stretches between billy byrne the mucker and such as you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once i aspired but now i know just as you must have always known that a single lifetime is far too short for a man to cover the distance from grand avenue to riverside drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to be happy barbara just as i intend to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> back there in chicago there are plenty of girls on grand avenue as straight and clean and fine as they make em on riverside drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> girls of my own kind they are and im going back there to find the one that god intended for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve taught me what a good girl can do toward making a man of a beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve taught me pride and selfrespect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve taught me so much that id rather that id died back there beneath the spears of oda isekas warriors than live here beneath the sneers and contempt of servants and the pity and condescension of your friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to be happy barbara and so i want you to promise me that youll marry billy mallory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there isnt any man on earth quite good enough for you but mallory comes nearer to it than anyone i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive heard em talking about him around town since i came backand there isnt a rotten story chalked up against him nowhere and thats a lot more than you can say for ninetynine of a hundred new yorkers that are talked about at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mallorys a man toothe kind that every woman ought to have only they aint enough of em to go round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you remember how he stood up there on the deck of the lotus and fought fair against my dirty tricks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a man and a gentleman barbarathe sort you can be proud of and thats the sort you got to have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he fought against those fellows of yoka in the street of oda isekas village like a man should fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there aint any yellow in him barbara and he didnt leave me until there seemed no other way even in the face of the things i told them to make them go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont harbor that against himi only wonder that he didnt croak me your dad wanted to and mallory wouldnt let him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they never told me that said barbara <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he is now said billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> smithll let me out the servants door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guess thatll make him feel better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll do as i ask barbara <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had paused at the door turning toward her as he asked the final question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes were dim with unshed tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne swam before them in a hazy mist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll do as i ask barbara <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he repeated but this time it was a command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as mallory entered the room barbara heard the door of the servants entrance slam behind billy byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne squared his broad shoulders and filled his deep lungs with the familiar medium which is known as air in chicago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was standing upon the platform of a new york central train that was pulling into the la salle street station and though the young man was far from happy something in the nature of content pervaded his being for he was coming home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after something more than a year of world wandering and strange adventure billy byrne was coming back to the great west side and grand avenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there is not much upon either side or down the center of long and tortuous grand avenue to arouse enthusiasm nor was billy particularly enthusiastic about that more or less squalid thoroughfare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing that exalted billy was the idea that he was coming back to show them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had left under a cloud and with a reputation for genuine toughness and rowdyism that has seen few parallels even in the ungentle district of his birth and upbringing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was as far removed from billys sphere as the stars themselves but billy had loved her and learned from her and in trying to become more as he knew the men of her class were he had sloughed off much of the uncouthness that had always been a part of him and all of the rowdyism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne was no longer the mucker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had given her up because he imagined the gulf between grand avenue and riverside drive to be unbridgeable but he still clung to the ideals she had awakened in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still sought to be all that she might wish him to be even though he realized that he never should see her again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grand avenue would be the easiest place to forget his sorrowher he could never forget <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then his newly awakened pride urged him back to the haunts of his former life that he might as he would put it himself show them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted the gang to see that he billy byrne wasnt afraid to be decent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted some of the neighbors to realize that he could work steadily and earn an honest living and he looked forward with delight to the pleasure and satisfaction of rubbing it in to some of the saloon keepers and bartenders who had helped keep him drunk some five days out of seven for billy didnt drink any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but most of all he wanted to vindicate himself in the eyes of the oncehated law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted to clear his record of the unjust charge of murder which had sent him scurrying out of chicago over a year before that night that patrolman stanley lasky of the lake street station had tipped him off that sheehan had implicated him in the murder of old man schneider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now billy byrne had not killed schneider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been nowhere near the old fellows saloon at the time of the holdup but sheehan who had been arrested and charged with the crime was an old enemy of billys and sheehan had seen a chance to divert some of the suspicion from himself and square accounts with byrne at the same time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the new billy byrne was ready to accept at face value everything which seemed to belong in any way to the environment of that exalted realm where dwelt the girl he loved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> law order and justice appeared to billy in a new light since he had rubbed elbows with the cultured and refined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he no longer distrusted or feared them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would give him what he soughta square deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed odd to billy that he should be seeking anything from the law or its minions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for years he had waged a perpetual battle with both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now he was coming back voluntarily to give himself up with every conviction that he should be exonerated quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy knowing his own innocence realizing his own integrity assumed that others must immediately appreciate both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first thought billy ill go take a look at little old grand ave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trial may take a long time an if it does i want to see some of the old bunch first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so billy entered an l coach and leaning on the sill of an open window watched grimy chicago rattle past until the guards granavenoo announced the end of his journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maggie shane was sitting on the upper step of the long flight of stairs which lean precariously against the scarred face of the frame residence upon the second floor front of which the lares and penates of the shane family are crowded into three illsmelling rooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was saturday and maggie was off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat there rather disconsolate for there was a dearth of beaux for maggie none having arisen to fill the aching void left by the sudden departure of coke sheehan since that worthy gentleman had sought a more salubrious climeto the consternation of both maggie shane and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maggie scowled down upon the frowsy street filled with frowsy women and frowsy children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she scowled upon the street cars rumbling by with their frowsy loads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> occasionally she varied the monotony by drawing out her chewing gum to wondrous lengths holding one end between a thumb and finger and the other between her teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently maggie spied a rather pleasing figure sauntering up the sidewalk upon her side of the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man was too far away for her to recognize his features but his size and bearing and general appearance appealed to the lonesome maggie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hoped it was someone she knew or with whom she might easily become acquainted for maggie was bored to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she patted the hair at the back of her head and righted the mop which hung over one eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she rearranged her skirts and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the man approached she saw that he was better looking than she had even dared to hope and that there was something extremely familiar about his appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not though until he was almost in front of the house that he looked up at the girl and she recognized him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then maggie shane gasped and clutched the handrail at her side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an instant later the man was past and continuing his way along the sidewalk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maggie shane glared after him for a minute then she ran quickly down the stairs and into a grocery store a few doors west where she asked if she might use the telephone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gimme west she demanded of the operator and a moment later is this lake street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes an never mind who i am but if youse guys want him hes walkin west on grand avenoo right now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i just this minute seen him near lincoln and she smashed the receiver back into its hook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne thought that he would look in on his mother not that he expected to be welcomed even though she might happen to be sober or not that he cared to see her but billys whole manner of thought had altered within the year and something now seemed to tell him that it was his duty to do the thing he contemplated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe he might even be of help to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when he reached the gloomy neighborhood in which his childhood had been spent it was to learn that his mother was dead and that another family occupied the tumbledown cottage that had been his home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if billy byrne felt any sorrow because of his mothers death he did not reveal it outwardly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he owed her nothing but for kicks and cuffs received and for the surroundings and influences that had started him upon a life of crime at an age when most boys are just entering grammar school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really the man was relieved that he had not had to see her and it was with a lighter step that he turned back to retrace his way along grand avenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one of the few he had met who recognized him had seemed particularly delighted at his return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole affair had been something of a disappointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore billy determined to go at once to the lake street station and learn the status of the schneider murder case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> possibly they had discovered the real murderer and if that was the case billy would be permitted to go his way but if not then he could give himself up and ask for a trial that he might be exonerated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he neared wood street two men who had been watching his approach stepped into the doorway of a saloon and as he passed they stepped out again behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one upon either side they seized him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come easy now byrne admonished one of the men an dont make no fuss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh said billy its you is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i was just goin over to the station to give myself up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well just save you the trouble said one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might lose your way if you tried to go alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy went along in silence the rest of the way to where the patrol waited at another corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw there was nothing to be gained by talking to these detectives but he found the lieutenant equally inclined to doubt his intentions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he too only laughed when billy assured him that he was on his way to the station at the very instant of arrest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the weeks dragged along and billy byrne found no friendly interest in himself or his desire to live on the square and no belief in his protestations that he had had naught to do with the killing of schneider he began to have his doubts as to the wisdom of his act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he also commenced to entertain some of his former opinions of the police and of the law of which they are supposed to be the guardians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cellmate told him that the papers had scored the department heavily for their failure to apprehend the murderer of the inoffensive old schneider and that public opinion had been so aroused that a general police shakeup had followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result was that the police were keen to fasten the guilt upon someonethey did not care whom so long as it was someone who was in their custody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may not o done it ventured the cellmate but theyll send you up for it if they cant hang you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre goin to try to get the death sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they haint got no love for you byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you caused em a lot o throuble in your day an they havent forgot it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id hate to be in your boots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where were his dreams of justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed to have faded back into the old distrust and hatred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook himself and conjured in his mind the vision of a beautiful girl who had believed in him and trusted him who had inculcated within him a love for all that was finest and best in true manhood for the very things that he had most hated all the years of his life before she had come into his existence to alter it and him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then billy would believe againbelieve that in the end justice would triumph and that it would all come out right just the way he had pictured it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the coming of the last day of the trial billy found it more and more difficult to adhere to his regard for law order and justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prosecution had shown conclusively that billy was a hard customer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the police had brought witnesses who did not hesitate to perjure themselves in their testimony testimony which it seemed to billy the densest of jurymen could plainly see had been framed up and learned by rote until it was letterperfect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these witnesses could recall with startling accuracy every detail that had occurred between seventeen minutes after eight and twentyone minutes past nine on the night of september over a year before but where they had been and what they had done ten minutes earlier or ten minutes later or where they were at nine oclock in the evening last friday they couldnt for the lives of them remember <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and billy was practically without witnesses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result was a foregone conclusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even billy had to admit it and when the prosecuting attorney demanded the death penalty the prisoner had an uncanny sensation as of the tightening of a hempen rope about his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he waited for the jury to return its verdict billy sat in his cell trying to read a newspaper which a kindly guard had given him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his eyes persisted in boring through the white paper and the black type to scenes that were not in any paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw a turbulent river tumbling through a savage world and in the swirl of the water lay a little island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he saw a man there upon the island and a girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl was teaching the man to speak the language of the cultured and to view life as people of refinement view it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she taught him what honor meant among her class and that it was better to lose any other possession rather than lose honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy realized that it had been these lessons that had spurred him on to the mad scheme that was to end now with the verdict of guiltyhe had wished to vindicate his honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hard laugh broke from his lips but instantly he sobered and his face softened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been for her sake after all and what mattered it if they did send him to the gallows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not sacrificed his honorhe had done his best to assert it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could kill him but they couldnt make him guilty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a thousand juries pronouncing him so could not make it true that he had killed schneider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it would be hard after all his hopes after all the plans he had made to live square to show them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes still boring through the paper suddenly found themselves attracted by something in the text before thema name harding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marriage of barbara daughter of anthony harding the multimillionaire to william mallory will take place on the twentyfifth of june <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the article was dated new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was more but billy did not read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true that he had urged her to marry mallory but now in his lonesomeness and friendlessness he felt almost as though she had been untrue to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come along byrne a bailiff interrupted his thoughts the jurys reached a verdict <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge was emerging from his chambers as billy was led into the courtroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the jury filed in and took their seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foreman handed the clerk a bit of paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even before it was read billy knew that he had been found guilty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not care any longer so he told himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hoped that the judge would send him to the gallows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing more in life for him now anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but instead he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the penitentiary at joliet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was infinitely worse than death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne was appalled at the thought of remaining for life within the grim stone walls of a prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more there swept over him all the old unreasoning hatred of the law and all that pertained to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would like to close his steel fingers about the fat neck of the redfaced judge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the smug jurymen roused within him the lust to kill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the jurymen leaned close to a neighbor and whispered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> society will be safer when he is behind the bars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day they took billy aboard a train bound for joliet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was handcuffed to a deputy sheriff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy was calm outwardly but inwardly he was a raging volcano of hate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a certain very beautiful home on riverside drive new york city a young lady comfortably backed by downy pillows sat in her bed and alternated her attention between coffee and rolls and a morning paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the inside of the main sheet a heading claimed her languid attention chicago murderer given life sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of late chicago had aroused in barbara harding a greater proportion of interest than ever it had in the past and so it was that she now permitted her eyes to wander casually down the printed column <end> <end> 
<start> <start> murderer of harmless old saloon keeper is finally brought to justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the notorious west side rowdy billy byrne apprehended after more than a year as fugitive from justice is sent to joliet for life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barbara harding sat stonyeyed and cold for what seemed many minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with a stifled sob she turned and buried her face in the pillows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train bearing billy byrne and the deputy sheriff toward joliet had covered perhaps half the distance between chicago and billys permanent destination when it occurred to the deputy sheriff that he should like to go into the smoker and enjoy a cigar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now from the moment that he had been sentenced billy byrnes mind had been centered upon one thoughtescape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that there probably would be not the slightest chance for escape but nevertheless the idea was always uppermost in his thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his whole being revolted not alone against the injustice which had sent him into life imprisonment but at the thought of the long years of awful monotony which lay ahead of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deputy sheriff rose and motioning his prisoner ahead of him started for the smoker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first platform they crossed was tightly enclosed but at the second billy saw that a careless porter had left one of the doors open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train was slowing down for some reasonit was going perhaps twenty miles an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy was the first upon the platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the first to see the open door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it meant one of two thingsa chance to escape or death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the latter was to be preferred to life imprisonment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy did not hesitate an instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even before the deputy sheriff realized that the door was open his prisoner had leaped from the moving train dragging his guard after him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne had no time to pick any particular spot to jump for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he did jump he might have been directly over a picket fence or a bottomless pithe did not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it happened he was over neither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the platform chanced to be passing across a culvert at the instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath the culvert was a slimy pool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into this the two men plunged alighting unharmed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne was the first to regain his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dragged the deputy sheriff to his knees and before that frightened and astonished officer of the law could gather his wits together he had been relieved of his revolver and found himself looking into its cold and businesslike muzzle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then billy byrne waded ashore prodding the deputy sheriff in the ribs with cold steel and warning him to silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> above the pool stood a little wood thick with tangled wildwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into this byrne forced his prisoner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they had come deep enough into the concealment of the foliage to make discovery from the outside improbable byrne halted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now say yer prayers he commanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deputy sheriff looked up at him in wildeyed terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint done nothin to you byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> havent i always been your friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatve i ever done to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gods sake byrne you aint goin to murder me are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne let a rather unpleasant smile curl his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he said youse aint done nothin to me but you stand for the law damn it and im going to croak everything i meet that stands for the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wanted to send me up for lifeme an innocent man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you aint no cop but youre just as rotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leveled the revolver at his victims head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deputy sheriff slumped to his knees and tried to embrace billy byrnes legs as he pleaded for his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cut it out you poor boob admonished billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve gotta die and if you was half a man youd wanna die like one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deputy sheriff slipped to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his terror had overcome him leaving him in happy unconsciousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne stood looking down upon the man for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wrist was chained to that of the other and the pull of the deputys body was irritating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne stooped and placed the muzzle of the revolver back of the mans ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he muttered scornfully and his finger tightened upon the trigger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then conjured from nothing there rose between himself and the unconscious man beside him the figure of a beautiful girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her face was brave and smiling and in her eyes was trust and pridewhole worlds of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trust and pride in billy byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy closed his eyes tight as though in physical pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he brushed his hand quickly across his fare <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant do itbut i came awful close to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dropping the revolver into his side pocket he kneeled beside the deputy sheriff and commenced to go through the mans clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a moment he came upon what he soughta key ring confining several keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy found the one he wished and presently he was free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still stood looking at the deputy sheriff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to croak you he murmured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill never make my getaway if i dont but she wont let megod bless her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly a thought came to billy byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he could have a start he might escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wouldnt hurt the man any to stay here for a few hours or even for a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy removed the deputys coat and tore it into strips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with these he bound the man to a tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he fastened a gag in his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the operation the deputy regained consciousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i decided not to croak you explained the young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im just agoin to leave you here for a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll be lookin all along the right o way in a few hoursit wont be long afore they find you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now so long and take care of yerself bo and billy byrne had gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mistake that proved fortunate for billy byrne caused the penitentiary authorities to expect him and his guard by a later train so no suspicion was aroused when they failed to come upon the train they really had started upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gave billy a good two hours start that he would not otherwise have hadan opportunity of which he made good use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore it was that by the time the authorities awoke to the fact that something had happened billy byrne was fifty miles west of joliet bowling along aboard a fast santa fe freight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shortly after night had fallen the train crossed the mississippi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne was hungry and thirsty and as the train slowed down and came to a stop out in the midst of a dark solitude of silent sweetsmelling country billy opened the door of his box car and dropped lightly to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far no one had seen billy since he had passed from the ken of the trussed deputy sheriff and as billy had no desire to be seen he slipped over the edge of the embankment into a dry ditch where he squatted upon his haunches waiting for the train to depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stop out there in the dark night was one of those mysterious stops which trains are prone to make unexplained and doubtless unexplainable by any other than a higher intelligence which directs the movements of men and rolling stock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no town and not even a switch light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently two staccato blasts broke from the engines whistle there was a progressive jerking at coupling pins which started up at the big locomotive and ran rapidly down the length of the train there was the squeaking of brake shoes against wheels and the train moved slowly forward again upon its long journey toward the coast gaining momentum moment by moment until finally the waycar rolled rapidly past the hidden fugitive and the freight rumbled away to be swallowed up in the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it had gone billy rose and climbed back upon the track along which he plodded in the wake of the departing train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somewhere a road would presently cut across the track and along the road there would be farmhouses or a village where food and drink might be found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy was penniless yet he had no doubt but that he should eat when he had discovered food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was thinking of this as he walked briskly toward the west and what he thought of induced a doubt in his mind as to whether it was after all going to be so easy to steal food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he exclaimed half aloud she wouldnt think it wrong for a guy to swipe a little grub when he was starvin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it aint like i was goin to stick a guy up for his roll <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure she wouldnt see nothin wrong for me to get something to eat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they took it all away from me an i got a right to livebut somehow i hate to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wisht there was some other way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gee but shes made a sissy out o me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> funny how a feller can change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i almost like bein a sissy and billy byrne grinned at the almost inconceivable idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before billy came to a road he saw a light down in a little depression at one side of the track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not such a light as a lamp shining beyond a window makes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it rose and fell winking and flaring close to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looked much like a camp fire and as billy drew nearer he saw that such it was and he heard a voice too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must be careful always to see before being seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little fire burned upon the bank of a stream which the track bridged upon a concrete arch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy dropped once more from the right of way and climbed a fence into a thin wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through this he approached the camp fire with small chance of being observed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he neared it the voice resolved itself into articulate words and presently billy leaned against a tree close behind the speaker and listened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was but a single figure beside the small firethat of a man squatting upon his haunches roasting something above the flames <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at one edge of the fire was an empty tin can from which steam arose and an aroma that was now and again wafted to billys nostrils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the voicethat interested billy almost as much as the preparations for the coming meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well dance a merry saraband from here to drowsy samarcand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along the sea across the land the birds are flying south with buds of roses in your hair and kisses on your mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the words took hold of billy somewhere and made him forget his hunger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a sweet incense which induces pleasant daydreams they were wafted in upon him through the rich mellow voice of the solitary camper and the lilt of the meter entered his blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the voice of such as billy byrne always had loathed and ridiculed until he had sat at the feet of barbara harding and learned many things including love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the voice of culture and refinement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy strained his eyes through the darkness to have a closer look at the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light of the camp fire fell upon frayed and bagging clothes and upon the back of a head covered by a shapeless and disreputable soft hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> obviously the man was a hobo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coffee boiling in a discarded tin can would have been proof positive of this without other evidence but there seemed plenty more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes the man was a hobo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mountains are all hid in mist the valley is like amethyst the poplar leaves they turn and twist oh silver silver green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out there somewhere along the sea a ship is waiting patiently while up the beach the bubbles slip with white afloat between <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thought billy byrne but thats great stuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder where he gets it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it makes me want to hike until i find that place hes singin about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billys thoughts were interrupted by a sound in the wood to one side of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he turned his eyes in the direction of the slight noise which had attracted him he saw two men step quietly out and cross toward the man at the camp fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless pals of the poetical one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter did not hear them until they were directly behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he turned slowly and rose as they halted beside his fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evenin bo said one of the newcomers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good evening gentlemen replied the camper welcome to my humble home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naw replied the first speaker we aint but were goin to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now can the chatter an duck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there aint enough fer one here let alone three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the man who was big and burly assumed a menacing attitude and took a truculent step nearer the solitary camper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter was short and slender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the larger man looked as though he might have eaten him at a single mouthful but the camper did not flinch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you induce within me a severe and highly localized pain and furthermore i dont like your whiskers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with which apparently irrelevant remark he seized the matted beard of the larger tramp and struck the fellow a quick sharp blow in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly the fellows companion was upon him but the camper retained his death grip upon the beard of the now yelling bully and continued to rain blow after blow upon head and face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne was an interested spectator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he enjoyed a good fight as he enjoyed little else but presently when the first tramp succeeded in tangling his legs about the legs of his chastiser and dragging him to the ground and the second tramp seized a heavy stick and ran forward to dash the mans brains out billy thought it time to interfere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stepping forward he called aloud as he came cut it out boes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant pull off any rough stuff like that with this here sweet singer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the second tramp raised his stick to strike the now prostrate camper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he spoke billy byrne broke into a run and as the stick fell he reached the mans side and swung a blow to the tramps jaw that sent the fellow spinning backward to the rivers brim where he tottered drunkenly for a moment and then plunged backward into the shallow water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then billy seized the other attacker by the shoulder and dragged him to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you want some too you big stiff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man spluttered and tried to break away striking at billy as he did so but a sudden punch such a punch as billy byrne had once handed the surprised harlem hurricane removed from the mind of the tramp the last vestige of any thought he might have harbored to do the newcomer bodily injury and with it removed all else from the mans mind temporarily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the fellow slumped unconscious to the ground the camper rose to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some wallop you have concealed in your sleeve my friend he said place it there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he extended a slender shapely hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy took it and shook it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it dont get under the ribs like those verses of yours though bo he returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to have insinuated itself beneath this guys thick skull replied the poetical one and its a cinch my verses nor any other would ever get there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tramp who had plumbed the depths of the creeks foot of water and two feet of soft mud was crawling ashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill get youse yet spluttered the moist one through his watery whiskers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ferget it admonished billy an hit the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pointed toward the railroad right of way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an you too john l he added turning to the other victim of his artistic execution who was now sitting up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mumbling and growling the two unwashed shuffled away and were presently lost to view along the vanishing track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the solitary camper had returned to his culinary effort as unruffled and unconcerned apparently as though naught had occurred to disturb his peaceful solitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit down he said after a moment looking up at billy and have a bite to eat with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the louis quatorze is too small and spindlelegged for comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waved his hand invitingly toward the sward beside the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment he was entirely absorbed in the roasting fowl impaled upon a sharp stick which he held in his right hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he presently broke again into verse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in england and the hot old plain from needles to berdoo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we kept arambling all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rustled grub he rustled rhyme blindbaggage hoof it ride or climbwe always put it through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre a good sort he broke off suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there aint many boes that would have done as much for a fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was two against one replied billy an i dont like them odds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where dye get it make it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could do that i wouldnt be panhandling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a guy by the name of henry herbert knibbs did them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they get me right where i live and then after a pause sure you got enough fer two bo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have enough for you old top replied the host even if i only had half as much as i have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here take first crack at the ambrosia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sorry i have but a single cup but james has broken the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i almost feel that i shall have to let him go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh james is my man replied the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy looked up at his companion quizzically then he tasted the dark thick concoction in the tin can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you said it was ambrose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only wished to see if you would recognize it my friend replied the poetical one politely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am highly complimented that you can guess what it is from its taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for several minutes the two ate in silence passing the tin can back and forth and slicinghacking would be more nearly correctpieces of meat from the halfroasted fowl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was billy who broke the silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think said he that you been stringin mebout james and ambrose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not offended i hope said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a sad old world you know and were all looking for amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a guy has no money to buy it with he has to manufacture it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure i aint sore billy assured him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say spiel that part again bout penelope with the kisses on her mouth an you can kid me till the cows come home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the camper by the creek did as billy asked him while the latter sat with his eyes upon the fire seeing in the sputtering little flames the oval face of her who was penelope to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the verse was completed he reached forth his hand and took the tin can in his strong fingers raising it before his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said and drank passing the battered thing over to his new friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the other heres to his knibbs and penelope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poetical one drew a sack of tobacco from his hip pocket and a rumpled package of papers from the pocket of his shirt extending both toward billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint stuck on sponging said billy but maybe i can get even some day and i sure do want a smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint got nothinthey didnt leave me a sou markee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy reached across one end of the fire for the tobacco and cigarette papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he did so the movement bared his wrist and as the firelight fell upon it the marks of the steel bracelet showed vividly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the fall from the train the metal had bitten into the flesh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his companions eyes happened to fall upon the telltale mark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an almost imperceptible raising of the mans eyebrows but he said nothing to indicate that he had noticed anything out of the ordinary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two smoked on for many minutes without indulging in conversation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the camper quoted snatches from service and kipling then he came back to knibbs who was evidently his favorite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked during a momentary lull in the recitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh south or west replied the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nowhere in particularany place suits me just so it isnt north or east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets travel double then said the poetical one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here shake and byrne extended his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until one of us gets wearied of the others company said bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he should have been here long since to turn down my bed and fix my bath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy grinned and rolled over on his side his head uphill and his feet toward the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a couple of feet away bridge paralleled him and in five minutes both were breathing deeply in healthy slumber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five hundred dollars reward we kept arambling all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rustled grub he rustled rhyme quoted billy byrne sitting up and stretching himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his companion roused and came to one elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was topping the scant wood behind them glinting on the surface of the little creek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a robin hopped about the sward quite close to them and from the branch of a tree a hundred yards away came the sweet piping of a song bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farther off were the distancesubdued noises of an awakening farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lowing of cows the crowing of a rooster the yelping of a happy dog just released from a night of captivity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy rose to his feet and shook himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the life said bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats my part o the sketch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the part that has come nearest making me turn respectable than any other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hate to ask for a handout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hed done worse things than that in his life and off he trudged whistling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt happier than he had for many a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never had guessed that the country in the morning could be so beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind him his companion collected the material for a fire washed himself in the creek and set the tin can filled with water at the edge of the kindling and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing to cook so it was useless to light the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he sat there thinking his mind reverted to the red mark upon billys wrist and he made a wry face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy approached the farmhouse from which the sounds of awakening still emanated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the farmer saw him coming and ceasing his activities about the barnyard leaned across a gate and eyed him none too hospitably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanna get something to eat explained billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got any money to pay for it with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said billy but me partner an me are hungry an we gotta eat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the farmer extended a gnarled forefinger and pointed toward the rear of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy looked in the direction thus indicated and espied a woodpile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without a word he crossed to the corded wood picked up an ax which was stuck in a chopping block and shedding his coat went to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half an hour later he stopped on his way in to breakfast and eyed the growing pile that lay beside billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont hev to chop all the wood in the county to get a meal from jed watson he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanna get enough for me partner too explained billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well yewve chopped enough fer two meals son replied the farmer and turning toward the kitchen door he called here maw fix this boy up with suthin teatenough fer a couple of meals fer two on em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as billy walked away toward his camp his arms laden with milk butter eggs a loaf of bread and some cold meat he grinned rather contentedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a year or so ago he mused id a stuck em up fer this an thought i was smart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> funny how a fellerll changean all fer a skirt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a skirt that belongs to somebody else now too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shed be glad if she knew an it makes me feel better to act like shed want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whod ever have taken him fer havin a heart at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wen i seen him first i thought hed like to sic the dog on me an there he comes along an tells maw to pass me a handout like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she used to say that most everybody was decent if you went at em right an i guess she knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord i wish shed been born on grand ave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as billy walked up to his waiting companion who had touched a match to the firewood as he sighted the numerous packages in the foragers arms he was repeating over and over as though the words held him in the thrall of fascination there aint no sweet penelope somewhere thats longing much for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bridge eyed the packages as billy deposited them carefully and one at a time upon the grass beside the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the milk was in a clean little graniteware pail the eggs had been placed in a paper bag while the other articles were wrapped in pieces of newspaper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the opening of each revealed its contents fresh clean and inviting bridge closed one eye and cocked the other up at billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he aint dead as i know of replied billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont mean to say my friend that they let you get away with all this without sicing the dog on you said bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy laughed and explained and the other was relieved the red mark around billys wrist persisted in remaining uppermost in bridges mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they had eaten they lay back upon the grass and smoked some more of bridges tobacco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well inquired bridge whats doing now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my feet are tired and need a change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy gathered together the food they had not yet eaten and made two equalsized packages of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well divide the pack he explained and here drink the rest o this milk i want the pail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are you going to do with the pail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maw just loaned it to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bridge elevated his eyebrows a trifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been mistaken after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the farmhouse the farmers wife greeted them kindly thanked billy for returning her pailwhich if the truth were known she had not expected to see againand gave them each a handful of thick light goldenbrown cookies the tops of which were encrusted with sugar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they walked away bridge sighed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing on earth like a good woman he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no penelope but i did have a mighty fine maw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was thinking of the slovenly bleareyed woman who had brought him into the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the memory was far from pleasant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to shake it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bridge he said quite suddenly and apropos of nothing in an effort to change the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive heard of bridges and bridger but i never heard bridge before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just a name a fellow gave me once up on the yukon explained bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to use a few words hed never heard before so he called me the unabridged which was too long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fellows shortened it to bridge and it stuck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has always stuck and now i havent any other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i even think of myself now as bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes agreed billy and that was the end of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never thought of asking his companions true name any more than bridge would have questioned him as to his or of his past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ethics of the roadside fire and the empty tomato tin do not countenance such impertinences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for several days the two continued their leisurely way toward kansas city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once they rode a few miles on a freight train but for the most part they were content to plod joyously along the dusty highways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy continued to rustle grub while bridge relieved the monotony by an occasional burst of poetry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know so much of that stuff said billy as they were smoking by their camp fire one evening that id think youd be able to make some up yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive tried admitted bridge but there always seems to be something lacking in my stuffit dont get under your belt the divine afflatus is not there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may start out all right but i always end up where i didnt expect to go and where nobody wants to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was one i wrote about a lake where i camped once said bridge reminiscently but i can only recall one stanza <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bet it has knibbs hangin to the ropes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silver are the ripples solemn are the dunes happy are the fishes for they are full of prunes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked up at billy a smile twitching at the corners of his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all right but the last line said billy candidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is something wrong with that last line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess knibbs is safe for another round at least said billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bridge was eying his companion noting the broad shoulders the deep chest the mighty forearm and biceps which the others light cotton shirt could not conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is none of my business he said presently but from your general appearance from bits of idiom you occasionally drop and from the way you handled those two boes the night we met i should rather surmise that at some time or other you had been less than a thousand miles from the wk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seen a prize fight once admitted billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the day before they were due to arrive in kansas city that billy earned a handout from a restaurant keeper in a small town by doing some odd jobs for the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the food he gave billy was wrapped in an old copy of the kansas city star <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when billy reached camp he tossed the package to bridge who in addition to his honorable post as poet laureate was also cook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then billy walked down to the stream nearby that he might wash away the grime and sweat of honest toil from his hands and face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as bridge unwrapped the package and the paper unfolded beneath his eyes an article caught his attentionjust casually at first but presently to the exclusion of all else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he read his eyebrows alternated between a position of considerable elevation to that of a deep frown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he glanced up at billy who was just rising from his ablutions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hastily bridge tore from the paper the article that had attracted his interest folded it and stuffed it into one of his pocketshe had not had time to finish the reading and he wanted to save the article for a later opportunity for careful perusal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that evening bridge sat for a long time scrutinizing billy through halfclosed lids and often he found his eyes wandering to the red ring about the others wrist but whatever may have been within his thoughts he kept to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was noon when the two sauntered into kansas city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy had a dollar in his pocketa whole dollar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had earned it assisting an automobilist out of a ditch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well have a swell feed he had confided to bridge an sleep in a bed just to learn how much nicer it is sleepin out under the black sky and the shiny little stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre a profligate billy said bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dunno what that means said billy but if its something i shoudnt be i probably am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two went to a roominghouse of which bridge knew where they could get a clean room with a double bed for fifty cents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was rather a high price to pay of course but bridge was more or less fastidious and he admitted to billy that hed rather sleep in the clean dirt of the roadside than in the breed of dirt one finds in an unclean bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of the hall was a washroom and toward this bridge made his way after removing his coat and throwing it across the foot of the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after he had left the room billy chanced to notice a folded bit of newspaper on the floor beneath bridges coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he picked it up to lay it on the little table which answered the purpose of a dresser when a single word caught his attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy unfolded the clipping and as his eyes took in the heading a strange expression entered thema hard cold gleam such as had not touched them since the day that he abandoned the deputy sheriff in the woods midway between chicago and joliet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne sentenced to life imprisonment in joliet penitentiary for the murder of schneider the old west side saloon keeper hurled himself from the train that was bearing him to joliet yesterday dragging with him the deputy sheriff to whom he was handcuffed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deputy was found a few hours later bound and gagged lying in the woods along the santa fe not far from lemont <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says that byrne got a good start and doubtless took advantage of it to return to chicago where a man of his stamp could find more numerous and safer retreats than elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was much morea detailed account of the crime for the commission of which billy had been sentenced a full and complete description of billy a record of his long years of transgression and at last the mention of a fivehundreddollar reward that the authorities had offered for information that would lead to his arrest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when billy had concluded the reading he refolded the paper and placed it in a pocket of the coat hanging upon the foot of the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later bridge entered the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy caught himself looking often at his companion and always there came to his mind the termination of the article he had found in bridges pocketthe mention of the fivehundreddollar reward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five hundred dollars thought billy is a lot o coin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i just wonder now and he let his eyes wander to his companion as though he might read upon his face the purpose which lay in the mans heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dont look it but five hundred dollars is a lot o coinfer a bo and wotinell did he have that article hid in his clothes fer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats wot id like to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess its up to me to blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the recently acquired content which had been billys since he had come upon the poetic bridge and the two had made their carefree leisurely way along shaded country roadsides or paused beside cool brooklets that meandered lazily through sweetsmelling meadows was dissipated in the instant that he had realized the nature of the article his companion had been carrying and hiding from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for days no thought of pursuit or capture had arisen to perplex him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seemed such a tiny thing out there amidst the vastness of rolling hills of woods and plain that there had been induced within him an unconscious assurance that no one could find him even though they might seek for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea of meeting a plain clothes man from detective headquarters around the next bend of a peaceful missouri road was so preposterous and incongruous that billy had found it impossible to give the matter serious thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never before had been in the country districts of his native land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to him the united states was all like chicago or new york or milwaukee the three cities with which he was most familiar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his experience of unurban localities had been gained amidst the primeval jungles of faraway yoka <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had been no detective sergeants thereunquestionably there could be none here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> detective sergeants were indigenous to the soil that grew corner saloons and poolrooms and to none otheras well expect to discover one of oda yorimotos samurai hiding behind a fire plug on michigan boulevard as to look for one of those others along a farmbordered road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here in kansas city amidst the noises and odors that meant a large city it was different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the next man he met might be looking for him or if not then the very first policeman they encountered could arrest him upon a word from bridgeand bridge would get five hundred dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a flannel shirt from earths clean dirt here pal is my calloused hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i love each day as a rover may nor seek to understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to enjoy is good enough for me the gypsy of god am i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say he interrupted himself whats the matter with going out now and wrapping ourselves around that swell feed you were speaking of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it didnt seem possible that bridge could be going to doublecross him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a flannel shirt from earths clean dirt here pal is my calloused hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy repeated the lines half aloud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they renewed his confidence in bridge somehow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said billy smore of knibbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on lets go and dine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he grinned at his little joke as he led the way toward the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun already had set but it still was too light for lamps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bridge led the way toward a certain eatingplace of which he knew where a man might dine well and from a clean platter for two bits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy had been keeping his eyes open for detectives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had passed no uniformed policethat would be the crucial test thought heunless bridge intended tipping off headquarters on the quiet and having the pinch made at night after billy had gone to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they reached the little restaurant which was in a basement bridge motioned billy down ahead of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just for an instant he himself paused at the head of the stairs and looked about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he did so a man stepped from the shadow of a doorway upon the opposite side of the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if bridge saw him he apparently gave no sign for he turned slowly and with deliberate steps followed billy down into the eatingplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they entered the place billy who was ahead sought a table but as he was about to hang up his cap and seat himself bridge touched his elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets go to the washroom and clean up a bit he said in a voice that might be heard by those nearest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why we just washed before we left our room expostulated billy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shut up and follow me bridge whispered into his ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hand flew to the pocket in which the gun of the deputy sheriff still rested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would never take him alive of that billy was positive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wouldnt go back to life imprisonment not after he had tasted the sweet freedom of the wide spacessuch a freedom as the trammeled city cannot offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cut it he whispered and follow me as i tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i just saw a chicago dick across the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may not have seen you but it looked almighty like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell be down here in about two seconds now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come onwell beat it through the reari know the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne heaved a great sigh of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he was almost reconciled to the thought of capture for in the instant he had realized that it had not been so much his freedom that he had dreaded to lose as his faith in the companion in whom he had believed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without sign of haste the two walked the length of the room and disappeared through the doorway leading into the washroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before them was a window opening upon a squalid back yard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the building stood upon a hillside so that while the entrance to the eatingplace was below the level of the street in front its rear was flush with the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bridge motioned billy to climb through the window while he shot the bolt upon the inside of the door leading back into the restaurant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later he followed the fugitive and then took the lead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down narrow dirty alleys and through litterpiled back yards he made his way while billy followed at his heels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dusk was gathering and before they had gone far darkness came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they neither paused nor spoke until they had left the business portion of the city behind and were well out of the zone of bright lights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bridge was the first to break the silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you wonder how i knew he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seen that clipping you got in your pocketit fell out on the floor when you took your coat off in the room this afternoon to go and wash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well as far as im concerned thats the end of itwe wont mention it again old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont need to tell you that im for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no not after tonight billy assured him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went on again for some little time without speaking i got two things to tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first is that after i seen that newspaper article in your clothes i thought you was figurin on doublecrossin me an claimin the five hun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to of known better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other is that i didnt kill schneider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wasnt near his place that nightan thats straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im glad you told me both said bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think well understand each other better after thiswere each runnin away from something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in flannel shirt from earths clean dirt here pal is my calloused hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he noticed that bridge hadnt said what he was running away from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy wondered but asked no questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> south they went after they had left the city behind out into the sweet and silent darkness of the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the night they crossed the line into kansas and morning found them in a beautiful hilly country to which all thoughts of cities crime and police seemed so utterly foreign that billy could scarce believe that only a few hours before a chicago detective had been less than a hundred feet from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the new sun burst upon them as they topped a grassy hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dewbespangled blades scintillated beneath the gorgeous rays which would presently sweep them away again into the nothingness from which they had sprung <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he threw his head back and let the warm sun beat down upon his bronzed face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres sunshine in the heart of me my blood sings in the breeze the mountains are a part of me im fellow to the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my golden youth im squandering sunlibertine am i awandering awandering until the day i die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he stood for minutes drinking in deep breaths of the pure sweet air of the new day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside him a head taller savagely strong stood billy byrne his broad shoulders squared his great chest expanding as he inhaled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never knew the country was like this an i dont know that i ever would have known it if it hadnt been for those poet guys youre always spouting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always had an idea they was sissy fellows he went on but a guy cant be a sissy an think the thoughts they musta thought to write stuff that sends the blood chasin through a feller like hed had a drink on an empty stomach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to think everybody was a sissy who wasnt a tough guy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a tough guy all right an i was mighty proud of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint any more an havent been for a long time but before i took a tumble to myself id have hated you bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id ahated your fine talk an your poetry an the thing about you that makes you hate to touch a guy for a handout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id ahated myself if id thought that i could ever talk mushy like i am now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gee bridge but i was the limit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a girla nice girlcalled me a mucker once an a coward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was both but i had the reputation of bein the toughest guy on the west side an i thought i was a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i nearly poked her face for herthink of it bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i nearly did but something stopped mesomething held my hand from it an lately ive liked to think that maybe what stopped me was something in me that had always been theresomething decent that was really a part of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hate to think that i was such a beast at heart as i acted like all my life up to that minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was mighty slow an im still a roughneck but im gettin on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she helped me most of course an now youre helpin me a lot tooyou an your poetry stuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if some dick dont get me i may get to be a human bein before i die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is odd he said how our viewpoints change with changed environment and the passing of the years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time was billy when id have hated you as much as you would have hated me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know that i should have said hate for that is not exactly the word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was more contempt that i felt for men whom i considered as not belonging upon that intellectual or social plane to which i considered i had been born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought of people who moved outside my limited sphere as the great unwashed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pitied them and i honestly believe now that in the bottom of my heart i considered them of different clay than i and with souls if they possessed such things about on a par with the souls of sheep and cows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt have seen the man in you billy then any more than you could have seen the man in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have learned much since then though i still stick to a part of my original articles of faithi do believe that all men are not equal and i know that there are a great many more with whom i would not pal than there are those with whom i would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because one man speaks better english than another or has read more and remembers it only makes him a better man in that particular respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think none the less of you because you cant quote browning or shakespearethe thing that counts is that you can appreciate as i do service and kipling and knibbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now maybe we are both wrongmaybe knibbs and kipling and service didnt write poetry and some people will say as much but whatever it is it gets you and me in the same way and so in this respect we are equals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which being the case lets see if we cant rustle some grub and then find a nice soft spot whereon to pound our respective ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy deciding that he was too sleepy to work for food invested half of the capital that was to have furnished the swell feed the night before in what two bits would purchase from a generous housewife on a nearby farm and then stretching themselves beneath the shade of a tree sufficiently far from the road that they might not attract unnecessary observation they slept until after noon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but their precaution failed to serve their purpose entirely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little before noon two filthy bearded knights of the road clambered laboriously over the fence and headed directly for the very tree under which billy and bridge lay sleeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the minds of the two was the same thought that had induced billy byrne and the poetic bridge to seek this same secluded spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was in the stiff shuffle of the men something rather familiar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have seen them beforejust for a few minutes it is true but under circumstances that impressed some of their characteristics upon us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very last we saw of them they were shuffling away in the darkness along a railroad track after promising that eventually they would wreak dire vengeance upon billy who had just trounced them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now as they came unexpectedly upon the two sleepers they did not immediately recognize in them the objects of their recent hate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they just stood looking stupidly down on them wondering in what way they might turn their discovery to their own advantage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing in the raiment either of billy or bridge indicated that here was any particularly rich field for loot and too the athletic figure of byrne would rather have discouraged any attempt to roll him without first handing him the ko <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the two would have naively put it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as they gazed down upon the features of the sleepers the eyes of one of the tramps narrowed to two ugly slits while those of his companion went wide in incredulity and surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the first and without waiting for a reply he went on dems de guys dat beat us up back dere de udder side o k <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure id know dem in a tousn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> les hand em a couple an beat it and he stooped to pick up a large stone that lay near at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youse dont know dem guys at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dey may be de guys dat beats us up but dat big stiff dere is more dan dat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes wanted in chi an deres half a tou on im <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who put youse jerry to all dat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was in de still wit imhe croaked some guy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on de way to de pen he pushes dis dick offn de rattler an makes his getaway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dat peterboy we meets at quincy slips me an earful about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres were we draws down de five hundred if were cagey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why we leaves em alone an goes to de nex farm an calls up k <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an tips off de dicks see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youse dont tink well get any o dat five hun do youse wit de dicks in on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he said rather dubiously after a moments deep thought dey dont nobody get nothin dat de dicks see first but well get even with dese blokes annyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe deyll pass us a couple bucks said the other hopefully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> detective sergeant flannagan of headquarters chicago slouched in a chair in the private office of the chief of detectives of kansas city missouri <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have said as much himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been sent west to identify a suspect whom the kansas city authorities had arrested but had been unable to do so and had been preparing to return to his home city when the brilliant aureola of an unusual piece of excellent fortune had shone upon him for a moment and then faded away through the grimy entrance of a basement eatingplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been walking along the street the previous evening thinking of nothing in particular but with eyes and ears alert as becomes a successful police officer when he had espied two men approaching upon the opposite sidewalk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something familiar in the swing of the giant frame of one of the men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so true to years of training sergeant flannagan melted into the shadows of a store entrance and waited until the two should have come closer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were directly opposite him when the truth flashed upon himthe big fellow was billy byrne and there was a fivehundreddollar reward out for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the two turned and disappeared down the stairway that led to the underground restaurant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sergeant flannagan saw byrnes companion turn and look back just as flannagan stepped from the doorway to cross the street after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the last sergeant flannagan had seen either of billy byrne or his companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trail had ceased at the open window of the washroom at the rear of the restaurant and search as he would he had been unable to pick it up again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one in kansas city had seen two men that night answering the descriptions flannagan had been able to give at least no one whom flannagan could unearth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he had been forced to take the kansas city chief into his confidence and already a dozen men were scouring such sections of kansas city in which it seemed most likely an escaped murderer would choose to hide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flannagan had been out himself for a while but now he was in to learn what progress if any had been made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had just learned that three suspects had been arrested and was waiting to have them paraded before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the door swung in and the three were escorted into his presence sergeant flannagan gave a snort of disgust indicative probably not only of despair but in a manner registering his private opinion of the mental horse power and efficiency of the kansas city sleuths for of the three one was a pastyfaced chestless youth even then under the influence of cocaine another was an old bewhiskered hobo while the third was unquestionably a chinaman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even professional courtesy could scarce restrain sergeant flannagans desire toward bitter sarcasm and he was upon the point of launching forth into a vitriolic arraignment of everything west of chicago up to and including specifically the kansas city detective bureau when the telephone bell at the chiefs desk interrupted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had wanted the chief to hear just what he thought so he waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chief listened for a few minutes asked several questions and then placing a fat hand over the transmitter he wheeled about toward flannagan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he said i guess i got something for you at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a bo on the wire that says hes just seen your man down near shawnee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wants to know if youll split the reward with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose he said ironically that if i go down there ill find hes corraled a nigger and he looked sorrowfully at the three specimens before him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this guy says he knows byrne well an that hes got it in for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall i tell him youll be downand split the reward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him ill be down and that ill treat him right replied flannagan and after the chief had transmitted the message and hung up the receiver where is this here shawnee anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill send a couple of men along with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt far across the line an there wont be no trouble in getting back without nobody knowin anything about itif you get him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all right said flannagan his visions of five hundred already dwindled to a possible one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was but a little past one oclock that a touring car rolled south out of kansas city with detective sergeant flannagan in the front seat with the driver and two burly representatives of missouri law in the back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the two tramps approached the farmhouse at which billy had purchased food a few hours before the farmers wife called the dog that was asleep in the summer kitchen and took a shotgun down from its hook beside the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from long experience the lady was a reader of character of hobo character at leastand she saw nothing in the appearance of either of these two that inspired even a modicum of confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the young fellow who had been there earlier in the day and who wonder of wonders had actually paid for the food she gave him had been of a different stamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his clothing had proclaimed him a tramp but thanks to the razor bridge always carried he was clean shaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his year of total abstinence bad given him clear eyes and a healthy skin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a freshness and vigor in his appearance and carriage that inspired confidence rather than suspicion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not mistrusted him but these others she did mistrust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they asked to use the telephone she refused and ordered them away thinking it but an excuse to enter the house but they argued the matter explaining that they had discovered an escaped murderer hiding nearbyin fact in her own meadowand that they wished only to call up the kansas city police <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally she yielded but kept the dog by her side and the shotgun in her hand while the two entered the room and crossed to the telephone upon the opposite side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the conversation which she overheard the woman concluded that after all she had been mistaken not only about these two but about the young man who had come earlier in the day and purchased food from her for the description the tramp gave of the fugitive tallied exactly with that of the young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed incredible that so honest looking a man could be a murderer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the good woman was shocked and not a little unstrung by the thought that she had been in the house alone when he had come and that if he had wished to he could easily have murdered her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope they get him she said when the tramp had concluded his talk with kansas city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its awful the carryings on they is nowadays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why a body cant never tell who to trust and i thought him such a nice young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he paid me for what he got too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dog bored by the inaction had wandered back into the summer kitchen and resumed his broken slumber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the tramps was leaning against the wall talking with the farmer woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other was busily engaged in scratching his right shin with what remained of the heel of his left shoe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he supported himself with one hand on a small table upon the top of which was a family bible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite unexpectedly he lost his balance the table tipped he was thrown still farther over toward it and all in the flash of an eye tramp table and family bible crashed to the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a little cry of alarm the woman rushed forward to gather up the holy book in her haste forgetting the shotgun and leaving it behind her leaning against the arm of a chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost simultaneously the two tramps saw the real cause of her perturbation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the large book had fallen upon its back open and as several of the leaves turned over before coming to rest their eyes went wide at what was revealed between <end> <end> 
<start> <start> united states currency in denominations of five ten and twentydollar bills lay snugly inserted between the leaves of the bible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tramp who lay on the floor as yet too surprised to attempt to rise rolled over and seized the book as a football player seizes the pigskin after a fumble covering it with his body his arms and sticking out his elbows as a further protection to the invaluable thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the first cry of the woman the dog rose growling and bounded into the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tramp leaning against the wall saw the brute cominga mongrel hounddog bristling and savage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shotgun stood almost within the mans reacha step and it was in his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as though sensing the fellows intentions the dog wheeled from the tramp upon the floor toward whom he had leaped and sprang for the other ragged scoundrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the muzzle of the gun met him halfway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dog collapsed to the floor his chest torn out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the woman began to scream for help but in an instant both the tramps were upon her choking her to silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them ran to the summer kitchen returning a moment later with a piece of clothesline while the other sat astride the victim his fingers closed about her throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once he released his hold and she screamed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she was secured and gagged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the two commenced to rifle the bible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eleven hundred dollars in bills were hidden there because the woman and her husband didnt believe in banksthe savings of a lifetime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in agony as she regained consciousness she saw the last of their little hoard transferred to the pockets of the tramps and when they had finished they demanded to know where she kept the rest loosening her gag that she might reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told them that that was all the money she had in the world and begged them not to take it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youseve got more coin dan dis growled one of the men an youse had better pass it over or well find a way to make youse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still she insisted that that was all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tramp stepped into the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wood fire was burning in the stove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pair of pliers lay upon the window sill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with these he lifted one of the hot stovehole covers and returned to the parlor grinning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess shell remember shes got more wen dis begins to woik he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de dicksll be here in a little while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wed better be makin our getaway wid wat we got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i clean forgot all about de dicks and then after a moments silence during which his evil face underwent various changes of expression from fear to final relief he turned an ugly crooked grimace upon his companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got to croak her he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if dey finds her alive shell blab sure an dey wont be no trouble bout gettin us or identifyin us neither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant moren do time fer dis job if we stop now but de udderll mean and he made a suggestive circle with a grimy finger close to his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no it wont nothin of de kind urged his companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got it all doped out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got lots o time before de dicks are due <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well croak de skirt an den well beat it up de road an meet de dickssee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we meets de dicks innocentlike but first we caches de dough in de woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we tells em we hurried right on to lead em to dis byrne guy an wen we gets back here to de farmhouse an finds wots happened here well be as flabbergasted as dey be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youse dont tink youse can put dat over on any wise guy from chi do youse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who will dey tink croaked de old woman an de kiyi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he smiled at himself for fancying such a thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not seriously think that this was the cow because she went along so quietly behaving just like any other cow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently she neither knew nor cared so much as a wisp of hay about cadmus and was only thinking how to get her living along the wayside where the herbage was green and fresh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps she was going home to be milked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted to come up with the cow so as to examine her and see if she would appear to know him or whether there were any peculiarities to distinguish her from a thousand other cows whose only business is to fill the milkpail and sometimes kick it over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still the brindled cow trudged on whisking her tail to keep the flies away and taking as little notice of cadmus as she well could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he walked slowly so did the cow and seized the opportunity to graze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he quickened his pace the cow went just so much the faster and once when cadmus tried to catch her by running she threw out her heels stuck her tail straight on end and set off at a gallop looking as queerly as cows generally do while putting themselves to their speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when cadmus saw that it was impossible to come up with her he walked on moderately as before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cow too went leisurely on without looking behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherever the grass was greenest there she nibbled a mouthful or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where a brook glistened brightly across the path there the cow drank and breathed a comfortable sigh and drank again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and trudged onward at the pace that best suited herself and cadmus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do believe thought cadmus that this may be the cow that was foretold me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it be the one i suppose she will lie down somewhere hereabouts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether it were the oracular cow or some other one it did not seem reasonable that she should travel a great way farther <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so whenever they reached a particularly pleasant spot on a breezy hillside or in a sheltered vale or flowery meadow on the shore of a calm lake or along the bank of a clear stream cadmus looked eagerly around to see if the situation would suit him for a home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still whether he liked the place or no the brindled cow never offered to lie down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on she went at the quiet pace of a cow going homeward to the barn yard and every moment cadmus expected to see a milkmaid approaching with a pail or a herdsman running to head the stray animal and turn her back towards the pasture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no milkmaid came no herdsman drove her back and cadmus followed the stray brindle till he was almost ready to drop down with fatigue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o brindled cow cried he in a tone of despair do you never mean to stop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had now grown too intent on following her to think of lagging behind however long the way and whatever might be his fatigue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed it seemed as if there were something about the animal that bewitched people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several persons who happened to see the brindled cow and cadmus following behind began to trudge after her precisely as he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cadmus was glad of somebody to converse with and therefore talked very freely to these good people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told them all his adventures and how he had left king agenor in his palace and phoenix at one place and cilix at another and thasus at a third and his dear mother queen telephassa under a flowery sod so that now he was quite alone both friendless and homeless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he mentioned likewise that the oracle had bidden him be guided by a cow and inquired of the strangers whether they supposed that this brindled animal could be the one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why tis a very wonderful affair answered one of his new companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am pretty well acquainted with the ways of cattle and i never knew a cow of her own accord to go so far without stopping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if my legs will let me ill never leave following the beast till she lies down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she goes a hundred miles farther i am determined to see the end of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the secret of it was you must know that the cow was an enchanted cow and that without their being conscious of it she threw some of her enchantment over everybody that took so much as half a dozen steps behind her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not possibly help following her though all the time they fancied themselves doing it of their own accord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cow was by no means very nice in choosing her path so that sometimes they had to scramble over rocks or wade through mud and mire and all in a terribly bedraggled condition and tired to death and very hungry into the bargain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a weary business it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but still they kept trudging stoutly forward and talking as they went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strangers grew very fond of cadmus and resolved never to leave him but to help him build a city wherever the cow might lie down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the center of it there should be a noble palace in which cadmus might dwell and be their king with a throne a crown a sceptre a purple robe and everything else that a king ought to have for in him there was the royal blood and the royal heart and the head that knew how to rule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while they were talking of these schemes and beguiling the tediousness of the way with laying out the plan of the new city one of the company happened to look at the cow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindle is going to lie down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all looked and sure enough the cow had stopped and was staring leisurely about her as other cows do when on the point of lying down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and slowly slowly did she recline herself on the soft grass first bending her forelegs and then crouching her hind ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when cadmus and his companions came up with her there was the brindled cow taking her ease chewing her cud and looking them quietly in the face as if this was just the spot she had been seeking for and as if it were all a matter of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this then said cadmus gazing around him this is to be my home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a fertile and lovely plain with great trees flinging their sunspeckled shadows over it and hills fencing it in from the rough weather at no great distance they beheld a river gleaming in the sunshine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a home feeling stole into the heart of poor cadmus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very glad to know that here he might awake in the morning without the necessity of putting on his dusty sandals to travel farther and farther <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the days and the years would pass over him and find him still in this pleasant spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he could have had his brothers with him and his friend thasus and could have seen his dear mother under a roof of his own he might here have been happy after all their disappointments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some day or other too his sister europa might have come quietly to the door of his home and smiled round upon the familiar faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but indeed since there was no hope of regaining the friends of his boyhood or ever seeing his dear sister again cadmus resolved to make himself happy with these new companions who had grown so fond of him while following the cow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes my friends said he to them this is to be our home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we will build our habitations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brindled cow which has led us hither will supply us with milk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will cultivate the neighboring soil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and lead an innocent and happy life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his companions joyfully assented to this plan and in the first place being very hungry and thirsty they looked about them for the means of providing a comfortable meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not far off they saw a tuft of trees which appeared as if there might be a spring of water beneath them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went thither to fetch some leaving cadmus stretched on the ground along with the brindled cow for now that he had found a place of rest it seemed as if all the weariness of his pilgrimage ever since he left king agenors palace had fallen upon him at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his new friends had not long been gone when he was suddenly startled by cries shouts and screams and the noise of a terrible struggle and in the midst of it all a most awful hissing which went right through his ears like a rough saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> running towards the tuft of trees he beheld the head and fiery eyes of an immense serpent or dragon with the widest jaws that ever a dragon had and a vast many rows of horribly sharp teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before cadmus could reach the spot this pitiless reptile had killed his poor companions and was busily devouring them making but a mouthful of each man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appears that the fountain of water was enchanted and that the dragon had been set to guard it so that no mortal might ever quench his thirst there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the neighboring inhabitants carefully avoided the spot it was now a long time not less than a hundred years or thereabouts since the monster had broken his fast and as was natural enough his appetite had grown to be enormous and was not half satisfied by the poor people whom he had just eaten up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he caught sight of cadmus therefore he set up another abominable hiss and flung back his immense jaws until his mouth looked like a great red cavern at the farther end of which were seen the legs of his last victim whom he had hardly had time to swallow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but cadmus was so enraged at the destruction of his friends that he cared neither for the size of the dragons jaws nor for his hundreds of sharp teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> drawing his sword he rushed at the monster and flung himself right into his cavernous mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this bold method of attacking him took the dragon by surprise for in fact cadmus had leaped so far down into his throat that the rows of terrible teeth could not close upon him nor do him the least harm in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus though the struggle was a tremendous one and though the dragon shattered the tuft of trees into small splinters by the lashing of his tail yet as cadmus was all the while slashing and stabbing at his very vitals it was not long before the scaly wretch bethought himself of slipping away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not gone his length however when the brave cadmus gave him a sword thrust that finished the battle and creeping out of the gateway of the creatures jaws there he beheld him still wriggling his vast bulk although there was no longer life enough in him to harm a little child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but do not you suppose that it made cadmus sorrowful to think of the melancholy fate which had befallen those poor friendly people who had followed the cow along with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed as if he were doomed to lose everybody whom he loved or to see them perish in one way or another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here he was after all his toils and troubles in a solitary place with not a single human being to help him build a hut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it were better for me to have been devoured by the dragon as my poor companions were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cadmus said a voice but whether it came from above or below him or whether it spoke within his own breast the young man could not tellcadmus pluck out the dragons teeth and plant them in the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a strange thing to do nor was it very easy i should imagine to dig out all those deeprooted fangs from the dead dragons jaws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but cadmus toiled and tugged and after pounding the monstrous head almost to pieces with a great stone he at last collected as many teeth as might have filled a bushel or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next thing was to plant them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this likewise was a tedious piece of work especially as cadmus was already exhausted with killing the dragon and knocking his head to pieces and had nothing to dig the earth with that i know of unless it were his sword blade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally however a sufficiently large tract o ground was turned up and sown with this new kind of seed although half of the dragons teeth still remained to be planted some other day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cadmus quite out of breath stood leaning upon his sword and wondering what was to happen next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had waited but a few moments when he began to see a sight which was as great a marvel as the most marvelous thing i ever told you about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was shining slantwise over the field and showed all the moist dark soil just like any other newlyplanted piece of ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all at once cadmus fancied he saw something glisten very brightly first at one spot then at another and then at a hundred and a thousand spots together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon he perceived them to be the steel heads of spears sprouting up everywhere like so many stalks of grain and continually growing taller and taller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next appeared a vast number of bright sword blades thrusting themselves up in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment afterwards the whole surface of the ground was broken by a multitude of polished brass helmets coming up like a crop of enormous beans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so rapidly did they grow that cadmus now discerned the fierce countenance of a man beneath every one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short before he had time to think what a wonderful affair it was he beheld an abundant harvest of what looked like human beings armed with helmets and breastplates shields swords and spears and before they were well out of the earth they brandished their weapons and clashed them one against another seeming to think little while as they had yet lived that they had wasted too much of life without a battle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every tooth of the dragon had produced one of these sons of deadly mischief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up sprouted also a great many trumpeters and with the first breath that they drew they put their brazen trumpets to their lips and sounded a tremendous and earshattering blast so that the whole space just now so quiet and solitary reverberated with the clash and clang of arms the bray of warlike music and the shouts of angry men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so enraged did they all look that cadmus fully expected them to put the whole world to the sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how fortunate would it be for a great conqueror if he could get a bushel of the dragons teeth to sow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cadmus said the same voice which he had before heard throw a stone into the midst of the armed men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so cadmus seized a large stone and flinging it into the middle of the earth army saw it strike the breastplate of a gigantic and fiercelooking warrior <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately on feeling the blow he seemed to take it for granted that somebody had struck him and uplifting his weapon he smote his next neighbor a blow that cleft his helmet asunder and stretched him on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant those nearest the fallen warrior began to strike at one another with their swords and stab with their spears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the confusion spread wider and wider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each man smote down his brother and was himself smitten down before he had time to exult in his victory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trumpeters all the while blew their blasts shriller and shriller each soldier shouted a battle cry and often fell with it on his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the strangest spectacle of causeless wrath and of mischief for no good end that had ever been witnessed but after all it was neither more foolish nor more wicked than a thousand battles that have since been fought in which men have slain their brothers with just as little reason as these children of the dragons teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it ought to be considered too that the dragon people were made for nothing else whereas other mortals were born to love and help one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well this memorable battle continued to rage until the ground was strewn with helmeted heads that had been cut off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all the thousands that began the fight there were only five left standing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these now rushed from different parts of the field and meeting in the middle of it clashed their swords and struck at each others hearts as fiercely as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cadmus said the voice again bid those five warriors sheathe their swords <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will help you to build the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without hesitating an instant cadmus stepped forward with the aspect of a king and a leader and extending his drawn sword amongst them spoke to the warriors in a stern and commanding voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and forthwith feeling themselves bound to obey him the five remaining sons of the dragons teeth made him a military salute with their swords returned them to the scabbards and stood before cadmus in a rank eyeing him as soldiers eye their captain while awaiting the word of command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these five men had probably sprung from the biggest of the dragons teeth and were the boldest and strongest of the whole army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were almost giants indeed and had good need to be so else they never could have lived through so terrible a fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they still had a very furious look and if cadmus happened to glance aside would glare at one another with fire flashing out of their eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was strange too to observe how the earth out of which they had so lately grown was incrusted here and there on their bright breastplates and even begrimed their faces just as you may have seen it clinging to beets and carrots when pulled out of their native soil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cadmus hardly knew whether to consider them as men or some odd kind of vegetable although on the whole he concluded that there was human nature in them because they were so fond of trumpets and weapons and so ready to shed blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they looked him earnestly in the face waiting for his next order and evidently desiring no other employment than to follow him from one battlefield to another all over the wide world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but cadmus was wiser than these earthborn creatures with the dragons fierceness in them and knew better how to use their strength and hardihood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quarry some stones with those great swords of yours and help me to build a city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the five soldiers grumbled a little and muttered that it was their business to overthrow cities not to build them up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but cadmus looked at them with a stern eye and spoke to them in a tone of authority so that they knew him for their master and never again thought of disobeying his commands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they set to work in good earnest and toiled so diligently that in a very short time a city began to make its appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first to be sure the workmen showed a quarrelsome disposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like savage beasts they would doubtless have done one another a mischief if cadmus had not kept watch over them and quelled the fierce old serpent that lurked in their hearts when he saw it gleaming out of their wild eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in course of time they got accustomed to honest labor and had sense enough to feel that there was more true enjoyment in living at peace and doing good to ones neighbor than in striking at him with a twoedged sword <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may not be too much to hope that the rest of mankind will by and by grow as wise and peaceable as these five earthbegrimed warriors who sprang from the dragons teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now the city was built and there was a home in it for each of the workmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the palace of cadmus was not yet erected because they had left it till the last meaning to introduce all the new improvements of architecture and make it very commodious as well as stately and beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after finishing the rest of their labors they all went to bed betimes in order to rise in the gray of the morning and get at least the foundation of the edifice laid before nightfall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when cadmus arose and took his way towards the site where the palace was to be built followed by his five sturdy workmen marching all in a row what do you think he saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what should it be but the most magnificent palace that had ever been seen in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was built of marble and other beautiful kinds of stone and rose high into the air with a splendid dome and a portico along the front and carved pillars and everything else that befitted the habitation of a mighty king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had grown up out of the earth in almost as short a time as it had taken the armed host to spring from the dragons teeth and what made the matter more strange no seed of this stately edifice ever had been planted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the five workmen beheld the dome with the morning sunshine making it look golden and glorious they gave a great shout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long live king cadmus they cried in his beautiful palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the new king with his five faithful followers at his heels shouldering their pickaxes and marching in a rank for they still had a soldierlike sort of behavior as their nature was ascended the palace steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> halting at the entrance they gazed through a long vista of lofty pillars that were ranged from end to end of a great hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the farther extremity of this hall approaching slowly towards him cadmus beheld a female figure wonderfully beautiful and adorned with a royal robe and a crown of diamonds over her golden ringlets and the richest necklace that ever a queen wore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fancied it his longlost sister europa now grown to womanhood coming to make him happy and to repay him with her sweet sisterly affection for all those weary wonderings in quest of her since he left king agenors palacefor the tears that he had shed on parting with phoenix and cilix and thasusfor the heartbreakings that had made the whole world seem dismal to him over his dear mothers grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as cadmus advanced to meet the beautiful stranger he saw that her features were unknown to him although in the little time that it required to tread along the hall he had already felt a sympathy betwixt himself and her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no cadmus said the same voice that had spoken to him in the field of the armed men this is not that dear sister europa whom you have sought so faithfully all over the wide world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is harmonia a daughter of the sky who is given you instead of sister and brothers and friend and mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will find all those dear ones in her alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so king cadmus dwelt in the palace with his new friend harmonia and found a great deal of comfort in his magnificent abode but would doubtless have found as much if not more in the humblest cottage by the wayside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before many years went by there was a group of rosy little children but how they came thither has always been a mystery to me sporting in the great hall and on the marble steps of the palace and running joyfully to meet king cadmus when affairs of state left him at leisure to play with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they called him father and queen harmonia mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the five old soldiers of the dragons teeth grew very fond of these small urchins and were never weary of showing them how to shoulder sticks flourish wooden swords and march in military order blowing a penny trumpet or beating an abominable rubadub upon a little drum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but king cadmus lest there should be too much of the dragons tooth in his childrens disposition used to find time from his kingly duties to teach them their a b cwhich he invented for their benefit and for which many little people i am afraid are not half so grateful to him as they ought to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of you have heard no doubt of the wise king ulysses and how he went to the siege of troy and how after that famous city was taken and burned he spent ten long years in trying to get back again to his own little kingdom of ithaca <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at one time in the course of this weary voyage he arrived at an island that looked very green and pleasant but the name of which was unknown to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for only a little while before he came thither he had met with a terrible hurricane or rather a great many hurricanes at once which drove his fleet of vessels into a strange part of the sea where neither himself nor any of his mariners had ever sailed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this misfortune was entirely owing to the foolish curiosity of his shipmates who while ulysses lay asleep had untied some very bulky leathern bags in which they supposed a valuable treasure to be concealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in each of these stout bags king aeolus the ruler of the winds had tied up a tempest and had given it to ulysses to keep in order that he might be sure of a favorable passage homeward to ithaca and when the strings were loosened forth rushed the whistling blasts like air out of a blown bladder whitening the sea with foam and scattering the vessels nobody could tell whither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately after escaping from this peril a still greater one had befallen him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scudding before the hurricane he reached a place which as he afterwards found was called laestrygonia where some monstrous giants had eaten up many of his companions and had sunk every one of his vessels except that in which he himself sailed by flinging great masses of rock at them from the cliffs along the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after going through such troubles as these you cannot wonder that king ulysses was glad to moor his tempestbeaten bark in a quiet cove of the green island which i began with telling you about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had encountered so many dangers from giants and oneeyed cyclops and monsters of the sea and land that he could not help dreading some mischief even in this pleasant and seemingly solitary spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for two days therefore the poor weatherworn voyagers kept quiet and either staid on board of their vessel or merely crept along under the cliffs that bordered the shore and to keep themselves alive they dug shellfish out of the sand and sought for any little rill of fresh water that might be running towards the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the two days were spent they grew very weary of this kind of life for the followers of king ulysses as you will find it important to remember were terrible gormandizers and pretty sure to grumble if they missed their regulars meals and their irregular ones besides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their stock of provisions was quite exhausted and even the shellfish began to get scarce so that they had now to choose between starving to death or venturing into the interior of the island where perhaps some huge threeheaded dragon or other horrible monster had his den <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such misshapen creatures were very numerous in those days and nobody ever expected to make a voyage or take a journey without running more or less risk of being devoured by them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but king ulysses was a bold man as well as a prudent one and on the third morning he determined to discover what sort of a place the island was and whether it were possible to obtain a supply of food for the hungry mouths of his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so taking a spear in his hand he clambered to the summit of a cliff and gazed round about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at a distance towards the center of the island he beheld the stately towers of what seemed to be a palace built of snowwhite marble and rising in the midst of a grove of lofty trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thick branches of these trees stretched across the front of the edifice and more than half concealed it although from the portion which he saw ulysses judged it to be spacious and exceedingly beautiful and probably the residence of some great nobleman or prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a blue smoke went curling up from the chimney and was almost the pleasantest part of the spectacle to ulysses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for from the abundance of this smoke it was reasonable to conclude that there was a good fire in the kitchen and that at dinnertime a plentiful banquet would be served up to the inhabitants of the palace and to whatever guests might happen to drop in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with so agreeable a prospect before him ulysses fancied that he could not do better than go straight to the palace gate and tell the master of it that there was a crew of poor shipwrecked mariners not far off who had eaten nothing for a day or two save a few clams and oysters and would therefore be thankful for a little food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the prince or nobleman must be a very stingy curmudgeon to be sure if at least when his own dinner was over he would not bid them welcome to the broken victuals from the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pleasing himself with this idea king ulysses had made a few steps in the direction of the palace when there was a great twittering and chirping from the branch of a neighboring tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment afterwards a bird came flying towards him and hovered in the air so as almost to brush his face with its wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a very pretty little bird with purple wings and body and yellow legs and a circle of golden feathers round its neck and on its head a golden tuft which looked like a kings crown in miniature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ulysses tried to catch the bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it fluttered nimbly out of his reach still chirping in a piteous tone as if it could have told a lamentable story had it only been gifted with human language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he attempted to drive it away the bird flew no farther than the bough of the next tree and again came fluttering about his head with its doleful chirp as soon as he showed a purpose of going forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you anything to tell me little bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he was ready to listen attentively to whatever the bird might communicate for at the siege of troy and elsewhere he had known such odd things to happen that he would not have considered it much out of the common run had this little feathered creature talked as plainly as himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the bird peep peep peweep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and nothing else would it say but only peep peep peweep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a melancholy cadence and over and over and over again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as often as ulysses moved forward however the bird showed the greatest alarm and did its best to drive him back with the anxious flutter of its purple wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its unaccountable behavior made him conclude at last that the bird knew of some danger that awaited him and which must needs be very terrible beyond all question since it moved even a little fowl to feel compassion for a human being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he resolved for the present to return to the vessel and tell his companions what he had seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this appeared to satisfy the bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as ulysses turned back it ran up the trunk of a tree and began to pick insects out of the bark with its long sharp bill for it was a kind of woodpecker you must know and had to get its living in the same manner as other birds of that species <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but every little while as it pecked at the bark of the tree the purple bird bethought itself of some secret sorrow and repeated its plaintive note of peep peep peweep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his way to the shore ulysses had the good luck to kill a large stag by thrusting his spear into his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking it on his shoulders for he was a remarkably strong man he lugged it along with him and flung it down before his hungry companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have already hinted to you what gormandizers some of the comrades of king ulysses were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from what is related of them i reckon that their favorite diet was pork and that they had lived upon it until a good part of their physical substance was swines flesh and their tempers and dispositions were very much akin to the hog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dish of venison however was no unacceptable meal to them especially after feeding so long on oysters and clams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so beholding the dead stag they felt of its ribs in a knowing way and lost no time in kindling a fire of driftwood to cook it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the day was spent in feasting and if these enormous eaters got up from table at sunset it was only because they could not scrape another morsel off the poor animals bones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning their appetites were as sharp as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they looked at ulysses as if they expected him to clamber up the cliff again and come back with another fat deer upon his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of setting out however he summoned the whole crew together and told them it was in vain to hope that he could kill a stag every day for their dinner and therefore it was advisable to think of some other mode of satisfying their hunger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said he when i was on the cliff yesterday i discovered that this island is inhabited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at a considerable distance from the shore stood a marble palace which appeared to be very spacious and had a great deal of smoke curling out of one of its chimneys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> muttered some of his companions smacking their lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that smoke must have come from the kitchen fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a good dinner on the spit and no doubt there will be as good a one today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but continued the wise ulysses you must remember my good friends our misadventure in the cavern of oneeyed polyphemus the cyclops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of his ordinary milk diet did he not eat up two of our comrades for his supper and a couple more for breakfast and two at his supper again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> methinks i see him yet the hideous monster scanning us with that great red eye in the middle of his forehead to single out the fattest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then again only a few days ago did we not fall into the hands of the king of the laestrygons and those other horrible giants his subjects who devoured a great many more of us than are now left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to tell you the truth if we go to yonder palace there can be no question that we shall make our appearance at the dinner table but whether seated as guests or served up as food is a point to be seriously considered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either way murmured some of the hungriest of the crew it will be better than starvation particularly if one could be sure of being well fattened beforehand and daintily cooked afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a matter of taste said king ulysses and for my own part neither the most careful fattening nor the daintiest of cookery would reconcile me to being dished at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my proposal is therefore that we divide ourselves into two equal parties and ascertain by drawing lots which of the two shall go to the palace and beg for food and assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if these can be obtained all is well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if not and if the inhabitants prove as inhospitable as polyphemus or the laestrygons then there will but half of us perish and the remainder may set sail and escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as nobody objected to this scheme ulysses proceeded to count the whole band and found that there were fortysix men including himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then numbered off twentytwo of them and put eurylochus who was one of his chief officers and second only to himself in sagacity at their head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ulysses took command of the remaining twentytwo men in person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then taking off his helmet he put two shells into it on one of which was written go and on the other stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another person now held the helmet while ulysses and eurylochus drew out each a shell and the word go was found written on that which eurylochus had drawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this manner it was decided that ulysses and his twentytwo men were to remain at the seaside until the other party should have found out what sort of treatment they might expect at the mysterious palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as there was no help for it eurylochus immediately set forth at the head of his twentytwo followers who went off in a very melancholy state of mind leaving their friends in hardly better spirits than themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner had they clambered up the cliff than they discerned the tall marble towers of the palace ascending as white as snow out of the lovely green shadow of the trees which surrounded it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gush of smoke came from a chimney in the rear of the edifice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this vapor rose high in the air and meeting with a breeze was wafted seaward and made to pass over the heads of the hungry mariners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when peoples appetites are keen they have a very quick scent for anything savory in the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that smoke comes from the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried one of them turning up his nose as high as he could and snuffing eagerly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as sure as im a halfstarved vagabond i smell roast meat in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us make haste cried the others or we shall be too late for the good cheer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but scarcely had they made half a dozen steps from the edge of the cliff when a bird came fluttering to meet them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the same pretty little bird with the purple wings and body the yellow legs the golden collar round its neck and the crownlike tuft upon its head whose behavior had so much surprised ulysses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it hovered about eurylochus and almost brushed his face with its wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so plaintively intelligent was the sound that it seemed as if the little creature were going to break its heart with some mighty secret that it had to tell and only this one poor note to tell it with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my pretty bird said eurylochusfor he was a wary person and let no token of harm escape his noticemy pretty bird who sent you hither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what is the message which you bring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it flew towards the edge of the cliff and looked around at them as if exceedingly anxious that they should return whence they came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eurylochus and a few of the others were inclined to turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not help suspecting that the purple bird must be aware of something mischievous that would befall them at the palace and the knowledge of which affected its airy spirit with a human sympathy and sorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the rest of the voyagers snuffing up the smoke from the palace kitchen ridiculed the idea of returning to the vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them more brutal than his fellows and the most notorious gormandizer in the crew said such a cruel and wicked thing that i wonder the mere thought did not turn him into a wild beast in shape as he already was in his nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this troublesome and impertinent little fowl said he would make a delicate titbit to begin dinner with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just one plump morsel melting away between the teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he comes within my reach ill catch him and give him to the palace cook to be roasted on a skewer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the words were hardly out of his mouth before the purple bird flew away crying peep peep peweep more dolorously than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that bird remarked eurylochus knows more than we do about what awaits us at the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on then cried his comrades and well soon know as much as he does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the party accordingly went onward through the green and pleasant wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every little while they caught new glimpses of the marble palace which looked more and more beautiful the nearer they approached it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they soon entered a broad pathway which seemed to be very neatly kept and which went winding along with streaks of sunshine falling across it and specks of light quivering among the deepest shadows that fell from the lofty trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was bordered too with a great many sweetsmelling flowers such as the mariners had never seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so rich and beautiful they were that if the shrubs grew wild here and were native in the soil then this island was surely the flower garden of the whole earth or if transplanted from some other clime it must have been from the happy islands that lay towards the golden sunset <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there has been a great deal of pains foolishly wasted on these flowers observed one of the company and i tell you what he said that you may keep in mind what gormandizers they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my part if i were the owner of the palace i would bid my gardener cultivate nothing but savory pot herbs to make a stuffing for roast meat or to flavor a stew with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ill warrant you theres a kitchen garden in the rear of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at one place they came to a crystal spring and paused to drink at it for want of liquor which they liked better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking into its bosom they beheld their own faces dimly reflected but so extravagantly distorted by the gush and motion of the water that each one of them appeared to be laughing at himself and all his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so ridiculous were these images of themselves indeed that they did really laugh aloud and could hardly be grave again as soon as they wished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after they had drank they grew still merrier than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has a twang of the wine cask in it said one smacking his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried his fellows well find the wine cask itself at the palace and that will be better than a hundred crystal fountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they quickened their pace and capered for joy at the thought of the savory banquet at which they hoped to be guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but eurylochus told them that he felt as if he were walking in a dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i am really awake continued he then in my opinion we are on the point of meeting with some stranger adventure than any that befell us in the cave of polyphemus or among the gigantic maneating laestrygons or in the windy palace of king aeolus which stands on a brazenwalled island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this kind of dreamy feeling always comes over me before any wonderful occurrence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you take my advice you will turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no answered his comrades snuffing the air in which the scent from the palace kitchen was now very perceptible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we would not turn back though we were certain that the king of the laestrygons as big as a mountain would sit at the head of the table and huge polyphemus the oneeyed cyclops at its foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length they came within full sight of the palace which proved to be very large and lofty with a great number of airy pinnacles upon its roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though it was midday and the sun shone brightly over the marble front yet its snowy whiteness and its fantastic style of architecture made it look unreal like the frost work on a window pane or like the shapes of castles which one sees among the clouds by moonlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but just then a puff of wind brought down the smoke of the kitchen chimney among them and caused each man to smell the odor of the dish that he liked best and after scenting it they thought everything else moonshine and nothing real save this palace and save the banquet that was evidently ready to be served up in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they hastened their steps towards the portal but had not got half way across the wide lawn when a pack of lions tigers and wolves came bounding to meet them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the terrified mariners started back expecting no better fate than to be torn to pieces and devoured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to their surprise and joy however these wild beasts merely capered around them wagging their tails offering their heads to be stroked and patted and behaving just like so many wellbred house dogs when they wish to express their delight at meeting their master or their masters friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the biggest lion licked the feet of eurylochus and every other lion and every wolf and tiger singled out one of his two and twenty followers whom the beast fondled as if he loved him better than a beef bone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for all that eurylochus imagined that he saw something fierce and savage in their eyes nor would he have been surprised at any moment to feel the big lions terrible claws or to see each of the tigers make a deadly spring or each wolf leap at the throat of the man whom he had fondled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their mildness seemed unreal and a mere freak but their savage nature was as true as their teeth and claws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless the men went safely across the lawn with the wild beasts frisking about them and doing no manner of harm although as they mounted the steps of the palace you might possibly have heard a low growl particularly from the wolves as if they thought it a pity after all to let the strangers pass without so much as tasting what they were made of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eurylochus and his followers now passed under a lofty portal and looked through the open doorway into the interior of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing that they saw was a spacious hall and a fountain in the middle of it gushing up towards the ceiling out of a marble basin and falling back into it with a continual plash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water of this fountain as it spouted upward was constantly taking new shapes not very distinctly but plainly enough for a nimble fancy to recognize what they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it was the shape of a man in a long robe the fleecy whiteness of which was made out of the fountains spray now it was a lion or a tiger or a wolf or an ass or as often as anything else a hog wallowing in the marble basin as if it were his sty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was either magic or some very curious machinery that caused the gushing waterspout to assume all these forms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before the strangers had time to look closely at this wonderful sight their attention was drawn off by a very sweet and agreeable sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a womans voice was singing melodiously in another room of the palace and with her voice was mingled the noise of a loom at which she was probably seated weaving a rich texture of cloth and intertwining the high and low sweetness of her voice into a rich tissue of harmony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by the song came to an end and then all at once there were several feminine voices talking airily and cheerfully with now and then a merry burst of laughter such as you may always hear when three or four young women sit at work together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a sweet song that was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too sweet indeed answered eurylochus shaking his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet it was not so sweet as the song of the sirens those birdlike damsels who wanted to tempt us on the rocks so that our vessel might be wrecked and our bones left whitening along the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but just listen to the pleasant voices of those maidens and that buzz of the loom as the shuttle passes to and fro said another comrade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a domestic household homelike sound it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah before that weary siege of troy i used to hear the buzzing loom and the womens voices under my own roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall i never hear them again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor taste those nice little savory dishes which my dearest wife knew how to serve up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall fare better here said another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how innocently those women are babbling together without guessing that we overhear them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mark that richest voice of all so pleasant and so familiar but which yet seems to have the authority of a mistress among them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us show ourselves at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what harm can the lady of the palace and her maidens do to mariners and warriors like us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember said eurylochus that it was a young maiden who beguiled three of our friends into the palace of the king of the laestrygons who ate up one of them in the twinkling of an eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no warning or persuasion however had any effect on his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went up to a pair of folding doors at the farther end of the hall and throwing them wide open passed into the next room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eurylochus meanwhile had stepped behind a pillar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the short moment while the folding doors opened and closed again he caught a glimpse of a very beautiful woman rising from the loom and coming to meet the poor weatherbeaten wanderers with a hospitable smile and her hand stretched out in welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were four other young women who joined their hands and danced merrily forward making gestures of obeisance to the strangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were only less beautiful than the lady who seemed to be their mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet eurylochus fancied that one of them had seagreen hair and that the closefitting bodice of a second looked like the bark of a tree and that both the others had something odd in their aspect although he could not quite determine what it was in the little while that he had to examine them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the folding doors swung quickly back and left him standing behind the pillar in the solitude of the outer hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there eurylochus waited until he was quite weary and listened eagerly to every sound but without hearing anything that could help him to guess what had become of his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> footsteps it is true seemed to be passing and repassing in other parts of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was a clatter of silver dishes or golden ones which made him imagine a rich feast in a splendid banqueting hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but by and by he heard a tremendous grunting and squealing and then a sudden scampering like that of small hard hoofs over a marble floor while the voices of the mistress and her four handmaidens were screaming all together in tones of anger and derision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eurylochus could not conceive what had happened unless a drove of swine had broken into the palace attracted by the smell of the feast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chancing to cast his eyes at the fountain he saw that it did not shift its shape as formerly nor looked either like a longrobed man or a lion a tiger a wolf or an ass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looked like nothing but a hog which lay wallowing in the marble basin and filled it from brim to brim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we must leave the prudent eurylochus waiting in the outer hall and follow his friends into the inner secrecy of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as the beautiful woman saw them she arose from the loom as i have told you and came forward smiling and stretching out her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took the hand of the foremost among them and bade him and the whole party welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have been long expected my good friends said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i and my maidens are well acquainted with you although you do not appear to recognize us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at this piece of tapestry and judge if your faces must not have been familiar to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the voyagers examined the web of cloth which the beautiful woman had been weaving in her loom and to their vast astonishment they saw their own figures perfectly represented in different colored threads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a lifelike picture of their recent adventures showing them in the cave of polyphemus and how they had put out his one great moony eye while in another part of the tapestry they were untying the leathern bags puffed out with contrary winds and farther on they beheld themselves scampering away from the gigantic king of the laestrygons who had caught one of them by the leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lastly there they were sitting on the desolate shore of this very island hungry and downcast and looking ruefully at the bare bones of the stag which they devoured yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was as far as the work had yet proceeded but when the beautiful woman should again sit down at her loom she would probably make a picture of what had since happened to the strangers and of what was now going to happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see she said that i know all about your troubles and you cannot doubt that i desire to make you happy for as long a time as you may remain with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this purpose my honored guests i have ordered a banquet to be prepared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fish fowl and flesh roasted and in luscious stews and seasoned i trust to all your tastes are ready to be served up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if your appetites tell you it is dinner time then come with me to the festal saloon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this kind invitation the hungry mariners were quite overjoyed and one of them taking upon himself to be spokesman assured their hospitable hostess that any hour of the day was dinner time with them whenever they could get flesh to put in the pot and fire to boil it with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the beautiful woman led the way and the four maidens one of them had seagreen hair another a bodice of oak bark a third sprinkled a shower of water drops from her fingers ends and the fourth had some other oddity which i have forgotten all these followed behind and hurried the guests along until they entered a magnificent saloon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was built in a perfect oval and lighted from a crystal dome above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around the walls were ranged two and twenty thrones overhung by canopies of crimson and gold and provided with the softest of cushions which were tasselled and fringed with gold cord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each of the strangers was invited to sit down and there they were two and twenty storm beaten mariners in worn and tattered garb sitting on two and twenty cushioned and canopied thrones so rich and gorgeous that the proudest monarch had nothing more splendid in his stateliest hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you might have seen the guests nodding winking with one eye and leaning from one throne to another to communicate their satisfaction in hoarse whispers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our good hostess has made kings of us all said one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill engage it will be fit to set before two and twenty kings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope said another it will be mainly good substantial joints sirloins spareribs and hinder quarters without too many kickshaws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i thought the good lady would not take it amiss i should call for a fat slice of fried bacon to begin with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see how it was with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the loftiest seats of dignity on royal thrones they could think of nothing but their greedy appetite which was the portion of their nature that they shared with wolves and swine so that they resembled those vilest of animals far more than they did kingsif indeed kings were what they ought to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the beautiful woman now clapped her hands and immediately there entered a train of two and twenty serving man bringing dishes of the richest food all hot from the kitchen fire and sending up such a steam that it hung like a cloud below the crystal dome of the saloon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an equal number of attendants brought great flagons of wine of various kinds some of which sparkled as it was poured out and went bubbling down the throat while of other sorts the purple liquor was so clear that you could see the wrought figures at the bottom of the goblet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the servants supplied the two and twenty guests with food and drink the hostess and her four maidens went from one throne to another exhorting them to eat their fill and to quaff wine abundantly and thus to recompense them selves at this one banquet for the many days when they had gone without a dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but whenever the mariners were not looking at them which was pretty often as they looked chiefly into the basins and platters the beautiful woman and her damsels turned aside and laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the servants as they knelt down to present the dishes might be seen to grin and sneer while the guests were helping themselves to the offered dainties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and once in a while the strangers seemed to taste something that they did not like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is an odd kind of spice in this dish said one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant say it quite suits my palate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> send a good draught of wine down your throat said his comrade on the next throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the stuff to make this sort of cookery relish well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though i must needs say the wine has a queer taste too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the more i drink of it the better i like the flavor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever little fault they might find with the dishes they sat at dinner a prodigiously long while and it would really have made you ashamed to see how they swilled down the liquor and gobbled up the food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sat on golden thrones to be sure but they behaved like pigs in a sty and if they had had their wits about them they might have guessed that this was the opinion of their beautiful hostess and her maidens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it brings a blush into my face to reckon up in my own mind what mountains of meat and pudding and what gallons of wine these two and twenty guzzlers and gormandizers ate and drank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they forgot all about their homes and their wives and children and all about ulysses and everything else except this banquet at which they wanted to keep feasting forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at length they began to give over from mere incapacity to hold any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that last bit of fat is too much for me said one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i have not room for another morsel said his next neighbor heaving a sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my appetite is as sharp as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short they all left off eating and leaned back on their thrones with such a stupid and helpless aspect as made them ridiculous to behold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when their hostess saw this she laughed aloud so did her four damsels so did the two and twenty serving men that bore the dishes and their two and twenty fellows that poured out the wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the louder they all laughed the more stupid and helpless did the two and twenty gormandizers look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the beautiful woman took her stand in the middle of the saloon and stretching out a slender rod it had been all the while in her hand although they never noticed it till this moment she turned it from one guest to another until each had felt it pointed at himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beautiful as her face was and though there was a smile on it it looked just as wicked and mischievous as the ugliest serpent that ever was seen and fatwitted as the voyagers had made themselves they began to suspect that they had fallen into the power of an evilminded enchantress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wretches cried she you have abused a ladys hospitality and in this princely saloon your behavior has been suited to a hogpen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are already swine in everything but the human form which you disgrace and which i myself should be ashamed to keep a moment longer were you to share it with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it will require only the slightest exercise of magic to make the exterior conform to the hoggish disposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> assume your proper shapes gormandizers and begone to the sty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> uttering these last words she waved her wand and stamping her foot imperiously each of the guests was struck aghast at beholding instead of his comrades in human shape one and twenty hogs sitting on the same number of golden thrones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each man as he still supposed himself to be essayed to give a cry of surprise but found that he could merely grunt and that in a word he was just such another beast as his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looked so intolerably absurd to see hogs on cushioned thrones that they made haste to wallow down upon all fours like other swine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they tried to groan and beg for mercy but forthwith emitted the most awful grunting and squealing that ever came out of swinish throats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would have wrung their hands in despair but attempting to do so grew all the more desperate for seeing themselves squatted on their hams and pawing the air with their fore trotters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what little red eyes half buried in fat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what long snouts instead of grecian noses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but brutes as they certainly were they yet had enough of human nature in them to be shocked at their own hideousness and still intending to groan they uttered a viler grunt and squeal than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so harsh and earpiercing it was that you would have fancied a butcher was sticking his knife into each of their throats or at the very least that somebody was pulling every hog by his funny little twist of a tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the enchantress giving them some smart strokes with her wand and then she turned to the serving mendrive out these swine and throw down some acorns for them to eat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door of the saloon being flung open the drove of hogs ran in all directions save the right one in accordance with their hoggish perversity but were finally driven into the back yard of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a sight to bring tears into ones eyes and i hope none of you will be cruel enough to laugh at it to see the poor creatures go snuffing along picking up here a cabbage leaf and there a turnip top and rooting their noses in the earth for whatever they could find <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in their sty moreover they behaved more piggishly than the pigs that had been born so for they bit and snorted at one another put their feet in the trough and gobbled up their victuals in a ridiculous hurry and when there was nothing more to be had they made a great pile of themselves among some unclean straw and fell fast asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they had any human reason left it was just enough to keep them wondering when they should be slaughtered and what quality of bacon they should make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime as i told you before eurylochus had waited and waited and waited in the entrance hall of the palace without being able to comprehend what had befallen his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last when the swinish uproar resounded through the palace and when he saw the image of a hog in the marble basin he thought it best to hasten back to the vessel and inform the wise ulysses of these marvelous occurrences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he ran as fast as he could down the steps and never stopped to draw breath till he reached the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked king ulysses as soon as he saw him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where are your two and twenty comrades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at these questions eurylochus burst into tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried i greatly fear that we shall never see one of their faces again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he told ulysses all that had happened as far as he knew it and added that he suspected the beautiful woman to be a vile enchantress and the marble palace magnificent as it looked to be only a dismal cavern in reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for his companions he could not imagine what had become of them unless they had been given to the swine to be devoured alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this intelligence all the voyagers were greatly affrighted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ulysses lost no time in girding on his sword and hanging his bow and quiver over his shoulders and <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking a spear in his right hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his followers saw their wise leader making these preparations they inquired whither he was going and earnestly besought him not to leave them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are our king cried they and what is more you are the wisest man in the whole world and nothing but your wisdom and courage can get us out of this danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you desert us and go to the enchanted palace you will suffer the same fate as our poor companions and not a soul of us will ever see our dear ithaca again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i am your king answered ulysses and wiser than any of you it is therefore the more my duty to see what has befallen our comrades and whether anything can yet be done to rescue them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait for me here until tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i do not then return you must hoist sail and endeavor to find your way to our native land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my part i am answerable for the fate of these poor mariners who have stood by my side in battle and been so often drenched to the skin along with me by the same tempestuous surges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will either bring them back with me or perish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had his followers dared they would have detained him by force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but king ulysses frowned sternly on them and shook his spear and bade them stop him at their peril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing him so determined they let him go and sat down on the sand as disconsolate a set of people as could be waiting and praying for his return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened to ulysses just as before that when he had gone a few steps from the edge of the cliff the purple bird came fluttering towards him crying peep peep peweep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and using all the art it could to persuade him to go no farther <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are arrayed like a king in purple and gold and wear a golden crown upon your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it because i too am a king that you desire so earnestly to speak with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you can talk in human language say what you would have me do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answered the purple bird very dolorously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly there lay some heavy anguish at the little birds heart and it was a sorrowful predicament that he could not at least have the consolation of telling what it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ulysses had no time to waste in trying to get at the mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he therefore quickened his pace and had gone a good way along the pleasant wood path when there met him a young man of very brisk and intelligent aspect and clad in a rather singular garb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore a short cloak and a sort of cap that seemed to be furnished with a pair of wings and from the lightness of his step you would have supposed that there might likewise be wings on his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to enable him to walk still better for he was always on one journey or another he carried a winged staff around which two serpents were wriggling and twisting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short i have said enough to make you guess that it was quicksilver and ulysses who knew him of old and had learned a great deal of his wisdom from him recognized him in a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whither are you going in such a hurry wise ulysses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you not know that this island is enchanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wicked enchantress whose name is circe the sister of king aetes dwells in the marble palace which you see yonder among the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by her magic arts she changes every human being into the brute beast or fowl whom he happens most to resemble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that little bird which met me at the edge of the cliff exclaimed ulysses was he a human being once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was once a king named picus and a pretty good sort of a king too only rather too proud of his purple robe and his crown and the golden chain about his neck so he was forced to take the shape of a gaudyfeathered bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lions and wolves and tigers who will come running to meet you in front of the palace were formerly fierce and cruel men resembling in their disposition the wild beasts whose forms they now rightfully wear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and my poor companions said ulysses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have they undergone a similar change through the arts of this wicked circe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you well know what gormandizers they were replied quicksilver and rogue that he was he could not help laughing at the joke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you will not be surprised to hear that they have all taken the shapes of swine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if circe had never done anything worse i really should not think her so very much to blame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but can i do nothing to help them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will require all your wisdom said quicksilver and a little of my own into the bargain to keep your royal and sagacious self from being transformed into a fox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but do as i bid you and the matter may end better than it has begun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he was speaking quicksilver seemed to be in search of something he went stooping along the ground and soon laid his hand on a little plant with a snowwhite flower which he plucked and smelt of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ulysses had been looking at that very spot only just before and it appeared to him that the plant had burst into full flower the instant when quicksilver touched it with his fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take this flower king ulysses said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guard it as you do your eyesight for i can assure you it is exceedingly rare and precious and you might seek the whole earth over without ever finding another like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep it in your hand and smell of it frequently after you enter the palace and while you are talking with the enchantress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> especially when she offers you food or a draught of wine out of her goblet be careful to fill your nostrils with the flowers fragrance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> follow these directions and you may defy her magic arts to change you into a fox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quicksilver then gave him some further advice how to behave and bidding him be bold and prudent again assured him that powerful as circe was he would have a fair prospect of coming safely out of her enchanted palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after listening attentively ulysses thanked his good friend and resumed his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had taken only a few steps when recollecting some other questions which he wished to ask he turned round again and beheld nobody on the spot where quicksilver had stood for that winged cap of his and those winged shoes with the help of the winged staff had carried him quickly out of sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when ulysses reached the lawn in front of the palace the lions and other savage animals came bounding to meet him and would have fawned upon him and licked his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the wise king struck at them with his long spear and sternly bade them begone out of his path for he knew that they had once been bloodthirsty men and would now tear him limb from limb instead of fawning upon him could they do the mischief that was in their hearts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wild beasts yelped and glared at him and stood at a distance while he ascended the palace steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on entering the hall ulysses saw the magic fountain in the center of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the upgushing water had now again taken the shape of a man in a long white fleecy robe who appeared to be making gestures of welcome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king likewise heard the noise of the shuttle in the loom and the sweet melody of the beautiful womans song and then the pleasant voices of herself and the four maidens talking together with peals of merry laughter intermixed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ulysses did not waste much time in listening to the laughter or the song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaned his spear against one of the pillars of the hall and then after loosening his sword in the scabbard stepped boldly forward and threw the folding doors wide open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment she beheld his stately figure standing in the doorway the beautiful woman rose from the loom and ran to meet him with a glad smile throwing its sunshine over her face and both her hands extended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the nymph with the seagreen hair made a courtesy down to the ground and likewise bade him welcome so did her sister with the bodice of oaken bark and she that sprinkled dewdrops from her fingers ends and the fourth one with some oddity which i cannot remember <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and circe as the beautiful enchantress was called who had deluded so many persons that she did not doubt of being able to delude ulysses not your companions said she have already been received into my palace and have enjoyed the hospitable treatment to which the propriety of their behavior so well entitles them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if such be your pleasure you shall first take some refreshment and then join them in the elegant apartment which they now occupy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see i and my maidens have been weaving their figures into this piece of tapestry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she pointed to the web of beautifullywoven cloth in the loom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> circe and the four nymphs must have been very diligently at work since the arrival of the mariners for a great many yards of tapestry had nw been wrought in addition to what i before described <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this new part ulysses saw his two and twenty friends represented as sitting on cushions and canopied thrones greedily devouring dainties and quaffing deep draughts of wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the work had not yet gone any further <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the enchantress was far too cunning to let ulysses see the mischief which her magic arts had since brought upon the gormandizers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for yourself valiant sir said circe judging by the dignity of your aspect i take you to be nothing less than a king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deign to follow me and you shall be treated as befits your rank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so ulysses followed her into the oval saloon where his two and twenty comrades had devoured the banquet which ended so disastrously for themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but all this while he had held the snowwhite flower in his hand and had constantly smelt of it while circe was speaking and as he crossed the threshold of the saloon he took good care to inhale several long and deep snuffs of its fragrance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of two and twenty thrones which had before been ranged around the wall there was now only a single throne in the center of the apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this was surely the most magnificent seat that ever a king or an emperor reposed himself upon all made of chased gold studded with precious stones with a cushion that looked like a soft heap of living roses and overhung by a canopy of sunlight which circe knew how to weave into drapery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the enchantress took ulysses by the hand and made him sit down upon this dazzling throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then clapping her hands she summoned the chief butler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bring hither said she the goblet that is set apart for kings to drink out of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and fill it with the same delicious wine which my royal brother king aetes praised so highly when he last visited me with my fair daughter medea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were she now here it would delight her to see me offering this wine to my honored guest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ulysses while the butler was gone for the wine held the snowwhite flower to his nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this the four maidens tittered whereupon the enchantress looked round at them with an aspect of severity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the wholesomest juice that ever was squeezed out of the grape said she for instead of disguising a man as other liquor is apt to do it brings him to his true self and shows him as he ought to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chief butler liked nothing better than to see people turned into swine or making any kind of a beast of themselves so he made haste to bring the royal goblet filled with a liquid as bright as gold and which kept sparkling upward and throwing a sunny spray over the brim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but delightfully as the wine looked it was mingled with the most potent enchantments that circe knew how to concoct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think that all you scientific parties will take treasure if you can find it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are looking for traces of the old honduras civilization put in professor bumper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and doubtless you will find it was the somewhat too courteous answer of the guide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called to the indians in their tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must soon get under the nets or you will be eaten alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tents were set up smudge fires built and supper quickly prepared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dusk fell rapidly and as tom and ned walked a little way down toward the river before turning in under the sort of lonesome and gloomy isnt it tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you didnt expect to find a moving picture show in the wilds of honduras did you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly cried ned as a great soft black shadow seemed to sweep out of a clump of trees toward him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> involuntarily he clutched toms arm and pointed his face showing fear in the fastgathering darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was characteristic of him that though by nature he was prompt in action he never acted so hurriedly as to obscure his judgment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so though now ned showed a trace of strange excitement tom was cool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what did you think you saw ned another alligator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw a black shadow and i didnt think i saw it either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since when were you afraid of shadows ned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not afraid of ordinary shadows answered ned and in his voice there was an uncertain tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not afraid of my shadow or yours tom or anybodys that i can see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this wasnt any human shadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as if a great big blob of wet darkness had been waved over your head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a queer explanation tom said in a low voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great big blob of wet darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that just describes it went on ned looking up and around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was just as if you were in some dark room and some one waved a wet velvet cloak over your headspooky like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it didnt make a sound but there was a smell as if a den of some wild beast was near here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember that odor from the time we went hunting with your electric rifle in the jungle and got near the den in the rocks where the tigers lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well there is a wild beast smell all around here admitted tom sniffing the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the alligators in the river i guess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know they have an odor of musk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to say you didnt feel that shadow flying over us just now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i felt something sail through the air but i took it to be a big bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to tell you the truth i was thinking about beecherwondering when he would get here added tom quickly as if to forestall any question as to whether or not his thoughts had to do with beecher in connection with toms affair of the heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it wasnt a birdat least not a regular bird said ned in a low voice as once more he looked at the dark and gloomy jungle that stretched back from the river and behind the little clearing where the camp had been made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried tom in what he tried to make a cheerful voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is getting on your nerves ned and i didnt know you had any <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets go back and turn in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im dogtired and the mosquitoes are beginning to find that were here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the black shadows wont get you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not at all unwilling to leave so gloomy a scene ned after a brief glance up and down the dark river followed his chum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they found professor bumper and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon in their tent a separate one having been set up for the two men adjoining that of the youths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon as he caught sight of tom and ned in the flickering light of the smudge fire between the two canvas shelters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were just wondering what had become of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you look cozy enough in there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did indeed look cheerful in contrast to the damp and dark jungle all about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper being an experienced traveler knew how to provide for such comforts as were possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> folding cots had been opened for himself mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon and the guide to sleep on others similar being set up in the tent where tom and ned were to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle of the tent the professor had made a table of his own and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damons suit cases and on this placed a small dry battery electric light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was making some notes doubtless for a future book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacinto was going about the camp seeing that the indians were at their duties though most of them had gone directly to sleep after supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> better get inside and under the nets advised professor bumper to tom and ned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mosquitoes here are the worst i ever saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were beginning to believe that returned ned who was unusually quiet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant stand it any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im itching in a dozen places now from their bites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as tom and ned had no wish for a light which would be sure to attract insects they entered their tent in the dark and were soon stretched out in comparative comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom was just on the edge of a deep sleep when he heard i cant understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say i cant understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was real and yet oh go to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> advised tom and turning over he was soon breathing heavily and regularly indicating that he at least had taken his own advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned too finally succumbed to the overpowering weariness of the first day of travel and he too slept though it was an uneasy slumber disturbed by a feeling as though some one were holding a heavy black quilt over his head preventing him from breathing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the feeling sensation or dreamwhatever it wasperhaps a nightmarebecame at last so real to ned that he struggled himself into wakefulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with an effort he sat up uttering an inarticulate cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his surprise he was what is the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked ned quickly trying to peer through the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is jacintoyour guide was the soft answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was walking about camp and hearing you murmuring i came to your tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment ned did not answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened and could tell by the continued heavy and regular breathing of his chum that tom was still asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came in to see what was the matter with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no of course not said ned a bit shortly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ii had a bad dream that was all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> try to get all the sleep you can for we must start early to avoid the heat of the day and there was the sound of the guide leaving and arranging the folds of the mosquito net behind him to keep out the night flying insects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more ned composed himself to sleep and this time successfully for he did not have any more unpleasant dreams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the quiet of the jungle settled down over the camp at least the comparative quiet of the jungle for there were always noises of some sort going on from the fall of some rotten tree limb to the scream or growl of a wild beast while now and again from the river came the piglike grunts of the alligators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was about two oclock in the morning as they ascertained later when the whole camp white travelers and allwas suddenly awakened by a wild scream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to come from one of the natives who called out a certain word ever and over again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to tom and ned it oshtoo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> came the answering voice of jacinto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the indians has been attacked by a big vampire bat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be a raid by the dangerous creatures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> notwithstanding this warning ned stuck his head out of the tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same instant he was aware of a dark enfolding shadow passing over him and with a shudder of fear he jumped back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried tom springing from his cot and hastening to the side of his chum in the tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know but jacinto is yelling something about vampires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hes warning us to be careful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stuck my head out just now and i felt that same sort of shadow i felt this evening when we were down near the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that instant tom flashed a pocket electric lamp he had taken from beneath his pillow and in the gleam of it he and ned saw fluttering about the tent some dark shadowlike form at there it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he held up his hands instinctively to shield his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yelled tom unconsciously adding to the din that seemed to pervade every part of the camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a monster bat and here goes for a strike at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he caught up his camera tripod which was near his cot and made a swing with it at the creature that had flown into the tent through an opening it had made for itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if its a vampire itll it wont do anything to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shouted tom as he struck the creature knocking it into the corner of the tent with a thud that told it must be completely stunned if not killed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but whats it all about anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mingled with them were calls of jacinto partly in spanish partly in the indian tongue and partly in english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a raid by vampire bats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was all tom and ned could distinguish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall have to light fires to keep them away if we can suc ceed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every one grab up a club and strike hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried tom getting on some clothes by the light of his gleaming electric light which he had set on his cot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre not going out there are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if theres a fight i want to be in it bats or anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here you have a light like mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flash it on and hang it somewhere on yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then get a club and come on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lights will blind the bats and we can see to hit em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toms plan seemed to be a good one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his lamp and neds had small hooks on them so they could be carried in the upper coat pocket showing a gleam of light and leaving the hands free for use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of the tents rushed the young men to find professor bumper and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two men had clubs and were striking about in the half darkness for now the indians had set several fires aglow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the gleams constantly growing brighter as more fuel was piled on the young inventor and his chum saw a weird sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> circling and wheeling about in the camp clearing were many of the black shadowy forms that had caused ned such alarm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great bats they were and a dangerous species if jacinto was to be believed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the uncanny creatures flew in and out among the trees and tents now swooping low near the indians or the travelers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at such times clubs would be used often with the effect of killing or stunning the flying pests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time it seemed as if the bats would fairly overwhelm the camp so many of them were there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the increasing lights and the attacks made by the indians and the white travelers turned the tide of battle and with silent flappings of their soft velvety wings the bats flew back to the jungle whence they had emerged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed jacinto with a sigh of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think they will come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon if those beasts or birdswhatever they are come back ill go and hide in the river and take my chances with the alligators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the alligators arent much worse asserted jacinto with a visible shiver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these vampire bats sometimes depopulate a whole village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont mean to say that the creatures can eat up a whole village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though they might if they got the chance was the answer of the spanish guide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these vampire bats fly from place to place in great swarms and they are so large and bloodthirsty that a few of them can kill a horse or an ox in a short time by sucking its blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so when the villagers find they are visited by a colony of these vampires they get out taking their live stock with them and stay in caves or in densely wooded places until the bats fly on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only a small colony that visited us to night or we would have had more trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think this lot will come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have killed too many of them and he looked about on the ground where many of the uncanny creatures were still twitching in the death struggle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive had enough of bats and mosquitoes he added as he slapped at his face and neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed the party of whites were set upon by the night insects to such an extent that it was necessary to hurry back to the protection of the nets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom and ned kicked outside the bat the former had killed in their tent and then both went back to their cots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was some little time before they fell asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they did not have much time to rest for an early start must be made to avoid the terrible heat of the middle of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whistled ned as he and tom arose in the gray dawn of the morning when jacinto announced the breakfast which the indian cook had prepared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if this is a sample of the wilds of honduras give me the tameness of shopton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh weve gone through with worse than this laughed tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all in the days work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess were a bit soft ned though we had hard enough work in that tunneldigging <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after breakfast while the indians were making ready the canoes professor bumper who in a previous visit to central america had become interested in the subject made a brief examination of some of the dead bats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were exceptionally large some almost as big as hawks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and were of the subfamily desmodidae the scientist said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a true bloodsucking bat went on the professor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this and he pointed to the noseleaves is the sucking apparatus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bat makes an opening in the skin with its sharp teeth and proceeds to extract the blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can well believe two or three of them attacking a steer or mule at once could soon weaken it so the animal would die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well a man has hands with which to use weapons but a helpless quadruped has not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though if a sufficient number of these bats attacked a man at the same time he would have small chance to escape alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their bites too may be poisonous for all i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the indians seemed glad to leave the place of the bats as they called the camp site <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacinto explained that the indians believed a vampire could kill them while they slept and they were very much afraid of the bloodsucking bats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were many other species in the tropics professor bumper explained most of which lived on fruit or on insects they caught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bloodsucking bats were comparatively few and the migratory sort fewer still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well were on our way once more remarked tom as again they were in the canoes being paddled up the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much longer does your water trip take professor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hardly know and professor bumper looked to jacinto to answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we go two more days in the canoes the guide answered and then we shall find the mules waiting for us at a place called hidjio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from then on we travel by land untilwell until you get to the place where you are going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you know where it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added nodding toward the professor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am leaving that part to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i have a map showing where i want to begin some excavations was the answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must first go to copan and see what arrangements we can make for laborers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after thatwell we shall trust to luck for what we shall find <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are said to be many curious things went on jacinto speaking as though he had no interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you thought what may be in themgreat heathen temples idols perhaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment none of the professors companions spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as though jacinto had tried to get some information <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally the oh yes we may find an idol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understand the ancient people who were here long before the spaniards came worshiped idols <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we shall take whatever antiquities we find <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grunted jacinto and then he called to the paddlers to increase their strokes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the journey up the river was not very eventful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many alligators were seen and tom and ned shot several with the electric rifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toward the close of the third days travel there was a cry from one of the rear boats and an alarm of a man having fallen overboard was given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom turned in time to see the poor fellows struggles and at the same time there was a swirl in the water and a black object shot forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom took quick aim and pulled the trigger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the explosive electric bullet went true to its mark and the great animal turned over in a death struggle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the river was filled with them and no sooner had the one nearest the unfortunate indian been disposed of than another made a dash for the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a wild scream of agony and then a dark arm shot up above the red foam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the waters seethed and bubbled as the alligators fought under it for possession of the paddler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom fired bullet after bullet from his wonderful rifle into the spot but though he killed some of the alligators this did not save the mans life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his body was not seen again though search was made for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the accident cast a little damper over the party and there was a feeling of gloom among the indians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper announced that he would see to it that the mans family did not want and this seemed to give general satisfaction especially to a brother who was with the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aside from being caught in a drenching storm and one or two minor accidents nothing else of moment marked the remainder of the river journey and at the end of the third day the canoes pulled to shore and a night camp was made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but where are the mules we are to use in traveling tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall march there in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no use to go there at night when all is dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the indians made camp as usual the goods being brought from the canoes and piled up near the tents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried tom awakening the next morning to find the sun streaming into his tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were to start before old sol got in his heavy work but we havent had breakfast yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt hear any one call us remarked ned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wonder if were the only lazy birds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked from the tent in time to see mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the canoes were not on the river bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not an indian in sight and no evidence of jacinto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have the others gone on ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rather think theyve gone back was the professors dry comment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the indians seem to have deserted us at the ending of this stage of our journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what has becomes of our friend jacinto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid he was rather a false friend was the professors answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the note he left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has gone and taken the canoes and all the indians with him and he held out a paper on which was some scribbled writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked tom seeing that the note was written in spanish a tongue which he could speak slightly but read indifferently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is some of beechers work was professor bumpers grim comment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems that jacinto was in his pay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean that beecher deliberately hired jacinto to betray us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here ill translate senors i greatly regret the step i have to take but i am a gentleman and having given my word i must keep it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no harm shall come to you i swear it on my honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> queer idea of honor he has <end> <end> 
<start> <start> know then that before i engaged myself to you i had been engaged by professor beecher through a friend to guide him into the copan valley where he wants to make some explorations for what i know not save maybe that it is for gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i agreed in case any rival expeditions came to lead them astray if i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so knowing from what you said that you were going to this place i engaged myself to you planning to do what i have done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i greatly regret it as i have come to like you but i had given my promise to professor beechers friend that i would first lead him to the copan valley and would keep others away until he had had a chance to do his exploration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i have led you to this wilderness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is far from the copan but you are near an indian village and you will be able to get help in a week or so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meanwhile you will not starve as you have plenty of supplies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will travel northeast you will come again to puerto cortes in due season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the money i had from you i deposit it to your credit professor beecher having made me an allowance for steering rival parties on the wrong trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i lose nothing and i save my honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i write this note as i am leaving in the night with the indians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put some harmless sedative in your tea that you might sleep soundly and not awaken until we were well on our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not try to follow us as the river will carry us swiftly away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and let me add there is no personal animosity on the part of professor beecher against you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have done to any rival expedition the same as i have done with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment there was silence and then tom well of all the mean contemptible tricks of a human skunk this is the limit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless my hairbrush but he is a scoundrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id like to start after him the biggest alligator in the river was neds comment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper said nothing for several seconds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a strange look on his face and then he laughed shortly as though the humor of the situation appealed to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor beecher has more gumption than i gave him credit for he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant exactly agree that it was the right thing to do but he or some friend acting for him seems to have taken precautions that we are not to suffer or lose money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beecher goes on the theory that all is fair in love and war i suppose and he may call this a sort of scientific war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned wondered as he looked at his chum how much love there was in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clearly beecher was determined to get that idol of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it cant be helped and we must make the best of it said tom after a pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now boys lets have breakfast and then well make what goods we cant take with us as snug as possible until we can send the mule drivers after them went on professor bumper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> send the mule drivers after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you mean to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont suppose im going to let a little thing like this stand between me and the discovery of kurzon and the idol of gold do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon i dont see how oh well find a way interrupted tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt the first time ive been pretty well stranded on an expedition of this kind and sometimes from the same causethe actions of a rival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now well turn the tables on the other fellows and see how they like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the professors right lets have breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacinto seems to have told the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom and ned got the meal and then a consultation was held as to what was best to be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant go on any further by water thats sure said tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place the river is too shallow and secondly we have no canoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the only thing is to go on foot through the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how can we and carry all this stuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well leave it here where it will be safe enough and tramp on to the nearest indian village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there well hire bearers to take our stuff on until we can get mules <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not going to turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but thats what i saykeep on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well never turn back agreed tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how can we manage it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when you have to do a thing its a whole lot easier to do than if you just feel as though you ought to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well pack up what we can carry and leave the rest added the scientist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being an experienced traveler professor bumper had arranged his baggage so that it could be carried by porters if necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything could be put into small packages including the tents and food supply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are four of us remarked tom and if we can not pack enough along with us to enable us to get to the nearest village we had better go back to civilization <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baggage stores and supplies that were to be left behind were made as snug as possible and so piled up that wild beasts could do the least harm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a pack was made up for each one to carry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would take weapons of course tom swifts electric rifle being the one he choose for himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they expected to be able to shoot game on their way and this would provide them food in addition to the concentrated supply they carried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> small tents in sections were carried there being two one for tom and ned and one for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as far as could be learned from a casual inspection jacinto and his deserting indians had taken back with them only a small quantity of food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were traveling light and down stream and could reach the town much more quickly than they had come away from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that beecher certainly was slick commented professor bumper when they were ready to start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must have known about what time i would arrive and he had jacinto waiting for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it was too good to be true to get an experienced guide like him so easily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was all planned and i was so engrossed in thinking of the ancient treasures i hope to find that i never thought of a possible trick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he led the way into the jungle carrying his heavy pack as lightly as did tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper had a general idea in which direction lay a number of native villages and it was determined to head for them blazing a path through the wilderness so that the indians could follow it back to the goods left behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was with rather heavy hearts that the party set off but toms spirits could not long stay clouded and the scientist was so goodnatured about the affair and seemed so eager to do the utmost to render beechers trick void that the others fell into a lighter mood and went on more cheerfully though the way was rough and the packs heavy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stopped at noon under a bower they made of palms and spreading the nets over them got a little rest after a lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when the sun was less hot they started off again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had not gone more than an hour on the second stage of their tramp when tom who was in the lead following the direction laid out by the compass suddenly stopped and reached around for his electric rifle which he was carrying at his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know but its some big animal there in the bushes was toms lowvoiced answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rustling increased and a form could be seen indistinctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom aimed the deadly gun and stood ready to pull the trigger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned tho had a side view into the underbrush gave a sudden cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in spite of ned newtons cry toms finger pressed the switchtrigger of the electric rifle for previous experience had taught him that it was sometimes the best thing to awe the natives in outoftheway corners of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the young inventor quickly elevated the muzzle and the deadly missile went hissing through the air over the head of a native indian who at that moment stepped from the bush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man startled and alarmed shrank back and was about to run into the jungle whence he had emerged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> small wonder if he had considering the reception he so unwittingly met with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aware of the necessity for making inquiries of one who knew that part of the jungle quickly called to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought at first you were a tapir or a tiger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say professor tom called back to the savant youd better speak to him in his lingo i cant manage it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may be useful in guiding us to that indian village jacinto told us of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this professor bumper did being able to make himself understood in the queer partspanish dialect used by the native hondurians though he could not of course speak it as fluently as had jacinto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper had made only a few remarks to the man who had so unexpectedly appeared out of the jungle when the scientist gave an exclamation of surprise at some of the answers made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does he refuse to help us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no it isnt that was the answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact he came here to help us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom this is the brother of the indian who fell overboard and who was eaten by the alligators <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he says you were very kind to try to save his brother with your rifle and for that reason he has come back to help us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes he went off with the rest of the indians when jacinto deserted us but he could not stand being a traitor after you had tried to save his brothers life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont show much emotion but they have deep feelings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this one says he will devote himself to your service from now on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe we can count on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is deeply grateful to you tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im glad of that for all our sakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what does he say about jacinto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the professor asked some more questions receiving answers and then translated them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this indian whose name is tolpec says jacinto is a fraud exclaimed professor bumper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made all the indians leave us in the night though many of them were willing to stay and fill the contract they had made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but jacinto would not let them making them desert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tolpec went away with the others but because of what tom had done he planned to come back at the first chance and be our guide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> accordingly he jumped ashore from one of the canoes and made his way to our camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got there found it deserted and followed us coming up just now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well im glad i didnt frighten him off with my gun remarked tom grimly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he agrees with us that jacinto is a scoundrel does he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess he might as well classify professor beecher in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not quite so sure of that said professor bumper slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can not believe beecher would play such a trick as this though some overzealous friend of his might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh of course beecher did it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard we were coming here figured out that wed start ahead of him and he wanted to side track us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well he did it all right and toms voice was bitter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has only sidetracked us for a while announced professor bumper in cheerful tones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean that this indian comes just in the nick of time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is well acquainted with this part of the jungle having lived here all his life and he offers to guide us to a place where we can get mules to transport ourselves and our baggage to copan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more the professor and the native conversed in the strange tongue and then professor he says it will be better for us to go back where we left our things and camp there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will stay with us tonight and in the morning go on to the nearest indian town and come back with porters and helpers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think that is good advice to follow put in tom for we do need our goods and if we reached the settlement ourselves we would have to send back for our things with the uncertainty of getting them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it was agreed that they would make a forced march back through the jungle to where they had been deserted by jacinto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they would make camp for the night and until such time as tolpec could return with a force of porters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not easy that backward tramp through the jungle especially as night had fallen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the new indian guide could see like a cat and led the party along paths they never could have found by themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the use of their pocket electric lights was a great help and possibly served to ward off the attacks of jungle beasts for as they tramped along they could hear stealthy sounds in the underbush on either side of the path as though tigers were stalking them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for there was in the woods an animal of the leopard family called tiger or tigre by the natives that was exceedingly fierce and dangerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but watchfulness prevented any accident and eventually the party reached the place where they had left their goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing had been disturbed and finally a fire was made the tents set up and a light meal with hot tea served <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well get ahead of beecher yet said tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you seem as anxious as professor bumper i guess i am admitted tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to see that idol of gold in the possession of our party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night passed without incident and then telling his new friends that he would return as soon as possible with help tolpec taking a small supply of food with him set out through the jungle again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the green vines and creepers closed after him and the explorers were left alone with their after all i wonder if it was wise to let him go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well maybe he only wanted to get us back here and then hell desert too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe thats what hes done now making us lose two or three days by inducing us to return waiting for what will never happenhis return with other natives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned do you really think tolpec is going to desert us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont know was the slowly given reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes it is broke in professor bumper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we might as well trust him and if he proves true as i believe he will well be so much better off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he proves a traitor well only have lost a few days for if he doesnt come back we can go on again in the way we started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont want to lose any time with that beecher chap on our trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not so very much concerned about him remarked professor bumper dryly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well because i think hell have just about as hard work locating the hidden city and finding the idol of gold as well have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in other words it will be an even thing unless he gets too far ahead of us or keeps us back and i dont believe he can do that now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i thought it best to take a chance with this indian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would hardly have taken the trouble to come all the way back and run the risks he did just to delay us a few days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile well take it easy and wait for the return of tolpec and his friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though none of them liked to admit it neds words had caused his three friends some anxiety and though they busied themselves about the camp there was an air of waiting impatiently for something to occur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and waiting is about the hardest work there is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was nothing for it but to wait and it might be at least a week professor bumper said before the indian could return with a party of porters and mules to move their baggage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes tolpec has not only to locate the settlement tom admitted but he must persuade the natives to come back with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may have trouble in that especially if it is known that he has left jacinto who i imagine is a power among the tribes here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there were only two things left to dowait and hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four days passed and there was no sign of tolpec <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eager ly and not a little anxiously they watched the jungle path along which he had disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exclaimed tom one morning when the day seemed a bit cooler than its predecessor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets go for a hunt or something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im tired of sitting around camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets all go for a trip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and perhaps i can get some specimens of interest added professor bumper who in addition to being an archaeologist was something of a naturalist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> accordingly having made everything snug in camp the party tom and ned equipped with electric rifles and the professor with a butterfly net and specimen boxes set forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon said he would carry a stout club as his weapon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jungle as usual was teeming with life but as ned and tom did not wish to kill wantonly they refrained from shooting until later in the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for once it was dead game did not keep well in that hot climate and needed to be cooked almost immediately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well try some shots on our back trip said the young inventor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper found plenty of his own particular kind of game which he caught in the net transferring the specimens to the boxes he carried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were beautiful butterflies moths and strange bugs in the securing of which the scientist evinced great delight though when one beetle nipped him firmly and painfully on his thumb his involuntary cry of pain was as real as that of any other person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i didnt let him get away he said in triumph when he had dropped the clawing insect into the cyanide bottle where death came painlessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is well worth a sore thumb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wandered on through the jungle taking care not to get too far from their camp for they did not want to lose their way nor did they want to be absent too long in case tolpec and his native friends should return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its about time we shot something i think remarked ned when they had been out about two hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets try for some of these wild turkeys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ought to go well roasted even if it isnt thanksgiving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets see who has the best luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tone down the charge in your rifle and use a smaller projectile or youll have nothing but a bunch of feathers to show for your shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the guns are loaded for deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the change was made and once more the two young men started off a little ahead of professor bumper and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom and ned had not gone far however before they heard a strange cry from mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shouted the eccentric man heres a monster after me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ejaculated tom as he began once more to change the charge in his rifle to a larger one running back meanwhile in the direction of the sound of the voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were really no tigers in honduras the jaguar being called a tiger by the natives while the cougar is called a lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the presence of these animals often dangerous to man had been indicated around camp and it was possible that one had been bold enough to attack mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon not through hunger but because of being cornered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes in some sort of trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when a moment later the young inventor burst through a fringe of bushes and saw mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon standing in a little clearing with upraised club tom could not repress a laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless my insurance policy but its a terrible beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it was at first glance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it was a giant iguana one of the most repulsivelooking of the lizards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not unlike an alligator in shape with spikes on its head and tail with a warty squatty ridgeencrusted body a big pouch beneath its chin and longtoed claws it was enough to strike terror into the heart of almost any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the smaller ones look dangerous and this one which was about five feet long looked capable of attacking a man and injuring him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a matter of fact the iguanas are harmless their shape and coloring being designed to protect them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not so positive of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just take your club and poke it out of the way the young inventor advised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its only waiting to be shoved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless my looking glass but i dont want to go near it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if my wife could see me now shed say it served me just right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon was not a coward but the giant iguana was not pleasant to look at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom with the butt of his rifle gave it a gentle shove whereupon the creature scurried off through the brush as though glad to make its escape unscathed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it was a new kind of alligator said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon with a sigh of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked professor bumper coming up at this juncture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never want to see one again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was worse than a vampire bat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> notwithstanding this when he heard that it was one of the largest sized iguanas ever seen the professor started through the jungle after it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant take it with us if we get it tom called after his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we might take the skin answered the professor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a standing order for such things from one of the museums i represent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can have a change of diet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wed better follow him said tom to ned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well have to let the turkeys go for a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> off they started through the jungle trailing after the impetuous professor who was intent on capturing the iguana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the giant lizards progress could be traced by the disturbance of the leaves and underbrush and the professor was following as closely as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so fast did he go that ned tom and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon following lost sight of him several wait a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well all be lost if you keep this up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill have him in another minute answered the professor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can almost reach him now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his voice ended in a scream that seemed to be one of terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so sudden was the change that tom and ned who were together ahead of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon looked at one another in fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that instant again came the voice of the savant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quickquick if you would save me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can the giant iguana tom swift did not stop to answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with his electric rifle in readiness he leaped forward through the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before tom and ned reached the place whence professor bumper had called they heard strange noises other than the imploring voice of their friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed as though some great body was threshing about in the jungle lashing the trees bushes and leaves about and when the two young men followed by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon reached the scene they saw that in a measure this really accounted for what they heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something like a great whip was beating about close to two trees that grew near together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then when the storm of twigs leaves and dirt caused by the leaping threshing thing ceased for a moment the onlookers saw something that filled them with terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between the two trees and seemingly bound to them by a great coiled rope spotted and banded was the body of professor bumper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his arms were pinioned to his sides and there was horror and terror on his face that looked imploringly at the youths from above the topmost coil of those encircling him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon as he ran pantingly up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has him in its coils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is wound around the trees too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that alone prevents it from crushing the professor to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned be ready with your rifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put in the heaviest charge and watch your chance to fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great ugly head of the boa reared itself up from the coils which it had with the quickness of thought thrown about the man between the two trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this species of snake is not poisonous and kills its prey by crushing it to death making it into a pulpy mass with scarcely a bone left unbroken after which it swallows its meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crushing power of one of these boas some of which reach a length of thirty feet with a body as large around as that of a fullgrown man is enormous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had seen his chance and he took it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the faint reportthe crack of the electric rifle and the folds of the serpent seemed to relax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see a good chance now added ned who had taken the small charge from his weapon replacing it with a heavier one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his rifle was also discharged in the direction of the snake and tom saw that the hit was a good one right through the ugly head of the reptile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one other will be enough to make him loosen his coils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried tom as he fired again and such was the killing power of the electric bullets that the snake though an immense one and one that short of decapitation could have received many injuries without losing power seemed to shrivel up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its folds relaxed and the coils of the great body fell in a heap at the roots of the two trees between which the scientist had been standing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper seemed to fall backward as the grip of the serpent relaxed but tom dropping his rifle and calling to ned to keep an eye on the snake leaped forward and caught his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked tom carrying the limp form over to a grassy place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no answer the savants eyes were closed and he breathed but faintly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned newton fired two more electric bullets into the still writhing body of the boa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i guess hes all in he called to tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so our friend seems to be commented mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you anything with which to revive him tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see if you can find a little water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have some in my flask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom mixed a dose of the spirits which he carried with him and this forced between the pallid lips of the scientist revived him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked faintly as he opened his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes i remember he added slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boa dont try to talk urged tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the snake is dead or dying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor bumper appeared to be considering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he moved first one limb then another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to have the power over all his muscles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see how it happened he said as he sat up after taking a little more of the ammonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was following the iguana and when the big lizard came to a stop in a little hollow place in the ground at the foot of those two trees i leaned over to slip a noose of rope about its neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i felt myself caught as if in the hands of a giant and bound fast between the two trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the speechless aunt i gathered didnt approvehaving doubts of my religiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever we were estranged we could keep apart for days and to begin with every such separation was a relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i would want her a restless longing would come upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would think of the flow of her arms of the soft gracious bend of her body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would lie awake or dream of a transfigured marion of light and fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was indeed dame nature driving me on to womankind in her stupid inexorable way but i thought it was the need of marion that troubled me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i always went back to marion at last and made it up and more or less conceded or ignored whatever thing had parted us and more and more i urged her to marry me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the long run that became a fixed idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it entangled my will and my pride i told myself i was not going to be beaten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think as a matter of fact my real passion for marion had waned enormously long before we were married that she had lived it down by sheer irresponsiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i felt sure of my three hundred a year she stipulated for delay twelve months delay to see how things would turn out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were times when she seemed simply an antagonist holding out irritatingly against something i had to settle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover i began to be greatly distracted by the interest and excitement of tonobungays success by the change and movement in things the going to and fro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would forget her for days together and then desire her with an irritating intensity at last one saturday afternoon after a brooding morning i determined almost savagely that these delays must end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went off to the little home at walham green and made marion come with me to putney common <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marion wasnt at home when i got there and i had to fret for a time and talk to her father who was just back from his office he explained and enjoying himself in his own way in the greenhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to ask your daughter to marry me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i dont approve of long engagements either said her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but marion will have her own way about it anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seen this i went in to talk to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shell want time to get her things said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i and marion sat down together on a little seat under some trees at the top of putney hill and i came to my point abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here marion i said are you going to marry me or are she smiled at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well she said were engagedarent we <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked me in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you promised to marry me when i had three hundred a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was silent for a space <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant we go on for a time as we are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could marry on three hundred a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it means a very little house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they manage on two hundred and fifty but thats very little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she says they have a semidetached house almost on the road and hardly a bit of garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the wall to nextdoor is so thin they hear everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and people stand against the railings and talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre doing so an extraordinary bitterness possessed me at this invasion of the stupendous beautiful business of love by sordid necessity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i answered her with immense restraint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i said we could have a doublefronted detached houseat ealing saywith a square patch of lawn in front and a garden behindandand a tiled bathroom which means five hundred a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes well you see i told i burst into laughter that had more than a taste of bitterness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she said a little flushed but be sensible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you really mean youve got a rise all at once of two hundred a she scrutinised me a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve done this as a surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said and laughed at my laughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had become radiant and that made me radiant too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i said yes and laughed no longer bitterly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she clasped her hands and looked me in the eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was so pleased that i forgot absolutely my disgust of a moment before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forgot that she had raised her price two hundred pounds a year and that i had bought her at that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said standing up lets go towards the sunset dear and talk about it all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you knowthis is a most beautiful world an amazingly beautiful world and when the sunset falls upon you it makes you into shining gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into something better that either glass or gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for all that evening i wooed her and kept her glad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made me repeat my assurances over again and still doubted a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we furnished that doublefronted house from atticit ran to an atticto cellar and created a garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you shall have pampas grass i declared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there were moments as we went in imagination about that house together when my whole being cried out to take her in my armsnow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on that aspect of life i touched very lightly in that talk very lightly because i had had my lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she promised to marry me within two months time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shyly reluctantly she named a day and next afternoon in heat and wrath we broke it off again for the last time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i refused flatly to have a normal wedding with wedding cake in white favours carriages and the rest of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it dawned upon me suddenly in conversation with her and her mother that this was implied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i blurted out my objection forthwith and this time it wasnt any ordinary difference of opinion it was a row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont remember a quarter of the things we flung out in that dispute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember her mother reiterating in tones of gentle remonstrance but george dear you must have a caketo send home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we all reiterated things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seem to remember a refrain of my own a marriage is too sacred a thing too private a thing for this display <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her father came in and stood behind me against the wall and her aunt appeared beside the sideboard and stood with arms looking from speaker to speaker a sternly gratified prophetess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it didnt occur to me then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how painful it was to marion for these people to witness my rebellion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but george said her father what sort of marriage do you want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont want to go to one of those there registry thats exactly what id like to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marriage is too private a thing i shouldnt feel married said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here marion i said we are going to be married at a registry office <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe in all these fripperies and superstitions and i wont submit to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive agreed to all whats he agreed to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant marry at a registry office said marion sallowwhite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well i said standing up white and tense and it amazed she leant forward over the table staring blankly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but presently her halfaverted face began to haunt me as she had sat at the table and her arm and the long droop of her shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day i did an unexampled thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sent a telegram to my uncle bad temper not coming to business and set off for highgate and ewart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was actually at workon a bust of millie and seemed very glad for any interruption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ewart you old fool i said knock off and come for a days gossip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a sympathetic sort of lunacy about girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said ewart putting down a chisel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was all i told him of my affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got no money he remarked to clear up ambiguity in my invitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got a jar of shandygaff some food and on ewarts suggestion two japanese sunshades in staines we demanded extra cushions at the boathouse and we spent an enormously soothing day in discourse and meditation our boat moored in a shady place this side of windsor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seem to remember ewart with a cushion forward only his heels and sunshade and some black ends of hair showing a voice and no more against the shining smoothlystreaming mirror of the trees and bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not worth it was the burthen of the voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd better get yourself a millie ponderevo and then you wouldnt feel so upset <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i said decidedly thats not my way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a thread of smoke ascended from ewart for a while like smoke from an altar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everythings a muddle and you think it isnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody knows where we arebecause as a matter of fact we arent anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are women propertyor are they fellowcreatures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or a sort of proprietary goddesses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well hm said ewart in my pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my idea i said is to meet one person who will belong to meto whom i shall belongbody and soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must come to each theres no such thing as a pure person or an impure person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was so manifestly true that it silenced me altogether <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you belong to her and she to you ponderevowhich ends for a time we smoked in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did i tell you ponderevo of a wonderful discovery ive made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive just thought all that business out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rather lean and out of sorts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with bunchy black whiskers and a worried eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> been good so far and its fretting him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres grundy in a state of sexual panic for examplefor gods sake cover it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most dreadful things are happening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rushing aboutlong arms going like a windmill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> starts out for an absolute obliteration of everything absolute separations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one side of the road for men and the other for women and a hoardingwithout posters between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every boy and girl to be sewed up in a sack and sealed just the head and hands and feet out until twentyone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> music abolished calico garments for the lower animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sparrows to be i laughed abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grundy in one moodand it puts mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grundyshes a muchmaligned person ponderevoa rake at heartand it puts her in a most painful state of flustermost painful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when grundy tells her things are shocking shes shockedpink and breathless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she goes about trying to conceal her profound sense of guilt behind a haughty expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grundy meanwhile is in a state of complete whirlabout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long lean knuckly hands pointing and gesticulating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre still thinking of thingsthinking of things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they get it out of books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant imagine where they get it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody ought to whisper!theres something suggestive in the mere act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the museumthings too dreadful for words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why cant we have pure artwith the anatomy all wrong and pure and niceand pure fiction pure poetry instead of all this stuff with allusionsallusions? <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres something up behind that locked door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the interests of public moralityyes sir as a pure good mani insistill lookit wont hurt mei insist on looking my dutymmmthe keyhole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kicked his legs about extravagantly and i laughed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats grundy in one mood ponderevo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats one of the lies we tell about women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they take on just what men tell em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just exactly as its put to them then you get old grundy in another mood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mad with the idea of mysterious unknown wicked delicious things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any one who knows about these things knows theres just as much mystery and deliciousness about grundys forbidden things as there is about eating ham <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jolly nice if its a bright morning and youre well and hungry and having breakfast in the open air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jolly unattractive if youre off colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but grundys covered it all up and hidden it and put mucky shades and covers over it until hes forgotten it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> begins to fester round it in his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has dreadful struggleswith himself about impure thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you set grundy with hot earscurious in undertones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grundy on the loose grundy in a hoarse whisper and with furtive eyes and convulsive movementsmaking things indecent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sneaks round a corner and sins ugly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its grundy and his dark corners that make vice vice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then hes frantic with repentance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and wants to be cruel to fallen women and decent harmless sculptors of the simple mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grundy i suppose doesnt know he sins i remarked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but bless her heart shes a woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then again you get grundy with a large greasy smilelike an accident to a butter tuball over his face being liberal mindedgrundy in his antipuritan moments trying not to see harm in itgrundy the friend of innocent pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he makes you sick with the harm hes trying not to see in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thats why everythings wrong ponderevo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stands in the light and we young people cant see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we catch his gusts of panic his disease of nosing his greasiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont know what we may think what we may say he does his silly utmost to prevent our reading and seeing the one thing the one sort of discussion we findquite naturally and properlysupremely interesting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we dont adolescence we blunder up to sex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> daredare to lookand he may dirt you for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls are terrorstricken to silence by his significant whiskers by the bleary something in his suddenly ewart with an almost jackinthebox effect sat up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes about us everywhere ponderevo he said very solemnly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he regarded me for my opinion very earnestly with his pipe in the corner of his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre the remotest cousin he ever had i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here ewart i asked how would you have things different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wrinkled up his queer face regarded the wait and made his pipe gurgle for a space thinking deeply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve grown up under the terror of grundy and that innocent but docile andyesformidable lady his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how far the complications arent a disease a sort of bleaching under the grundy shadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is possible there are things i have still to learn about women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> man has eaten of the tree of knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant have your cake and eat it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were in for knowledge lets have it plain and straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should begin i think by abolishing the ideas of decency and grundy would have fits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grundy ponderevo would have cold douchespubliclyif the sight was not too painfulthree times a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont think mind you that i should let the sexes run about together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact behind the sexesis sex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it trails abouteven in the best mixed company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men get showing off and quarrellingand the women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose the ancestral males have competed for the ancestral females ever since they were both some sort of grubby little reptile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you arent going to alter that in a thousand years or so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never should you have a mixed company neverexcept with only one man or only one woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then his long hand went out in weird gestures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seem to seei seem to seea sort of city of women ponderevo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a walled enclosuregood stonemasons worka city wall high as the walls of rome going about a garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dozens of square miles of gardentreesfountains arbourslakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lawns on which the women play avenues in which they gossip boats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> women like that sort of thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any woman whos been to a good eventful girls school lives on the memory of it for the rest of her life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its one of the pathetic things about womenthe superiority of school and collegeto anything they get afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this citygarden of women will have beautiful places for music places for beautiful dresses places for beautiful work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and no manexcept to do rough work perhapsever comes in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men live in a world where they can hunt and engineer invent and mine and manufacture sail ships drink deep and practice the arts and fight yes i said but he stilled me with a gesture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the homes of the women ponderevo will be set in the wall of their city each woman will have her own particular house and home furnished after her own heart in her own mannerwith a little balcony on the outside wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> built into the walland a little balcony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there she will go and look out when the mood takes her and all round the city there will be a broad road and seats and great shady trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men will stroll up and down there when they feel the need of feminine company when for instance they want to talk about their souls or their characters or any of the things that only women will stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the women will lean over and look at the men and smile and talk to them as they fancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and each woman will have this she will have a little silken ladder she can let down if she there perhapsyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theyd have to abide by the womens i raised one or two difficulties and for a while we played with this idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ewart i said this is like dolls island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose i reflected an unsuccessful man laid siege to a move him on said ewart by a special regulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you could forbid itmake it against the etiquette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no life is decent without hm i said and was struck by an idea that is remote in the world of a young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd turn out the boys when they were seven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the father must come with a little pony and a little gun and manly wear and take the boy away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then one could come afterwards to ones mothers balcony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be fine to have a mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is all very pretty in its way i said at last but its a dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i want to know is what are you going to do in brompton let us say or walham green oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a chap you are ponderevo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he made an abrupt end to his discourse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wouldnt even reply to my tentatives for a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the busts of the caesars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont see the people who do things handsa series of hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hands of the twentieth century <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some day some one will discover itgo theresee on the tombs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the unknown master of the highgate slope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the little soft feminine hands the nervous ugly males the hands of the flops and the hands of the snatchers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and grundys loose lean knuckly affairgrundy the terror!the little wrinkles and the thumb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only it ought to hold all the others togetherin a slightly disturbing squeeze....like i forget how many days intervened between that last breaking off of our engagement and marions surrender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i recall now the sharpness of my emotion the concentrated spirit of tears and laughter in my throat as i read the words of her unexpected letteri have thought over everything and i was selfish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rushed off to walham green that evening to give back all she had given me to beat her altogether at giving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was extraordinarily gentle and generous that time i remember and when at last i left her she kissed me very sweetly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were married with all the customary incongruity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gaveperhaps after a while not altogether ungrudginglyand what i gave marion took with a manifest satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all i was being sensible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that we had three livery carriages to the church one of the pairs of horses matched and coachmenwith improvised flavour and very shabby silk hatsbearing white favours on their whips and my uncle intervened with splendour and insisted upon having a wedding breakfast sent in from a caterers in hammersmith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the table had a great display of chrysanthemums and there was orange blossom in the significant place and a wonderful cake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we also circulated upwards of a score of wedges of that accompanied by silverprinted cards in which marions name of ramboat was stricken out by an arrow in favour of ponderevo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had a little rally of marions relations and several friends and friends friends from smithies appeared in the church and drifted vestryward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i produced my aunt and uncle a select group of two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the effect in that shabby little house was one of exhilarating congestion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sideboard in which lived the tablecloth and the apartments card was used for a display of the presents eked out by the unused balance of the silverprinted cards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marion wore the white raiment of a bride white silk and satin that did not suit her that made her seem large and strange to me she obtruded bows and unfamiliar contours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went through all this strange ritual of an english wedding with a sacramental gravity that i was altogether too young and egotistical to comprehend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all extraordinarily central and important to her it was no more than an offensive complicated and disconcerting intrusion of a world i was already beginning to criticise very bitterly to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was all this fuss for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mere indecent advertisement that i had been passionately in love with marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think however that marion was only very remotely aware of my smouldering exasperation at having in the end behaved nicely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had playedup to the extent of dressing my part i had an admirably cut frockcoat a new silk hat trousers as light as i could endure themlighter in facta white waistcoat night tie light gloves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marion seeing me despondent had the unusual enterprise to whisper to me that i looked lovely i knew too well i didnt look myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked like a special coloured supplement to mens wear or the tailor and cutter full dress for ceremonial occasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had even the disconcerting sensations of an unfamiliar collar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt lostin a strange body and when i glanced down myself for reassurance the straight white abdomen the alien legs confirmed that impression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncle was my best man and looked like a bankera little bankerin flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore a white rose in his buttonhole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wasnt i think particularly talkative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least i recall very little from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george he said once or twice this is a great occasion for youa very great occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i had told him nothing about marion until about a week before the wedding both he and my aunt had been taken altogether by surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they couldnt as people say make it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt was intensely interested much more than my uncle it was then i think for the first time that i really saw that she cared for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she got me alone i remember after i had made my announcement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now george she said tell me everything about i was surprised to find how difficult it was to tell her about marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what youll think of her i parried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think and while i dont remember anything my uncle said or did at the wedding i do remember very distinctly certain little things scrutiny solicitude a curious rare flash of intimacy in my aunts eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it dawned on me that i wasnt hiding anything from her at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was dressed very smartly wearing a bigplumed hat that made her neck seem longer and slenderer than ever and when she walked up the aisle with that rolling stride of hers and her eye all on marion perplexed into selfforgetfulness it wasnt somehow funny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was i do believe giving my marriage more thought than i had done she was concerned beyond measure at my black rage and marions blindness she was looking with eyes that knew what loving isfor love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the vestry she turned away as we signed and i verily believe she was crying though to this day i cant say why she should have cried and she was near crying too when she squeezed my hand at partingand she never said a word or looked at me but just squeezed my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had not been so grim in spirit i think i should have found much of my wedding amusing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember a lot of ridiculous detail that still declines to be funny in my memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the officiating clergyman had a cold and turned his ns to ds and he made the most mechanical compliment conceivable about the brides age when the register was signed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every bride he had ever married had had it one knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and two middleaged spinsters cousins of marions and dressmakers at barking stand out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wore marvellously bright and gay blouses and dim old skirts and had an immense respect for mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they threw rice they brought a whole bag with them and gave handfuls away to unknown little boys at the church door and so created a lilliputian riot and one had meant to throw a slipper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a very warm old silk slipper i know because she dropped it out of a pocket in the aislethere was a sort of jumble in the aisleand i picked it up for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think she actually threw it for as we drove away from the church i saw her in a dreadful and it seemed to me hopeless struggle with her pocket and afterwards my eye caught the missile of good fortune lying it or its fellow most obviously mislaid behind the umbrellastand in the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole business was much more absurd more incoherent more human than i had anticipated but i was far too young and serious to let the latter quality atone for its shortcomings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am so remote from this phase of my youth that i can look back at it all as dispassionately as one looks at a pictureat some wonderful perfect sort of picture that is inexhaustible but at the time these things filled me with unspeakable resentment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i go round it all look into its details generalise about its aspects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im interested for example to square it with my bladesover theory of the british social scheme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under stress of tradition we were all of us trying in the fermenting chaos of london to carry out the marriage ceremonies of a bladesover tenant or one of the chubby middling sort of people in some dependent country town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there a marriage is a public function with a public significance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there the church is to a large extent the gatheringplace of the community and your going to be married a thing of importance to every one you pass on the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a change of status that quite legitimately interests the whole neighbourhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in london there are no neighbours nobody knows nobody cares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an absolute stranger in an office took my notice and our banns were proclaimed to ears that had never previously heard our names <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clergyman even who married us had never seen us before and didnt in any degree intimate that he wanted to see us again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ramboats did not know the names of the people on either side of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i waited for marion before we started off upon our honeymoon flight mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ramboat i remember came and stood beside me and stared out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a funeral over there yesterday he said by way of making conversation and moved his head at the house opposite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and our little procession of three carriages with whitefavouradorned horses and drivers went through all the huge noisy indifferent traffic like a lost china image in the coalchute of an ironclad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody made way for us nobody cared for us the driver of an omnibus jeered for a long time we crawled behind an unamiable dustcart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the irrelevant clatter and tumult gave a queer flavour of indecency to this public shamelessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowd that gathered outside the church would have gathered in the same spirit and with greater alacrity for a street accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at charing crosswe were going to hastingsthe experienced eye of the guard detected the significance of our unusual costume and he secured us a compartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i as the train moved out of the station thats all over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i turned to mariona little unfamiliar still in her unfamiliar clothesand smiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i and by way of answer took and kissed her whitegloved leatherscented hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont remember much else about the journey an hour or so it was of undistinguished timefor we were both confused and a little fatigued and marion had a slight headache and did not want caresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fell into a reverie about my aunt and realised as if it were a new discovery that i cared for her very greatly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was acutely sorry i had not told her earlier of my marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you will not want to hear the history of my honeymoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have told all that was needed to serve my present purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus and thus it was the will in things had its way with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> driven by forces i did not understand diverted altogether from the science the curiosities and work to which i had once given myself i fought my way through a tangle of traditions customs obstacles and absurdities enraged myself limited myself gave myself to occupations i saw with the clearest vision were dishonourable and vain and at last achieved the end of purblind nature the relentless immediacy of her desire and held far short of happiness marion weeping and reluctant in my arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who can tell the story of the slow estrangement of two married people the weakening of first this bond and then that of that complex contact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> least of all can one of the two participants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even now with an interval of fifteen years to clear it up for me i still find a mass of impressions of marion as confused as discordant as unsystematic and selfcontradictory as life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think of this thing and love her of that and hate herof a hundred aspects in which i can now see her with an unimpassioned sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i sit here trying to render some vision of this infinitely confused process i recall moments of hard and fierce estrangement moments of clouded intimacy the passage of transition all forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we talked a little language together whence were friends and i was mutney and she was ming and we kept up such an outward show that till the very end smithie thought our household the most amiable in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot tell to the full how marion thwarted me and failed in that life of intimate emotions which is the kernel of love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that life of intimate emotions is made up of little things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a beautiful face differs from an ugly one by a difference of surfaces and proportions that are sometimes almost infinitesimally small <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i find myself setting down little things and little things none of them do more than demonstrate those essential temperamental discords i have already sought to make clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some readers will understandto others i shall seem no more than an unfeeling brute who couldnt make allowances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its easy to make allowances now but to be young and ardent and to make allowances to see ones married life open before one the life that seemed in its dawn a glory a garden of roses a place of deep sweet mysteries and heart throbs and wonderful silences and to see it a vista of tolerations and babytalk a compromise the least effectual thing in all ones life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every love romance i read seemed to mock our dull intercourse every poem every beautiful picture reflected upon the uneventful succession of grey hours we had together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think our real difference was one of aesthetic sensibility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do still recall as the worst and most disastrous aspect of all that time her absolute disregard of her own beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the pettiest thing to record i know but she could wear curlpapers in my presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was her idea too to wear out her old clothes and her failures at home when no one was likely to see herno one being myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she allowed me to accumulate a store of ungracious and slovenly memories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all our conceptions of life differed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember how we differed about furniture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we spent three or four days in tottenham court road and she chose the things she fancied with an inexorable resolutionsweeping aside my suggestions withoh you want such queer things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she pursued some limited clearly seen and experienced idealthat excluded all other possibilities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over every mantel was a mirror that was draped our sideboard was wonderfully good and splendid with beveled glass we had lamps on long metal stalks and cozy corners and plants in grogtubs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there wasnt a place where one could sit and read in the whole house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my books went upon shelves in the diningroom recess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we had a piano though marions playing was at an elementary level <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know it was the cruelest luck for marion that i with my restlessness my scepticism my constantly developing ideas had insisted on marriage with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had no faculty of growth or change she had taken her mould she had set in the limited ideas of her peculiar class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she preserved her conception of what was right in drawingroom chairs and in marriage ceremonial and in every relation of life with a simple and luminous honesty and conviction with an immense unimaginative inflexibilityas a tailorbird builds its nest or a beaver makes its dam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me hasten over this history of disappointments and separation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might tell of waxings and waning of love between us but the whole was waning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes she would do things for me make me a tie or a pair of slippers and fill me with none the less gratitude because the things were absurd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she ran our home and our one servant with a hard bright efficiency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was inordinately proud of house and garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> always by her lights she did her duty by me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the rapid development of tonobungay began to take me into the provinces and i would be away sometimes for a week together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this she did not like it left her dull she said but after a time she began to go to smithies again and to develop an independence of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at smithies she was now a woman with a position she had money to spend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would take smithie to theatres and out to lunch and talk interminably of the business and smithie became a sort of permanent weekender with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also marion got a spaniel and began to dabble with the minor arts with pokerwork and a kodak and hyacinths in glasses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she called once on a neighbour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her parents left walham greenher father severed his connection with the gasworksand came to live in a small house i took for them near us and they were much with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> odd the littleness of the things that exasperate when the fountains of life are embittered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my fatherinlaw was perpetually catching me in moody moments and urging me to take to gardening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think too much he would say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you was to let in a bit with a spade you might soon ave that garden of yours a vision or in a torrent of exasperation i carnt think george why you dont get a bit of glass ere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this sunny corner you cd do and in the summer time he never came in without performing a sort of conjuring trick in the hall and taking cucumbers and tomatoes from unexpected points of his person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all out o my little bit hed say in exemplary tones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left a trail of vegetable produce in the most unusual places on mantel boards sideboards the tops of pictures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how the sudden unexpected tomato could annoy me! <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did much to widen our estrangement that marion and my aunt failed to make friends became by a sort of instinct antagonistic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt to begin with called rather frequently for she was really anxious to know marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first she would arrive like a whirlwind and pervade the house with an atmosphere of hello <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dressed already with that cheerfully extravagant abandon that signalised her accession to fortune and dressed her best for these visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wanted to play the mother to me i fancy to tell marion occult secrets about the way i wore out my boots and how i never could think to put on thicker things in cold weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but marion received her with that defensive suspiciousness of the shy person thinking only of the possible criticism of herself and my aunt perceiving this became nervous and slangy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she says such queer things said marion once discussing her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i said things like she does the queer things my aunt said were nothing to the queer things she didnt say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember her in our drawingroom one day and how she cocked her eyeits the only expressionat the indiarubber plant in a doultonware pot which marion had placed on the corner of the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was on the very verge of speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly she caught my expression and shrank up like a cat that has been discovered looking at the milk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a wicked impulse took her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt say an old word george she insisted looking me full in the eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre a dear i said not to as marion came lowering into the room to welcome her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i felt extraordinarily like a traitorto the indiarubber plant i supposefor all that nothing had been said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your aunt makes game of people was marions verdict and several times we went to the house in beckenham for lunch and once or twice to dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt did her peculiar best to be friends but marion was implacable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was also i know intensely uncomfortable and she adopted as her social method an exhausting silence replying compactly and without giving openings to anything that was said to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gaps between my aunts visits grew wider and wider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my married existence became at last like a narrow deep groove in the broad expanse of interests in which i was living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went about the world i met a great number of varied personalities i read endless books in trains as i went to and fro <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i developed social relationships at my uncles house that marion did not share <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the seeds of new ideas poured in upon me and grew in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those early and middle years of ones third decade are i suppose for a man the years of greatest mental growth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are restless years and full of vague enterprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each time i returned to ealing life there seemed more alien narrow and unattractiveand marion less beautiful and more limited and difficultuntil at last she was robbed of every particle of her magic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave me always a cooler welcome i think until she seemed entirely apathetic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never asked myself then what heartaches she might hide or what her discontents might be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would come home hoping nothing expecting nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was my fated life and i had chosen it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i became more sensitive to the defects i had once disregarded altogether i began to associate her sallow complexion with her temperamental insufficiency and the heavier lines of her mouth and nostril with her moods of discontent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we drifted apart wider and wider the gap opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tired of babytalk and stereotyped little fondlings i tired of the latest intelligence from those wonderful workrooms and showed it all too plainly we hardly spoke when we were alone together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mere unreciprocated physical residue of my passion remainedan exasperation between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no children came to save us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marion had acquired at smithies a disgust and dread of maternity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that was the fruition and quintessence of the horrid elements in life a disgusting thing a last indignity that overtook unwary women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i doubt indeed a little if children would have saved us we should have differed so fatally about their upbringing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> altogether i remember my life with marion as a long distress now hard now tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in those days that i first became critical of my life and burdened with a sense of error and maladjustment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would lie awake in the night asking myself the purpose of things reviewing my unsatisfying ungainly homelife my days spent in rascal enterprise and rubbishselling contrasting all i was being and doing with my adolescent ambitions my wimblehurst dreams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my circumstances had an air of finality and i asked myself in vain why i had forced myself into them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the end of our intolerable situation came suddenly and unexpectedly but in a way that i suppose was almost inevitable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my alienated affections wandered and i was unfaithful to marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont pretend to extenuate the quality of my conduct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a young and fairly vigorous male all my appetite for love had been roused and whetted and none of it had been satisfied by my love affair and my marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had pursued an elusive gleam of beauty to the disregard of all else and it had failed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had faded when i had hoped it would grow brighter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i despaired of life and was embittered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and things happened as i am telling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont draw any moral at all in the matter and as for social remedies i leave them to the social reformer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got to a time of life when the only theories that interest me are generalisations about realities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to go to our inner office in raggett street i had to walk through a room in which the typists worked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were the correspondence typists our books and invoicing had long since overflowed into the premises we had had the luck to secure on either side of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was i must confess always in a faintly cloudilyemotional way aware of that collection of for the most part roundshouldered femininity but presently one of the girls detached herself from the others and got a real hold upon my attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i appreciated her at first as a straight little back a neater back than any of the others as a softly rounded neck with a smiling necklace of sham pearls as chestnut hair very neatly doneand as a sidelong glance presently as a quickly turned face that looked for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my eye would seek her as i went through on business thingsi dictated some letters to her and so discovered she had pretty softlooking hands with pink nails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once or twice meeting casually we looked one another for the flash of a second in the eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was enough in the mysterious freemasonry of sex to say essential things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had a secret between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day i came into raggett street at lunch time and she was alone sitting at her desk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she glanced up as i entered and then became very still with a downcast face and her hands clenched on the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walked right by her to the door of the inner office stopped came back and stood over her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we neither of us spoke for quite a perceptible time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is that one of the new typewriters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked at last for the sake of speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked up at me without a word with her face flushed and her eyes alight and i bent down and kissed her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she leant back to put an arm about me drew my face to her and kissed me again and again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lifted her and held her in my arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave a little smothered cry to feel herself so held <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never before had i known the quality of passionate kisses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody became audible in the shop outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we started back from one another with flushed faces and bright and burning eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant talk here i whispered with a confident intimacy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> along the embankment to charing cross she answered as the door from the shop opened and she sat down very quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im glad i said in a commonplace voice that these new i went into the inner office and routed out the paysheet in order to find her nameeffie rink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and did no work at all that afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fretted about that dingy little den like a beast in a cage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when presently i went out effie was working with an extraordinary appearance of calmand there was no look for me at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we met and had our talk that evening a talk in whispers when there was none to overhear we came to an understanding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was strangely unlike any dream of romance i had ever entertained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came back after a weeks absence to my home againa changed man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had lived out my first rush of passion for effie had come to a contemplation of my position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had gauged effies place in the scheme of things and parted from her for a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was back in her place at raggett street after a temporary indisposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not feel in any way penitent or ashamed i know as i opened the little castiron gate that kept marions front grader and pampas grass from the wandering dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed if anything i felt as if i had vindicated some right that had been in question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came back to marion with no sense of wrongdoing at all with indeed a new friendliness towards her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how it may be proper to feel on such occasions that is how i felt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed her in our drawingroom standing beside the tall lampstand that half filled the bay as though she had just turned from watching for me at the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something in her pale face that arrested me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked as if she had not been sleeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not come forward to greet me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood very still a dusky figure against the bright window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the most amazing moment in any life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walked to the hearthrug and stood quite still there regarding this new situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed a long interval before either of us spoke another word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could you bring yourself i felt a spasm of petulant annoyance at this unexpected catastrophe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like to wring smithies brothers neck i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marion spoke in dry broken fragments of sentences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id always thought that anyhow you couldnt deceive me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose it doesnt strike me as horrid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me the most i became aware of some one moving about in the passage and went and shut the door of the room then i walked back to the hearthrug and turned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its rough on you i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i didnt mean you to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive had the devil of a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why she sat down in a draped armchair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have cared for you she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt mean this thing to smash down on you like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you know something had to happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sorrysorry to the bottom of my heart that things have come to this between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but indeed im taken by surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know where i ami dont know how we got here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found myself alone with her one day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed stupid to go back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besideswhy should i have gone back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from first to last ive hardly she scrutinised my face and pulled at the ballfringe of the little table beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to think of it she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe i can ever touch we kept a long silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was only beginning to realise in the most superficial way the immense catastrophe that had happened between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> enormous issues had rushed upon us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt unprepared and altogether inadequate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there came a rush of stupid expressions to my mind that my rising sense of the supreme importance of the moment saved me from saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gap of silence widened until it threatened to become the vast memorable margin of some one among a thousand trivial possibilities of speech that would vex our relations for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our little general servant tapped at the doormarion always liked the servant to tapand appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tea mm she saidand vanished leaving the door open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will go upstairs said i and stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will go upstairs we remained motionless and silent for a few seconds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mother is having tea with us today marion remarked at last and dropped the worried end of ballfringe and stood up slowly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so with this immense discussion of our changed relations hanging over us we presently had tea with the unsuspecting mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ramboat was too well trained in her position to remark upon our somber preoccupation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she kept a thin trickle of talk going and told us i remember that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ramboat was troubled about his cannas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont come up and they wont come up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes been round and had an explanation with the man who sold him the bulbsand hes the spaniel was a great bore begging and doing small tricks first at one and then at the other of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither of us used his name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see we had called him miggles and made a sort of trio in the babytalk of mutney and miggles and ming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then presently we resumed our monstrous momentous dialogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant now make out how long that dialogue went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it spread itself i know in heavy fragments over either three days or four <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember myself grouped with marion talking sitting on our bed in her room talking standing in our diningroom saving this thing or that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice we went for long walks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we had a long evening alone together with jaded nerves and hearts that fluctuated between a hard and dreary recognition of facts and on my part at least a strange unwonted tenderness because in some extraordinary way this crisis had destroyed our mutual apathy and made us feel one another again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a dialogue that had discrepant parts that fell into lumps of talk that failed to join on to their predecessors that began again at a different level higher or lower that assumed new aspects in the intervals and assimilated new considerations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we discussed the fact that we two were no longer lovers never before had we faced that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems a strange thing to write but as i look back i see clearly that those several days were the time when marion and i were closest together looked for the first and last time faithfully and steadfastly into each others soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for those days only there were no pretences i made no concessions to her nor she to me we concealed nothing exaggerated nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had it out plainly and soberly with each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mood followed mood and got its stark expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course there was quarreling between us bitter quarreling and we said things to one anotherlong pentup things that bruised and crushed and cut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but over it all in my memory now is an effect of deliberate confrontation and the figure of marion stands up pale melancholy tearstained injured implacable and dignified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked once and jerked that doubt into my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i struggled with tangled ideas and emotions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what love is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all sorts of thingsits made of a dozen strands do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said with the exasperation of the situation growing upon as i look back upon all that timeacross a gulf of fifteen active yearsi find i see it with an understanding judgment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see it as if it were the business of some one elseindeed of two other peopleintimately known yet judged without passion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see now that this shock this sudden immense disillusionment did in real fact bring out a mind and soul in marion that for the first time she emerged from habits timidities imitations phrases and a certain narrow willimpulse and became a personality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her ruling motive at first was i think an indignant and outraged pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she asked me categorically to give up effie and i full of fresh and glowing memories absolutely refused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we cant very well go on living together she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can slowly we worked our way from point to point until at last the word divorce was before us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we cant live together we ought to be free said marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know anything of divorce i saidif you mean that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know how it is done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall have to ask somebodyor look it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps after all it is the thing to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we we began to talk ourselves into a realisation of what our divergent futures might be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came back on the evening of that day with my questions answered by a solicitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant as a matter of fact i said get divorced as things are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> apparently so far as the law goes youve got to stand this sort of thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its silly but that is the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however its easy to arrange a divorce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in addition to adultery there must be desertion or cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to establish cruelty i should have to strike you or something of that sort before witnesses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats impossiblebut its simple to desert you legally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have to go away from you thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can go on sending you moneyand you bring a suit what is it?for restitution of conjugal rights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the court orders me to return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you can go on to divorce me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you get a decree nisi and once more the court tries to make me come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we dont make it up within six months and if you dont behave scandalously the decree is made absolute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the end of the fuss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats how one gets youll have an income <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from a third to a half of my present incomemore if you likei dont mindthree hundred a year say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got your old people to keep and and all this life youve hated i looked up at her wrung and bitter face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent hated it i lied my voice near breaking with the pain of it all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have the perplexing thing about life is the irresolvable complexity of reality of things and relations alike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every wrong done has a certain justice in it and every good deed has dregs of evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for us young still and still without selfknowledge resounded a hundred discordant notes in the harsh angle of that shock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were furiously angry with each other tender with each other callously selfish generously selfsacrificing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember marion saying innumerable detached things that didnt hang together one with another that contradicted one another that were nevertheless all in their places profoundly true and sincere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see them now as so many vain experiments in her effort to apprehend the crumpled confusions of our complex moral landslide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some i found irritating beyond measure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course she would say again and again my life has been a ive besieged you for three years i would retort asking it not to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ive turned away at last or again she would revive all the stresses before our marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she would try over the aspects of our new separated lives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to earn my own living she would insist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to be quite independent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps i shall try a poultry farm and bees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wont mind at first my being a burden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> afterwards weve settled all that i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were times when she seemed to regard our separation with absolute complacency when she would plan all sorts of freedoms and characteristic interests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall go out a lot with smithie she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and once she said an ugly thing that i did indeed hate her for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i cannot even now quite forgive her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> into my memory of these pains and stresses comes the figure of smithie fullcharged with emotion so breathless in the presence of the horrid villain of the piece that she could make no articulate sounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had long tearful confidences with marion i know sympathetic close clingings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were moments when only absolute speechlessness prevented her giving me a stupendous talkingtoi could see it in her eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wrong things she would have said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ramboats slow awakening to something in the air the growing expression of solicitude in her eye only her welltrained fear of marion keeping her from speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at last through all this welter like a thing fated and altogether beyond our control parting came to marion and me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hardened my heart or i could not have gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for at the last it came to marion that she was parting from me for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that overbore all other things had turned our last hour to anguish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she forgot for a time the prospect of moving into a new house she forgot the outrage on her proprietorship and pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time in her life she really showed strong emotions in regard to me for the first time perhaps they really came to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she began to weep slow reluctant tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came into her room and found her asprawl on the bed weeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all my life is a wreck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to harden my heart indeed for it seemed to me at moments in those last hours together that at last too late the longedfor thing had happened and marion had come alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a newborn hunger for me lit her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she clung to me she kissed me with tearsalt lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was promised now and pledged and i hardened my heart against this impossible dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet it seems to me that there were moments when it needed but a cry but one word to have united us again for all our lives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would that passage have enlightened us for ever or should we have fallen back in a week or so into the old estrangement the old temperamental opposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of that there is now no telling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our own resolve carried us on our predestined way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we behaved more and more like separating lovers parting inexorably but all the preparations we had set going worked on like a machine and we made no attempt to stop them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my trunks and boxes went to the station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i packed my bag with marion standing before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were like children who had hurt each other horribly in sheer stupidity who didnt know now how to remedy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we belonged to each other immenselyimmensely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cab came to the little iron gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment we held one another in each others arms and kissedincredibly without malice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we heard our little servant in the passage going to open the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the last time we pressed ourselves to one another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were not lovers nor enemies but two human souls in a frank community of pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go away i said to the servant seeing that marion had followed me down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt her standing behind me as i spoke to the cab man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got into the cab resolutely not looking back and then as it started jumped up craned out and looked at the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was wide open but she had disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonderi suppose she ran upstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i parted from marion at an extremity of perturbation and regret and went as i had promised and arranged to effie who was waiting for me in apartments near orpington <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember her upon the station platform a bright flitting figure looking along the train for me and our walk over the fields in the twilight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had expected an immense sense of relief where at last the stresses of separation were over but now i found i was beyond measure wretched and perplexed full of the profoundest persuasion of irreparable error <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dusk and somber marion were so alike her sorrow seemed to be all about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to hold myself to my own plans to remember that i must keep faith with effie with effie who had made no terms exacted no guarantees but flung herself into my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went across the evening fields in silence towards a sky of deepening gold and purple and effie was close beside me always very close glancing up ever and again at my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly she knew i grieved for marion that ours was now no joyful reunion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she showed no resentment and no jealousy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> extraordinarily she did not compete against marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never once in all our time together did she say an adverse word of marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she set herself presently to dispel the shadow that brooded over me with the same instinctive skill that some women will show with the trouble of a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made herself my glad and pretty slave and handmaid she forced me at last to rejoice in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet at the back of it all marion remained stupid and tearful and infinitely distressful so that i was almost intolerably unhappy for herfor her and the dead body of my married love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is all as i tell it now unaccountable to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go back into these remote parts these rarely visited uplands and lonely tares of memory and it seems to me still a strange country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had thought i might be going to some sensuous paradise with effie but desire which fills the universe before its satisfaction vanishes utterly like the going of daylightwith achievement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the facts and forms of life remain darkling and cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an upland of melancholy questionings a region from which i saw all the world at new angles and in new aspects i had outflanked passion and romance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had come into a condition of vast perplexities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time in my life at least so it seems to me now in this retrospect i looked at my existence as a whole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since this was nothing what was i doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was going to and fro about tonobungaythe business i had taken up to secure marion and which held me now in spite of our intimate separationand snatching odd weekends and nights for orpington and all the while i struggled with these obstinate interrogations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to fall into musing in the trains i became even a little inaccurate and forgetful about business things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have the clearest memory of myself sitting thoughtful in the evening sunlight on a grassy hillside that looked toward seven oaks and commanded a wide sweep of country and that i was thinking out my destiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could almost write my thought down now i believe as they came to me that afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie restless little cockney that she was rustled and struggled in a hedgerow below gathering flowers discovering flowers she had never seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember a letter from marion in my pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had even made some tentatives for return for a reconciliation heaven knows now how i had put it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but her cold illwritten letter repelled me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i perceived i could never face that old inconclusive dullness of life again that stagnant disappointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see no way of honour or fine living before me at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what am i to do with life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the question that besieged me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered if all the world was even as i urged to this by one motive and to that by another creatures of chance and impulse and unmeaning traditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had i indeed to abide by what i had said and done and chosen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was there nothing for me in honour but to provide for effie go back penitent to marion and keep to my trade in rubbishor find some fresh oneand so work out the residue of my days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt accept that for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what else was i to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered if my case was the case of many men whether in former ages too men had been so guideless so uncharted so haphazard in their journey into life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle ages in the old catholic days one went to a priest and he said with all the finality of natural law this you are and this you must do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered whether even in the middle ages i should have accepted that ruling without question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember too very distinctly how effie came and sat beside me on a little box that was before the casement window of our room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i smiled and remained head on hand looking out of the window forgetful of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you love your wife so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cried recalled again i dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> life is a thing that hurts my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it hurts without logic or reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i turned about and drew her to me and kissed her ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i had a very bad timei still recall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suffered i suppose from a sort of ennui of the imagination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found myself without an object to hold my will together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried ewart and got no help from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i regard it all now in this retrospect it seems to me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned aims i discovered myself for the first time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before that i had seen only the world and things in it had sought them selfforgetful of all but my impulse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i found myself grouped with a system of appetites and satisfactions with much work to doand no desire it seemed left in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were moments when i thought of suicide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times my life appeared before me in bleak relentless light a series of ignorances crude blunderings degradation and cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had what the old theologians call a conviction of sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sought salvationnot perhaps in the formula a methodist preacher would recognise but salvation nevertheless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men find their salvation nowadays in many ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> names and forms dont i think matter very much the real need is something that we can hold and that holds one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have known a man find that determining factor in a dryplate factory and another in writing a history of the manor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so long as it holds one it does not matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many men and women nowadays take up some concrete aspect of socialism or social reform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but socialism for me has always been a little bit too human too set about with personalities and foolishness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont like things so human <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think im blind to the fun the surprises the jolly little coarsenesses and insufficiency of life to the humour of it as people say and to adventure but that isnt the root of the matter with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres no humour in my blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im in earnest in warp and woof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stumble and flounder but i know that over all these merry immediate things there are other things that are great and serene very high beautiful thingsthe reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent got it but its there nevertheless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a spiritual guttersnipe in love with unimaginable goddesses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never seen the goddesses nor ever shallbut it takes all the fun out of the mudand at times i fear it takes all the kindliness too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im talking of things i cant expect the reader to understand because i dont half understand them myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is something links things for me a sunset or so a mood or so the high air something there was in marions form and colour something i find and lose in mantegnas pictures something in the lines of these boats i make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should see x my last and i cant explain myself i perceive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it all comes to this that i am a hard and morally limited cad with a mind beyond my merits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally i resist that as a complete solution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow i had a sense of inexorable need of distress and insufficiency that was unendurable and for a time this aeronautical engineering allayed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the end of this particular crisis of which i tell so badly i idealised science <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i decided that in power and knowledge lay the salvation of my life the secret that would fill my need that to these things i would give myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i emerged at last like a man who has been diving in darkness clutching at a new resolve for which he had groped desperately and long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came into the inner office suddenly one dayit must have been just before the time of marions suit for restitutionand sat down before my uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he answered and put some papers aside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes been a stupid girl george he said i partly understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youre quit of her now practically and theres just as good fish in the sea oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats only the part that shows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want something to hold on to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall go amok if i dont get it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a different sort of beast from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you float in all this bunkum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel like a man floundering in a universe of soapsuds up and downs east and west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must get my foot on i laughed at the consternation in his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall go in for workreal work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this isnt work its only laborious cheating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its an old ideai thought of years ago but it came back to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should i fence about with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe the time has come for flying to be possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stuck to that and it helped me through the worst time in my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncle after some halfhearted resistance and a talk with my aunt behaved like the father of a spoilt son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fixed up an arrangement that gave me capital to play with released me from too constant a solicitude for the newer business developmentsthis was in what i may call the later moggs period of our enterprisesand i went to work at once with grim intensity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i will tell of my soaring and flying machines in the proper place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been leaving the story of my uncle altogether too long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted merely to tell how it was i took to this work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took to these experiments after i had sought something that marion in some indefinable way had seemed to promise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i toiled and forgot myself for a time and did many things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> science too has been something of an irresponsive mistress since though ive served her better than i served marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the time science with her order her inhuman distance yet steely certainties saved me from despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i have still to fly but incidentally i have invented the lightest engines in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am trying to tell of all the things that happened to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its hard enough simply to get it put down in the remotest degree right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this is a novel not a treatise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont imagine that i am coming presently to any sort of solution of my difficulties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here among my drawings and hammerings now i still question unanswering problems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all my life has been at bottom seeking disbelieving always dissatisfied always with the thing seen and the thing believed seeking something in toil in force in danger something whose name and nature i do not clearly understand something beautiful worshipful enduring mine profoundly and fundamentally and the utter redemption of myself i dont knowall i can tell is that it is something i have ever failed to find <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before i finish this chapter and book altogether and go on with the great adventure of my uncles career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may perhaps tell what else remains to tell of marion and effie and then for a time set my private life behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time marion and i corresponded with some regularity writing friendly but rather uninforming letters about small business things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clumsy process of divorce completed itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she left the house at ealing and went into the country with her aunt and parents taking a small farm near lewes in sussex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put up glass she put in heat for her father happy man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and spoke of figs and peaches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing seemed to promise well throughout a spring and summer but the sussex winter after london was too much for the ramboats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they got very muddy and dull mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ramboat killed a cow by improper feeding and that disheartened them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a twelvemonth saw the enterprise in difficulties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to help her out of this and then they returned to london and she went into partnership with smithie at streatham and ran a business that was intimated on the firms stationery as robes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the parents and aunt were stowed away in a cottage somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that the letters became infrequent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in one i remember a postscript that had a little stab of our nearly eight years slipped by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i grew in experience in capacity until i was fully a man but with many new interests living on a larger scale in a wider world than i could have dreamt of in my marion days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her letters become rare and insignificant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last came a gap of silence that made me curious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for eighteen months or more i had nothing from marion save her quarterly receipts through the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i damned at smithie and wrote a card to marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear marion i said how goes it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she astonished me tremendously by telling me she had married againa mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wachorn a leading agent in the paperpattern trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she still wrote on the ponderevo and smith robes notepaper from the ponderevo and smith address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that except for a little difference of opinion about the continuance of alimony which gave me some passages of anger and the use of my name by the firm which also annoyed me is the end of marions history for me and she vanishes out of this story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know where she is or what she is doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know whether she is alive or dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me utterly grotesque that two people who have stood so close to one another as she and i should be so separated but so it is between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie too i have parted from though i still see her at times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between us there was never any intention of marriage nor intimacy of soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a sudden fierce hotblooded passion for me and i for her but i was not her first lover nor her last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was in another world from marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a queer delightful nature ive no memory of ever seeing her sullen or malicious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i think was the central secret of her agreeableness and moreover that she was infinitely kindhearted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i helped her at last into an opening she coveted and she amazed me by a sudden display of business capacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has now a typewriting bureau in riffles inn and she runs it with a brisk vigour and considerable success albeit a certain plumpness has overtaken her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she still loves her kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she married a year or so ago a boy half her agea wretch of a poet a wretched poet and given to drugs a thing with lank fair hair always getting into his blue eyes and limp legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did it she said because he needed nursing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but enough of this disaster of my marriage and of my early love affairs i have told all that is needed for my picture to explain how i came to take up aeroplane experiments and engineering science let me get back to my essential story to tonobungay and my uncles promotions and to the vision of the world these things have given me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now that i resume the main line of my story it may be well to describe the personal appearance of my uncle as i remember him during those magnificent years that followed his passage from trade to finance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little man plumped up very considerably during the creation of the tonobungay property but with the increasing excitements that followed that first flotation came dyspepsia and a certain flabbiness and falling away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his abdomenif the reader will pardon my taking his features in the order of their valuehad at first a nice full roundness but afterwards it lost tone without however losing size <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he always went as though he was proud of it and would make as much of it as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the last his movements remained quick and sudden his short firm legs as he walked seemed to twinkle rather than display the scissorsstride of common humanity and he never seemed to have knees but instead a dispersed flexibility of limb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was i seem to remember a secular intensification of his features his nose developed character became aggressive stuck out at the world more and more the obliquity of his mouth i think increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the face that returns to my memory projects a long cigar that is sometimes cocked jauntily up from the higher corner that sometimes droops from the lowerit was as eloquent as a dogs tail and he removed it only for the more emphatic modes of speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he assumed a broad black ribbon for his glasses and wore them more and more askew as time went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hair seemed to stiffen with success but towards the climax it thinned greatly over the crown and he brushed it hard back over his ears where however it stuck out fiercely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it always stuck out fiercely over his forehead up and forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he adopted an urban style of dressing with the onset of tonobungay and rarely abandoned it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he preferred silk hats with ample rich brims often a trifle large for him by modern ideas and he wore them at various angles to his axis his taste in trouserings was towards fairly emphatic stripes and his trouser cut was neat he liked his frockcoat long and full although that seemed to shorten him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he displayed a number of valuable rings and i remember one upon his left little finger with a large red stone bearing gnostic symbols <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clever chaps those gnostics george he told me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never had any but a black mohair watchchair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the country he affected grey and a large grey cloth tophat except when motoring then he would have a brown deerstalker cap and a fur suit of esquimaux cut with a sort of bootend to the trousers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of an evening he would wear white waistcoats and plain gold studs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> might as well wearan income taxreceipt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all very well for park so much for his visible presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time it was very familiar to the world for at the crest of the boom he allowed quite a number of photographs and at least one pencil sketch to be published in the sixpenny papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his voice declined during those years from his early tenor to a flat rich quality of sound that my knowledge of music is inadequate to describe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his zzzing inrush of air became less frequent as he ripened but returned in moments of excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> throughout his career in spite of his increasing and at last astounding opulence his more intimate habits remained as simple as they had been at wimblehurst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would never avail himself of the services of a valet at the very climax of his greatness his trousers were folded by a housemaid and his shoulders brushed as he left his house or hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he became wary about breakfast as life advanced and at one time talked much of dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for other meals he remained reasonably omnivorous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was something of a gastronome and would eat anything he particularly liked in an audible manner and perspire upon his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a studiously moderate drinkerexcept when the spirit of some public banquet or some great occasion caught him and bore him beyond his warinessthere he would as it were drink inadvertently and become flushed and talkativeabout everything but his business projects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make the portrait complete one wants to convey an effect of sudden quick bursts of movement like the jumps of a chinesecracker to indicate that his pose whatever it is has been preceded and will be followed by a rush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were painting him i should certainly give him for a background that distressed uneasy sky that was popular in the eighteenth century and at a convenient distance a throbbing motorcar very big and contemporary a secretary hurrying with papers and an alert chauffeur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such was the figure that created and directed the great property of tonobungay and from the successful reconstruction of that company passed on to a slow crescendo of magnificent creations and promotions until the whole world of investors marveled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have already i think mentioned how long before we offered tono bungay to the public we took over the english agency of certain american specialties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this was presently added our exploitation of moggs domestic soap and so he took up the domestic convenience campaign that coupled with his equatorial rotundity and a certain resolute convexity in his bearings won my uncle his napoleonic title <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it illustrates the romantic element in modern commerce that my uncle met young moggs at a city dinneri think it was the bottlemakers companywhen both were some way advanced beyond the initial sobriety of the occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the grandson of the original moggs and a very typical instance of an educated cultivated degenerate plutocrat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his people had taken him about in his youth as the ruskins took their john and fostered a passion for history in him and the actual management of the moggs industry had devolved upon a cousin and a junior partner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moggs being of a studious and refined disposition had just decidedafter a careful search for a congenial subject in which he would not be constanty reminded of soapto devote himself to the history of the thebaid when this cousin died suddenly and precipitated responsibilities upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the frankness of conviviality moggs bewailed the uncongenial task thus thrust into his hands and my uncle offered to lighten his burden by a partnership then and there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they even got to termsextremely muzzy terms but terms nevertheless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each gentleman wrote the name and address of the other on his cuff and they separated in a mood of brotherly carelessness and next morning neither seems to have thought to rescue his shirt from the wash until it was too late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncle made a painful struggleit was one of my business morningsto recall name and particulars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was an aquariumfaced long blond sort of chap george with glasses and a genteel accent he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know how they look at you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his stuff was soap im pretty nearly certain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he had a nameand the thing was the straightest bitofallright you ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was clear enough to we went out at last with knitted brows and wandered up into finsbury seeking a good wellstocked looking grocer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we called first on a chemist for a pickmeup for my uncle and then we found the shop we needed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want said my uncle half a pound of every sort of soap you got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i want to take them now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the third repetition of that question the young man said right said my uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come along george lets go to a telephone and get on to moggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> send it allsend it all to the bishop of london hell have some good use for itfirstrate man george he ischarities and all thatand then we went on to moggs and found him in a camelhair dressingjacket in a luxurious bed drinking china tea and got the shape of everything but the figures fixed by lunch time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young moggs enlarged my mind considerably he was a sort of thing i hadnt met before he seemed quite clean and wellinformed and he assured me to never read newspapers nor used soap in any form at all delicate skin he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no objection to our advertising you wide and free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i draw the line at railway stations said moggs southcoast cliffs theatre programmes books by me and poetry well get along said my uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so long as you dont annoy me said moggs lighting a we certainly made him no poorer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his was the first firm that was advertised by a circumstantial history we even got to illustrated magazine articles telling of the quaint past of moggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trusting to our partners preoccupation with the uncommercial aspects of life we gave graceful historyof moggs the first moggs the second moggs the third and moggs the fourth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must unless you are very young remember some of them and our admirable block of a georgian shop window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncle brought early nineteenthcentury memoirs soaked himself in the style and devised stories about old moggs the first and the duke of wellington george the third and the soap dealer almost certainly old moggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very soon we had added to the original moggs primrose several varieties of scented and superfatted a special nurseries used in the household of the duke of kent and for the old queen in infancy a plate powder the paragon and a knife powder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we roped in a good little secondrate blacklead firm and carried their origins back into the mists of antiquity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was my uncles own unaided idea that we should associate that commodity with the black prince <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he became industriously curious about the past of blacklead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember his buttonholing the president of the pepys society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say is there any blacklead in pepys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or does he pass it over as a matter of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he became in those days the terror of eminent historians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont want your drum and trumpet historyno fear he used to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont want to know who was whos mistress and why soandso devastated such a province thats bound to be all lies and upsydown anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chaps who did it didnt clearly know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i want to know is in the middle ages did they do anything for housemaids knee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what did they put in their hot baths after jousting and was the black princeyou know the black princewas he enameled or painted or what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think myself blackleadedvery so it came about that in designing and writing those moggs soap advertisements that wrought a revolution in that department of literature my uncle was brought to realise not only the lost history but also the enormous field for invention and enterprise that lurked among the little articles the dustpans and mincers the mousetraps and carpetsweepers that fringe the shops of the oilman and domestic ironmonger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was recalled to one of the dreams of his youth to his conception of the ponderevo patent flat that had been in his mind so early as the days before i went to serve him at wimblehurst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the home george he said wants straightening up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> things that get in the for a time he displayed something like the zeal of a genuine social reformer in relation to these matters <end> <end>

<start> <start> balls of string that wont dissolve into a tangle and gum that wont dry into horn <end> <end>

<start> <start> all the polishes and things in such tinsyoull want to cuddle em george <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sted of all the silly ugly things we got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had some magnificent visions they so affected me that when i passed ironmongers and oilshops they seemed to me as full of promise as trees in late winter flushed with the effort to burst into leaf and flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and really we did do much towards that very brightness these shops display <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were dingy things in the eighties compared to what our efforts have made them now grey quiet displays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont intend to write down here the tortuous financial history of moggs limited which was our first development of moggs and sons nor will i tell very much of how from that we spread ourselves with a larger and larger conception throughout the chandlery and minor ironmongery how we became agents for this little commodity partners in that got a tentacle round the neck of a specialised manufacturer or so secured a pull upon this or that supply of raw material and so prepared the way for our second flotation domestic utilities do it they reordered it in the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then came the reconstruction of tonobungay and then household services and the boom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that sort of development is not to he told in detail in a novel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have indeed told much of it elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is to be found set out at length painfully at length in my uncles examination and mine in the bankruptcy proceedings and in my own various statements after his death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some people know everything in that story some know it all too well most do not want the details <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the story of a man of imagination among figures and unless you are prepared to collate columns of pounds shillings and pence compare dates and check additions you will find it very unmeaning and perplexing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after all you wouldnt find the early figures so much wrong as strained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the matter of moggs and do ut as in the first tonobungay promotion and in its reconstruction we left the court by city standards without a stain on our characters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great amalgamation of household services was my uncles first really bigscale enterprise and his first display of bolder methods for this we bought back do ut moggs going strong with a seven per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dividend and acquired skinnertons polishes the riffleshaw properties and the runcorns mincer and coffeemill business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to that amalgamation i was really not a party i left it to my uncle because i was then beginning to get keen upon the soaring experiments i had taken on from the results then to hand of lilienthal pilcher and the wright brothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was developing a glider into a flyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meant to apply power to this glider as soon as i could work out one or two residual problems affecting the longitudinal stability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that i had a sufficiently light motor in my own modification of bridgers light turbine but i knew too that until i had cured my aeroplane of a tendency demanding constant alertness from me a tendency to jerk up its nose at unexpected moments and slide back upon me the application of an engine would be little short of suicide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that i will tell about later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the point i was coming to was that i did not realise until after the crash how recklessly my uncle had kept his promise of paying a dividend of over eight per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the ordinary shares of that hugely overcapitalised enterprise household services <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i drifted out of business affairs into my research much more than either i or my uncle had contemplated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finance was much less to my taste than the organisation of the tonobungay factory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the new field of enterprise there was a great deal of bluffing and gambling of taking chances and concealing material factsand these are hateful things to the scientific type of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wasnt fear i felt so much as an uneasy inaccuracy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt realise dangers i simply disliked the sloppy relaxing quality of this new sort of work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was at last constantly making excuses not to come up to him in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter part of his business career recedes therefore beyond the circle of any particular life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lived more or less with him i talked i advised i helped him at times to fight his sunday crowd at crest hill but i did not follow nor guide him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the do ut time onward he rushed up the financial world like a bubble in water and left me like some busy waterthing down below in the deeps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow he was an immense success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the public was i think particularly attracted by the homely familiarity of his field of workyou never lost sight of your investment they felt with the name on the houseflannel and shavingstropand its allegiance was secured by the egyptian solidity of his apparent results <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tonobungay after its reconstruction paid thirteen moggs seven domestic utilities had been a safelooking nine here was household services with eight on such a showing he had merely to buy and sell roeburns antiseptic fluid razor soaks and bath crystals in three weeks to clear twenty thousand pounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do think that as a matter of fact roeburns was good value at the price at which he gave it to the public at least until it was strained by illconserved advertisement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a period of expansion and confidence much money was seeking investment and industrials were the fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there remained little more for my uncle to do therefore in his climb to the high unstable crest of financial greatness but as he said to grasp the cosmic oyster george while it gaped which being translated meant for him to buy respectable businesses confidently and courageously at the vendors estimate add thirty or forty thousand to the price and sell them again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his sole difficulty indeed was the tactful management of the load of shares that each of these transactions left upon his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i thought so little of these later things that i never fully appreciated the peculiar inconveniences of that until it was too late to help him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i think of my uncle near the days of his great boom and in connection with the actualities of his enterprises i think of him as i used to see him in the suite of rooms he occupied in the hardingham hotel seated at a great old oak writingtable smoking drinking and incoherently busy that was his typical financial aspectour evenings our mornings our holidays our motorcar expeditions lady grove and crest hill belong to an altogether different set of memories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these rooms in the hardingham were a string of apartments along one handsome thickcarpeted corridor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the doors upon the corridor were locked except the first and my uncles bedroom breakfastroom and private sanctum were the least accessible and served by an entrance from the adjacent passage which he also used at times as a means of escape from importunate callers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most eternal room was a general waitingroom and very businesslike in quality it had one or two uneasy sofas a number of chairs a green baize table and a collection of the very best moggs and tone posters and the plush carpets normal to the hardingham had been replaced by a greygreen cork linoleum here i would always find a remarkable miscellany of people presided over by a peculiarly faithful and ferocious looking commissioner ropper who guarded the door that led a step nearer my uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> usually there would be a parson or so and one or two widows hairy eyeglassy middleaged gentlemen some of them looking singularly like edward ponderevos who hadnt come off a variety of young and youngish men more or less attractively dressed some with papers protruding from their pockets others with their papers decently concealed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all these persons maintained a practically hopeless siegesometimes for weeks together they had better have stayed at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next came a room full of people who had some sort of appointment and here one would find smartlooking people brilliantly dressed nervous women hiding behind magazines nonconformist divines clergy in gaiters real business men these latter for the most part gentlemen in admirable morning dress who stood up and scrutinised my uncles taste in water colours manfully and sometimes by the hour together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young men again were here of various social origins young americans treasonable clerks from other concerns university young men keenlooking most of them resolute reserved but on a sort of hair trigger ready at any moment to be most voluble most persuasive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this room had a window too looking out into the hotel courtyard with its fernset fountains and mosaic pavement and the young men would stand against this and sometimes even mutter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day i heard one repeating in all urgent whisper as i passed but you dont quite see mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ponderevo the full advantages the full advantages i met his eye and he was embarrassed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came a room with a couple of secretariesno typewriters because my uncle hated the clatterand a casual person or two sitting about projectors whose projects were being entertained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and in a further room nearer the private apartments my uncles correspondence underwent an exhaustive process of pruning and digestion before it reached him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the two little rooms in which my uncle talked my magic uncle who had got the investing publicto whom all things were possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as one came in we would find him squatting with his cigar up and an expression of dubious beatitude upon his face while some one urged him to grow still richer by this or that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wise i was always ready to listen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all sorts of financial marvels came out of the hardingham more particularly during my uncles last great flurry but they were nothing to the projects that passed in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the little brown and gold room he sat in usually <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had had it redecorated by bordingly and half a dozen sussex pictures by webster hung about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> latterly he wore a velveteen jacket of a goldenbrown colour in this apartment that i think overemphasised its esthetic intention and he also added some gross chinese bronzes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was on the whole a very happy man throughout all that wildly enterprising time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made and as i shall tell in its place spent great sums of money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was constantly in violent motion constantly stimulated mentally and physically and rarely tired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about him was an atmosphere of immense deference much of his waking life was triumphal and all his dreams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i doubt if he had any dissatisfaction with himself at all until the crash bore him down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> things must have gone very rapidly with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think he must have been very happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i sit here writing about all these things jerking down notes and throwing them aside in my attempt to give some literary form to the tale of our promotions the marvel of it all comes to me as if it came for the first time the supreme unreason of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the climax of his boom my uncle at the most sparing estimate must have possessed in substance and credit about two million poundsworth of property to set off against his vague colossal liabilities and from first to last he must have had a controlling influence in the direction of nearly thirty millions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this irrational muddle of a community in which we live gave him that paid him at that rate for sitting in a room and scheming and telling it lies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he created nothing he invented nothing he economised nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot claim that a single one of the great businesses we organised added any real value to human life at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several like tonobungay were unmitigated frauds by any honest standard the giving of nothing coated in advertisements for money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the things the hardingham gave out i repeat were nothing to the things that came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think of the long procession of people who sat down before us and propounded this and that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it was a device for selling bread under a fancy name and so escaping the laws as to weightthis was afterwards floated as the decorticated healthbread company and bumped against the lawnow it was a new scheme for still more strident advertisement now it was a story of unsuspected deposits of minerals now a cheap and nasty substitute for this or that common necessity now the treachery of a too wellinformed employee anxious to become our partner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all put to us tentatively persuasively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes one had a large pink blusterous person trying to carry us off our feet by his pseudoboyish frankness now some dyspeptically yellow whisperer now some earnest specially dressed youth with an eyeglass and a buttonhole now some homelyspeaking shrewd manchester man or some scotchman eager to be very clear and full <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many came in couples or trios often in tow of an explanatory solicitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some were white and earnest some flustered beyond measure at their opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of them begged and prayed to be taken up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncle chose what he wanted and left the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he became very autocratic to these applicants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt he could make them and they felt so too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had but to say no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they faded out of existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had become a sort of vortex to which wealth flowed of its own accord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his possessions increased by heaps his shares his leaseholds and mortgages and debentures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind his firstline things he found it necessary at last and sanctioned by all the precincts to set up three general trading companies the london and african investment company the british traders loan company and business organisations limited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was in the culminating time when i had least to do with affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont say that with any desire to exculpate myself i admit i was a director of all three and i will confess i was willfully incurious in that capacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each of these companies ended its financial year solvent by selling great holdings of shares to one or other of its sisters and paying a dividend out of the proceeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat at the table and agreed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was our method of equilibrium at the iridescent climax of the bubble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you perceive now however the nature of the services for which this fantastic community have him unmanageable wealth and power and real respect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all a monstrous payment for courageous fiction a gratuity in return for the one reality of human lifeillusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we gave them a feeling of hope and profit we sent a tidal wave of water and confidence into their stranded affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we mint faith george said my uncle one day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by jove we got to keep minting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we been making human confidence ever since i drove the first cork of coining would have been a better word than minting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet you know in a sense he was right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> civilisation is possible only through confidence so that we can bank our money and go unarmed about the streets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bank reserve or a policeman keeping order in a jostling multitude of people are only slightly less impudent bluffs than my uncles prospectuses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they couldnt for a moment make good if the quarter of what they guarantee was demanded of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole of this modern mercantile investing civilisation is indeed such stuff as dreams are made of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mass of people swelters and toils great railway systems grow cities arise to the skies and spread wide and far mines are opened factories hum foundries roar ships plough the seas countries are settled about this busy striving world the rich owners go controlling all enjoying all confident and creating the confidence that draws us all together into a reluctant nearly unconscious brotherhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wonder and plan my engines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the flags flutter the crowds cheer the legislatures meet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet it seems to me indeed at times that all this present commercial civilisation is no more than my poor uncles career writ large a swelling thinning bubble of assurances that its arithmetic is just as unsound its dividends as illadvised its ultimate aim as vague and forgotten that it all drifts on perhaps to some tremendous parallel to his individual disaster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well so it was we boomed and for four years and a half we lived a life of mingled substance and moonshine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until our particular unsoundness overtook us we went about in the most magnificent of motorcars upon tangible high roads made ourselves conspicuous and stately in splendid houses ate sumptuously and had a perpetual stream of notes and money trickling into our pockets hundreds of thousands of men and women respected us saluted us and gave us toil and honour i asked and my worksheets rose my aeroplanes swooped out of nothingness to scare the downland pewits my uncle waved his hand and lady grove and all its associations of chivalry and ancient peace were his waved again and architects were busy planning the great palace he never finished at crest hill and an army of folkmen gathered to do his bidding blue marble came from canada and timber from new zealand and beneath it all you know there was nothing but fictitious values as evanescent as rainbow gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pass the hardingham ever and again and glance aside through the great archway at the fountain and the ferns and think of those receding days when i was so near the centre of our eddy of greed and enterprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see again my uncles face white and intent and hear him discourse hear him make consciously napoleonic decisions grip his nettles put his finger on the spot bluff say snap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he became particularly addicted to the last idiom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards the end every conceivable act took the form of the odd fish that came to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and among others came gordonnasmyth that queer blend of romance and illegality who was destined to drag me into the most irrelevant adventure in my life the mordet island affair and leave me as they say with blood upon my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is remarkable how little it troubles my conscience and how much it stirs my imagination that particular memory of the life i took <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the story of mordet island has been told in a government report and told all wrong there are still excellent reasons for leaving it wrong in places but the liveliest appeals of discretion forbid my leaving it out altogether <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive still the vividest memory of gordonnasmyths appearance in the inner sanctum a lank sunburnt person in tweeds with a yellowbrown hatchet face and one faded blue eyethe other was a closed and sunken lidand how he told us with a stiff affectation of ease his incredible story of this great heap of quap that lay abandoned or undiscovered on the beach behind mordets island among white dead mangroves and the black ooze of brackish water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said my uncle on the fourth repetition of the word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they call it quap or quab or quabb said gordonnasmyth but our relations werent friendly enough to get the accent right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there the stuff is for the taking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got down to the damned place in a canoe alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to begin with gordonnasmyth was inclined to be dramatic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here he said when he first came in shutting the door rather carefully behind him as he spoke do you two menyes or nowant to put up six thousandfora clear good chance of were always getting chances like that said my uncle cocking his cigar offensively wiping his glasses and tilting his chair gordonnasmyths quick temper showed in a slight stiffening of his attitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you believe him said i getting up before he could reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre different and i know your books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were very glad youve come to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in heaps said my uncle softly with his glasses very oblique <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre only fit for the grocery said gordonnasmyth scornfully sitting down and helping himself to one of my uncles cigars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and first as to quap quap sir is the most radioactive stuff in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a festering mass of earths and heavy metals polonium radium ythorium thorium carium and new things too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they are mucked up together in a sort of rotting sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what it is how it got made i dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its like as if some young creator had been playing about there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there it lies in two heaps one small one great and the world for miles about it is blasted and scorched and dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can have it for the getting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his blue eye smiled at me and scrutinised me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he smoked and was fragmentary for a time fending off my questions then his story began to piece itself together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he conjured up a vision of this strange forgotten kink in the worlds littoral of the long meandering channels that spread and divaricate and spend their burden of mud and silt within the thunderbelt of atlantic surf of the dense tangled vegetation that creeps into the shimmering water with root and sucker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave a sense of heat and a perpetual reek of vegetable decay and told how at last comes a break among these things an arena fringed with bonewhite dead trees a sight of the hardblue sea line beyond the dazzling surf and a wide desolation of dirty shingle and mud bleached and scarred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little way off among charred dead weeds stands the abandoned stationabandoned because every man who stayed two months at that station stayed to die eaten up mysteriously like a leper with its dismantled sheds and its decaying pier of wormrotten and oblique piles and planks still insecurely possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the midst two clumsy heaps shaped like the backs of hogs one small one great sticking out under a rib of rock that cuts the space acrossquap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there it is said gordonnasmyth worth three pounds an ounce if its worth a penny two great heaps of it rotten stuff and soft ready to shovel and wheel and you may get it by the god knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a country where you mustnt trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a country where the company waits for good kind men to find it riches and then take em away from em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got to go and take it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theyre not great at catching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went into the particulars of that difficulty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wouldnt catch me because id sink first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me a yacht said but if you get caught said my uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am inclined to think gordonnasmyth imagined we would give him a cheque for six thousand pounds on the strength of his talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was very good talk but we didnt do that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stipulated for samples of his stuff for analysis and he consentedreluctantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think on the whole he would rather i didnt examine samples <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made a motion pocketwards that gave us an invincible persuasion that he had a sample upon him and that at the last instant he decided not to produce it prematurely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was evidently a curious strain of secretiveness in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he didnt like to give us samples and he wouldnt indicate within three hundred miles the position of this mordet island of his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had it clear in his mind that he had a secret of immense value and he had no idea at all of just how far he ought to go with business people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so presently to gain time for these hesitations of his he began to talk of other things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he talked of the dutch east indies and of the congo of portuguese east africa and paraguay of malays and rich chinese merchants dyaks and negroes and the spread of the mahometan world in africa today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all this time he was trying to judge if we were good enough to trust with his adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our cosy inner office became a little place and all our business cold and lifeless exploits beside his glimpses of strange minglings of men of slayings unavenged and curious customs of trade where no writs run and the dark treacheries of eastern ports and uncharted channels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had neither of us gone abroad except for a few vulgar raids on paris our world was england are the places of origin of half the raw material of the goods we sold had seemed to us as remote as fairyland or the forest of arden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but gordonnasmyth made it so real and intimate for us that afternoonfor me at any ratethat it seemed like something seen and forgotten and now again remembered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the end he produced his sample a little lump of muddy clay speckled with brownish grains in a glass bottle wrapped about with lead and flannelred flannel it was i remembera hue which is i know popularly supposed to double all the mystical efficacies of flannel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont carry it about on you said gordonnasmyth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it makes i took the stuff to thorold and thorold had the exquisite agony of discovering two new elements in what was then a confidential analysis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has christened them and published since but at the time gordonnasmyth wouldnt hear for a moment of our publication of any facts at all indeed he flew into a violent passion and abused me mercilessly even for showing the stuff to thorold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought you were going to analyse it yourself he said with the touching persuasion of the layman that a scientific man knows and practises at the sciences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made some commercial inquiries and there seemed even then much truth in gordonnasmyths estimate of the value of the stuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was before the days of caperns discovery of the value of canadium and his use of it in the capern filament but the cerium and thorium alone were worth the money he extracted for the gasmantles then in vogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what were the limits of the gasmantle trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much thorium not to speak of cerium could they take at a maximum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose that quantity was high enough to justify our shipload came doubts in another quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were the heaps up to sample <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were they as big as he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if these values held could we after all get the stuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see there were doubts of every grade and class in the way of this adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went some way nevertheless in the discussion of his project though i think we tried his patience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly he vanished from london and i saw no more of him for a year and a half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncle said that was what he had expected and when at last gordonnasmyth reappeared and mentioned in an incidental way that he had been to paraguay on private and we guessed passionate affairs the business of the quap expedition had to be begun again at the beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncle was disposed to be altogether sceptical but i wasnt so decided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i was drawn by its picturesque aspects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we neither of us dreamt of touching it seriously until caperns discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nasmyths story had laid hold of my imagination like one small intense picture of tropical sunshine hung on a wall of grey business affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i kept it going during gordonnasmyths intermittent appearances in england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every now and then he and i would meet and reinforce its effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we would lunch in london or he would cone to see my gliders at crest hill and make new projects for getting at those heaps again now with me now alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times they became a sort of fairystory with us an imaginative exercise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there came caperns discovery of what he called the ideal filament and with it an altogether less problematical quality about the business side of quap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the ideal filament needed five per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of canadium and canadium was known to the world only as a newly separated constituent of a variety of the rare mineral rutile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to thorold it was better known as an element in a mysterious sample brought to him by me and to me it was known as one of the elements in quap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told my uncle and we jumped on to the process at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found that gordonnasmyth still unaware of the altered value of the stuff and still thinking of the experimental prices of radium and the rarity value of cerium had got hold of a cousin named pollack made some extraordinary transaction about his life insurance policy and was buying a brig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we put in put down three thousand pounds and forthwith the life insurance transaction and the pollack side of this finance vanished into thin air leaving pollack i regret to say in the brig and in the secretexcept so far as canadium and the filament wentas residuum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we discussed earnestly whether we should charter a steamer or go on with the brig but we decided on the brig as a less conspicuous instrument for an enterprise that was after all to put it plainly stealing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that was one of our last enterprises before our great crisis and i will tell of it in its place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it was quap came into our affairs came in as a fairytale and became real <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more and more real it grew until at last it was real until at last i saw with my eyes the heaps my imagination had seen for so long and felt between my fingers again that halfgritty half soft texture of quap like sanded moistsugar one must feel it to understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all sorts of things came to the hardingham and offered themselves to my uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gordonnasmyth stands but only because he played a part at last in the crisis of our fortunes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so much came to us that it seemed to me at times as though the whole world of human affairs was ready to prostitute itself to our real and imaginary millions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i look back i am still dazzled and incredulous to think of the quality of our opportunities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we did the most extraordinary things things that it seems absurd to me to leave to any casual man of wealth and enterprise who cares to do them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had some amazing perceptions of just how modern thought and the supply of fact to the general mind may be controlled by money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among other things that my uncle offered for he tried very hard to buy the british medical journal and the lancet and run them on what he called modern lines and when they resisted him he talked very vigorously for a time of organising a rival enterprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was a very magnificent idea indeed in its way it would have given a tremendous advantage in the handling of innumerable specialties and indeed i scarcely know how far it would not have put the medical profession in our grip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it still amazes mei shall die amazedthat such a thing can be possible in the modern state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if my uncle failed to bring the thing off some one else may succeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i doubt even if he had got both these weeklies whether his peculiar style would have suited them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the change of purpose would have shown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have found it difficult to keep up their dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he certainly did not keep up the dignity of the sacred grove an important critical organ which he acquired one dayby saying snapfor eight hundred pounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got it lock stock and barrelunder one or other of which three aspects the editor was included <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even at that price it didnt pay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are a literary person you will remember the bright new cover he gave that representative organ of british intellectual culture and how his sound business instincts jarred with the exalted pretensions of a vanishing age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one old wrapper i discovered the weekly magazine of art philosophy science and belles lettres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you a nasty taste in your mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a drug but a live american remedy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hitherto unpublished letter from walter pater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a new catholic history of england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stage the paradox of acting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose it is some lingering traces of the bladesover tradition to me that makes this combination of letters and pills seem so incongruous just as i suppose it is a lingering trace of plutarch and my ineradicable boyish imagination that at bottom our state should be wise sane and dignified that makes me think a country which leaves its medical and literary criticism or indeed any such vitally important criticism entirely to private enterprise and open to the advances of any purchaser must be in a frankly hopeless condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are ideal conceptions of mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a matter of fact nothing would be more entirely natural and representative of the relations of learning thought and the economic situation in the world at the present time than this cover of the sacred grovethe quiet conservatism of the one element embedded in the aggressive brilliance of the other the contrasted notes of bold physiological experiment and extreme mental immobility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there comes back too among these hardingham memories an impression of a drizzling november day and how we looked out of the windows upon a procession of the london unemployed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like looking down a well into some momentarily revealed nether world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some thousands of needy ineffectual men had been raked together to trail their spiritless misery through the west eire with an appeal that was also in its way a weak and there they were halfphantom through the fog a silent footdragging interminable grey procession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they carried wet dirty banners they rattled boxes for pence these men who had not said snap in the right place the men who had snapped too eagerly the men who had never said snap the men who had never had a chance of saying snap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a shambling shameful stream they made oozing along the street the gutter waste of competitive civilisation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we stood high out of it all as high as if we looked godlike from another world standing in a room beautifully lit and furnished skillfully warmed filled with costly things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there thought i but for the grace of god go george and but my uncles thoughts ran in a different channel and he made that vision the test of a spirited but inconclusive harangue upon tariff reform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far my history of my aunt and uncle has dealt chiefly with his industrial and financial exploits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but side by side with that history of inflation from the infinitesimal to the immense is another development the change year by year from the shabby impecuniosity of the camden town lodging to the lavish munificence of the crest hill marble staircase and my aunts golden bed the bed that was facsimiled from fontainebleau <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the odd thing is that as i come to this nearer part of my story i find it much more difficult to tell than the clear little perspective memories of the earlier days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> impressions crowd upon one another and overlap one another i was presently to fall in love again to be seized by a passion to which i still faintly respond a passion that still clouds my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came and went between ealing and my aunt and uncle and presently between effie and clubland and then between business and a life of research that became far more continuous infinitely more consecutive and memorable than any of these other sets of experiences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt witness a regular social progress therefore my aunt and uncle went up in the world so far as i was concerned as if they were displayed by an early cinematograph with little jumps and flickers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i recall this side of our life the figure of my roundeyes buttonnosed pinkandwhite aunt susan tends always to the central position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we drove the car and sustained the car she sat in it with a magnificent variety of headgear poised upon her delicate neck and always with that faint ghost of a lisp no misspelling can rendercommented on and illuminated the new aspects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive already sketched the little home behind the wimblehurst chemists shop the lodging near the cobden statue and the apartments in gower street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thence my aunt and uncle went into a flat in redgauntlet mansions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they lived when i married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a compact flat with very little for a woman to do in it in those days my aunt i think used to find the time heavy upon her hands and so she took to books and reading and after a time even to going to lectures in the afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to find unexpected books upon her table sociological books travels shaws plays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said at the sight of some volume of the latter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im keeping a mind george she explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its been a tossup between setting up a mind and setting up a soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its jolly lucky for him and you its a mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive joined the london library and im going in for the royal institution and every blessed lecture that comes along next winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i remember her coming in late one evening with a notebook in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat down and took off her gloves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre just glass to me she sighed and then in a note of grave reproach you old package <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently they were setting up the house at beckengham and my aunt intermitted her intellectual activities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house at beckengham was something of an enterprise for them at that time a reasonably large place by the standards of the early years of tonobungay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a big rather gaunt villa with a conservatory and a shrubbery a tennislawn a quite considerable vegetable garden and a small disused coachhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had some glimpses of the excitements of its inauguration but not many because of the estrangement between my aunt and marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt went into that house with considerable zest and my uncle distinguished himself by the thoroughness with which he did the repainting and replumbing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had all the drains up and most of the garden with them and stood administrative on heapsadministrating whisky to the workmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found him there one day most napoleonic on a little elba of dirt in an atmosphere that defies print <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he also i remember chose what he considered cheerful contrasts of colours for the painting of the woodwork <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this exasperated my aunt extremelyshe called him a pestilential old splosher with an unusual note of earnestnessand he also enraged her into novelties of abuse by giving each bedroom the name of some favourite herocliff napoleon caesar and so forthand having it painted on the door in gilt letters on a black label <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin luther was kept for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only her respect for domestic discipline she said prevented her retaliating with old pondo on the housemaids cupboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he went and ordered one of the completest sets of garden requisites i have ever seenand had them all painted a hard clear blue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt got herself large tins of a kindlier hued enamel and had everything secretly recoated and this done she found great joy in the garden and became an ardent rose grower and herbaceous borderer leaving her mind indeed to damp evenings and the winter months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i think of her at beckenham i always think first of her as dressed in that blue cotton stuff she affected with her arms in huge gauntleted gardening gloves a trowel in one hand and a small but no doubt hardy and promising annual limp and very younglooking and sheepish in the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beckenham in the persons of a vicar a doctors wife and a large proud lady called hogberry called on my uncle and aunt almost at once so soon in fact as the lawn was down again and afterwards my aunt made friends with a quiet gentlewoman next door a propos of an overhanging cherry tree and the need of repairing the party fence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she resumed her place in society from which she had fallen with the disaster of wimblehurst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made a partially facetious study of the etiquette of her position had cards engraved and retaliated calls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then she received a card for one of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hogberrys at homes gave an old garden party herself participated in a bazaar and sale of work and was really becoming quite cheerfully entangled in beckenham society when she was suddenly taken up by the roots again by my uncle and transplanted to chiselhurst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old trek george she said compactly onward and up when i found her superintending the loading of two big furniture vans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go up and say goodbye to martin luther and then ill see i look into the jumbled stores of the middle distance of memory and beckenham seems to me a quite transitory phase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but really they were there several years through nearly all my married life in fact and far longer than the year and odd months we lived together at wimblehurst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the wimblehurst time with them is fuller in my memory by far then the beckenham period <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there comes back to me with a quite considerable amount of detail the effect of that garden party of my aunts and of a little social misbehaviour of which i was guilty on that occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its like a scrap from another life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all set in what is for me a kind of cutaneous feeling the feeling of rather illcut city clothes frock coat and grey trousers and of a high collar and tie worn in sunshine among flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have still a quite vivid memory of the little trapezoidal lawn of the gathering and particularly of the hats and feathers of the gathering of the parlourmaid and the blue teacups and of the magnificent presence of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hogberry and of her clear resonant voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a voice that would have gone with a garden party on a larger scale it went into adjacent premises it included the gardener who was far up the vegetable patch and technically out of play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only other men were my aunts doctor two of the clergy amiable contrasted men and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hogberrys imperfectly grownup son a youth just bursting into collar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest were women except for a young girl or so in a state of speechless good behaviour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marion and i had arrived a little estranged and i remember her as a silent presence a shadow across all that sunlit emptiness of intercourse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had embittered each other with one of those miserable little disputes that seemed so unavoidable between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had with the help of smithie dressed rather elaborately for the occasion and when she saw me prepared to accompany her in i think it was a grey suit she protested that silk hat and frock coat were imperative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was recalcitrant she quoted an illustrated paper showing a garden party with the king present and finally i capitulatedbut after my evil habit resentfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those old quarrels how pitiful they were how trivial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how sorrowful they are to recall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think they grow more sorrowful as i grow older and all the small passionate reasons for our mutual anger fade and fade out of memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the impression that beckenham company has left on my mind is one of a modest unreality they were all maintaining a front of unspecified social pretension and evading the display of the economic facts of the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the husbands were in business off stage it would have been outrageous to ask what the business wasand the wives were giving their energies to produce with the assistance of novels and the illustrated magazines a moralised version of the afternoon life of the aristocratic class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hadnt the intellectual or moral enterprise of the upperclass woman they had no political interests they had no views about anything and consequently they were i remember extremely difficult to talk to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they all sat about in the summerhouse and in gardenchairs and were very hatty and ruffley and sunshady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three ladies and the curate played croquet with a general immense gravity broken by occasional loud cries of feigned distress from the curate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dominant social fact that afternoon was mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hogberry she took up a certain position commanding the croquet and went on as my aunt said to me in an incidental aside like an old roundabout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she talked of the way in which beckenham society was getting mixed and turned on to a touching letter she had recently received from her former nurse at little gossdean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> followed a loud account of little gossdean and how much she and her eight sisters had been looked up to there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my poor mother was quite a little queen there she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people say the country labourers are getting disrespectful nowadays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt sonot if theyre properly treated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here of course in beckenham its different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont call the people we get here a poortheyre certainly not a proper poor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bugshoot theyre masses and ought to be treated as such <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mackridge floated through my mind as i listened to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was whirled on this roundabout for a bit and then had the fortune to fall off into a teteatete with a lady whom my aunt introduced as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mumblebut then she introduced everybody to me as mumble that afternoon either by way of humour or necessity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that must have been one of my earliest essays in the art of polite conversation and i remember that i began by criticising the local railway service and that at the third sentence or thereabouts mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mumble said in a distinctly bright and encouraging way that she feared i was a very frivolous person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what happened to end that conversation or if it had an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember talking to one of the clergy for a time rather awkwardly and being given a sort of topographical history of beckenham which he assured me time after time was quite an old place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as though i had treated it as new and he meant to be very patient but very convincing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we hung up in a distinct pause and my aunt rescued me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george she said in a confidential undertone keep the pot aboiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then audibly i say will you both old trot only too delighted to trot for you mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ponderevo said the clergyman becoming fearfully expert and in his elements only i found we were near a rustic table and that the housemaid was behind us in a suitable position to catch us on the rebound with the tea things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeated the clergyman to me much amused excellent expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i just saved him from the tray as he turned about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we handed tea for a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give em cakes said my aunt flushed but well in hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> always talk best after a little she surveyed the gathering with a predominant blue eye and helped herself to tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they keep on going stiff she said in an undertone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive its been a huge success i said encouragingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that boy has had his legs crossed in that position and hasnt spoken for ten minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes beginning a dry coughalways a bad sign george <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got myself involved with the gentlewoman from next door a pensive languidlooking little woman with a low voice and fell talking our topic cats and dogs and which it was we liked best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always feel said the pensive little woman that theres yes i found myself admitting with great enthusiasm there is something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know theres something about a cat too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it isnt the she glanced at me gravely and sighed a long deeply felt yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing seemed to me to amount to a stalemate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fear came into my heart and much perplexity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt like a drowning man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there seems to be something something i said helpfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sighed and said again very softly yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i looked at her and she was thinking dreamily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the drowning sensation returned the fear and enfeeblement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i perceived by a sort of inspiration that her teacup was empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me take your cup i said abruptly and that secured made for the table by the summerhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no intention then of deserting my aunt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but close at hand the big french window of the drawingroom yawned inviting and suggestive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can feel all that temptation now and particularly the provocation of my collar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant i was lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dashed in put down the cup on the keys of the grand piano and fled upstairs softly swiftly three steps at a time to the sanctuary of my uncles study his snuggery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i arrived there breathless convinced there was no return for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was very glad and ashamed of myself and desperate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by means of a penknife i contrived to break open his cabinet of cigars drew a chair to the window took off my coat collar and tie and remained smoking guiltily and rebelliously and peeping through the blind at the assembly on the lawn until it was altogether gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clergymen i thought were wonderful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few such pictures of those early days at beckenham stand out and then i find myself among the chiselhurst memories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chiselhurst mansion had grounds rather than a mere garden and there was a gardeners cottage and a little lodge at the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ascendant movement was always far more in evidence there than one night picks itself out as typical as in its way marking an epoch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was there i think about some advertisement stuff on some sort of business anyhow and my uncle and aunt had come back in a fly from a dinner at the runcorns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even there he was nibbling at runcorn with the idea of our great amalgamation budding in his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got down there i suppose about eleven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found the two of them sitting in the study my aunt on a chairarm with a whimsical pensiveness on her face regarding my uncle and he much extended and very rotund in the low armchair drawn up to the fender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here george said my uncle after my first greetings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one never knows where to have him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ate too much of that fishy stuff at first like salt frog spawn and was a bit confused by olives andwell i didnt know which wine was which <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had to say that each time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it puts your talk all wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she wasnt in evening dress not like the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we we got to do it all better said my uncle we got to do it in style <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tries to pass it off as humorousmy aunt pulled a grimace it isnt humorous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were on the upgrade now fair and square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to be nobody isnt going to laugh at me said my uncle glancing at his contours and suddenly sitting up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my aunt raised her eyebrows slightly swung her foot and said nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we arent keeping pace with our own progress george <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were bumping against new people and they set up to be gentlefolksetiquette dinners and all the rest of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they give themselves airs and expect us to be fishoutofwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well we give them style for our advertisements and were going to give em style all through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you neednt be born to it to dance well on runcorn hadnt cigars like these he said truncating one my aunt and i regarded him full of apprehensions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got idees he said darkly to the cigar deepening our dread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pocketed his cigarcutter and spoke again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got to learn all the rotten little game first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see frinstance we got to get samples of all the blessed wines there areand learn em up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stern smoor burgundy all of em <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took stern tonightand when she tasted it firstyou pulled a face susan you did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got to get used to wine and not do that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got to get used to wearing evening dressyou susan too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> always have had a tendency to stick out of my clothes said my aunt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had never seen my uncle so immensely serious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got to get the hang of etiquette he went on to the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dine every night in evening dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> learn up golf and tennis and things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made it isnt only freedom from gawshery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just all right and one better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what i call he mumbled his cigar and smoked for a space leaning forward and looking into the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is it he asked after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tips about eating tips about drinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how to hold yourself and not say jes the few little things they know for certain are he was silent again and the cigar crept up from the horizontal towards the zenith as the confidence of his mouth increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> learn the whole bag of tricks in six months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> george you in particular ought to get hold of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ought to get into a good always ready to learn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever since you gave me the chance of latin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far we dont seem to have hit upon any weve come to french said my aunt anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a very useful language said my uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for accent no englishman has an accent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a bluff.its all a bluff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why its so important susan for us to attend to style <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these cigars are good for the mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think of it all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not going to be beat by these what do you think of it george <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i said i thought of it i dont now recall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only i have very distinctly the impression of meeting for a moment my aunts impenetrable eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and anyhow he started in with his accustomed energy to rape the mysteries of the costly life and become the calmest of its lords <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the whole i think he did itthoroughly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have crowded memories a little difficult to disentangle of his experimental stages his experimental proceedings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its hard at times to say which memory comes in front of which <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i recall him as presenting on the whole a series of small surprises as being again and again unexpectedly a little more selfconfident a little more polished a little richer and finer a little more aware of the positions and values of things and men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on that coast is a fair castle that men call florach and it is right a strong place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and uppermore amongst the mountains is a fair city that is called tarsus and the city of longemaath and the city of assere and the city of marmistre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when a man is passed those mountains and those fells he goes by the city of marioch and by artoise where is a great bridge upon the river of ferne that is called farfar and it is a great river bearing ships and it runs right fast out of the mountains to the city of damascus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beside the city of damascus is another great river that comes from the hills of liban which men call abbana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the passing of this river saint eustace that sometime was called placidas lost his wife and his two children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this river runs through the plain of archades and so to the red sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from thence men go to the city of phenice where are hot wells and hot baths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then men go to the city of ferne and between phenice and ferne are ten mile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there are many fair woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then men come to antioch which is ten mile thence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it is a fair city and well walled about with many fair towers and it is a great city but it was sometime greater than it is now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it was sometime two mile on length and on breadth other half mile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and through the midst of that city ran the water of farphar and a great bridge over it and there was sometime in the walls about this city three hundred and fifty towers and at each pillar of the bridge was a stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the chief city of the kingdom of syria <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ten mile from this city is the port of saint symeon and there goes the water of farphar into the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from antioch men go to a city that is called lacuth and then to gebel and then to tortouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there near is the land of channel and there is a strong castle that is called maubek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from tortouse pass men to tripoli by sea or else by land through the straits of mountains and fells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there is a city that is called gibilet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from tripoli go men to acres and from thence are two ways to jerusalem the one on the left half and the other on the right half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the left way men go by damascus and by the flum jordan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the right way men go by maryn and by the land of flagramy and near the mountains into the city of cayphas that some men call the castle of pilgrims <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from thence to jerusalem are three day journey in the which men shall go through caesarea philippi and so to jaffa and rames and the castle of emmaus and so to jerusalem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now have i told you some ways by land and by water that men may go by to the holy land after the countries that they come from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless they come all to one end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet is there another way to jerusalem all by land and pass not the sea from france or flanders but that way is full long and perilous and of great travel and therefore few go that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he that shall go that way he shall go through almayne and prussia and so to tartary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this tartary is holden of the great caan of cathay of whom i think to speak afterward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a full ill land and sandy and little fruit bearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for there grows no corn ne wine ne beans ne peas ne none other fruit convenable to man for to live with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there are beasts in great plenty and therefore they eat but flesh without bread and sup the broth and they drink milk of all manner of beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they eat hounds cats ratons and all other wild beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they have no wood or else little and therefore they warm and seethe their meat with horsedung and cowdung and of other beasts dried against the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and princes and other eat not but once in the day and that but little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be right foul folk and of evil kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in summer by all the countries fall many tempests and many hideous thunders and leits and slay much people and beasts also full oftentime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and suddenly is there passing heat and suddenly also passing cold and it is the foulest country and the most cursed and the poorest that men know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and their prince that governeth that country that they clepe batho dwelleth at the city of orda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and truly no good man should not dwell in that country for the land and the country is not worthy hounds to dwell in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it were a good country to sow in thistle and briars and broom and thorns and briars and for no other thing is it not good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> natheles there is good land in some place but it is pure little as men say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not been in that country nor by those ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have been at other lands that march to those countries as in the land of russia as in the land of nyflan and in the realm of cracow and of letto and in the realm of daristan and in many other places that march to the coasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i went never by that way to jerusalem wherefore i may not well tell you the manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if this matter please to any worthy man that hath gone by that way he may tell it if him like to that intent that those that will go by that way and make their voyage by those coasts may know what way is there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for no man may pass by that way goodly but in time of winter for the perilous waters and wicked mareys that be in those countries that no man may pass but if it be strong frost and snow above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if the snow ne were not men might not go upon the ice ne horse ne car neither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it is well a three journeys of such way to pass from prussia to the land of saracens habitable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it behoveth to the christian men that shall war against them every year to bear their victuals with them for they shall find there no good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then must they let carry their victual upon the ice with cars that have no wheels that they clepe sleighs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as long as their victuals last they may abide there but no longer for there shall they find no wight that will sell them any victual or anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the spies see any christian men come upon them they run to the towns and cry with a loud voice kerra kerra kerra <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then anon they arm them and assemble them together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ye shall understand that it freezeth more strongly in those countries than on this half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore hath every man stews in his house and in those stews they eat and do their occupations all that they may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for that is at the north parts that men clepe the septentrional where it is all only cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the sun is but little or none toward those countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore in the septentrion that is very north is the land so cold that no man may dwell there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the contrary toward the south it is so hot that no man ne may dwell there because that the sun when he is upon the south casteth his beams all straight upon that part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the customs of saracens and of their law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how the soldan now because that i have spoken of saracens and of their country now if ye will know a part of their law and of their belief i shall tell you after that their book that is clept alkaron telleth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some men clepe that book meshaf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some men clepe it harme after the diverse languages of the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the which book mohammet took them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the which book among other things is written as i have oftentime seen and read that the good shall go to paradise and the evil to hell and that believe all saracens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if a man ask them what paradise they mean they say to paradise that is a place of delights where men shall find all manner of fruits in all seasons and rivers running of milk and honey and of wine and of sweet water and that they shall have fair houses and noble every man after his desert made of precious stones and of gold and of silver and that every man shall have four score wives all maidens and he shall have ado every day with them and yet he shall find them always maidens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also they believe and speak gladly of the virgin mary and of the incarnation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say that mary was taught of the angel and that gabriel said to her that she was forchosen from the beginning of the world and that he shewed to her the incarnation of jesu christ and that she conceived and bare child maiden and that witnesseth their book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say also that jesu christ spake as soon as he was born and that he was an holy prophet and a true in word and deed and meek and piteous and rightful and without any vice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say also that when the angel shewed the incarnation of christ unto mary she was young and had great dread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for there was then an enchanter in the country that dealt with witchcraft that men clept taknia that by his enchantments could make him in likeness of an angel and went oftentimes and lay with maidens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore mary dreaded lest it had been taknia that came for to deceive the maidens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore she conjured the angel that he should tell her if it were he or no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the angel answered and said that she should have no dread of him for he was very messenger of jesu christ <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also their book saith that when that she had childed under a palm tree she had great shame that she had a child and she greet and said that she would that she had been dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and anon the child spake to her and comforted her and said mother ne dismay thee nought for god hath hid in thee his privities for the salvation of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in other many places saith their alkaron that jesu christ spake as soon as he was born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that book saith also that jesu was sent from god almighty for to be mirror and example and token to all men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the alkaron saith also of the day of doom how god shall come to doom all manner of folk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the good he shall draw on his side and put them into bliss and the wicked he shall condemn to the pains of hell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and among all prophets jesu was the most excellent and the most worthy next god and that he made the gospels in the which is good doctrine and healthful full of clarity and soothfastness and true preaching to them that believe in god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that he was a very prophet and more than a prophet and lived without sin and gave sight to the blind and healed the lepers and raised dead men and styed to heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when they may hold the book of the gospels of our lord written and namely missus est angelus gabriel that gospel they say those that be lettered oftentimes in their orisons and they kiss it and worship it with great devotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they fast an whole month in the year and eat nought but by night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they keep them from their wives all that month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the sick men be not constrained to that fast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also this book speaketh of jews and saith that they be cursed for they would not believe that jesu christ was come of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that they lied falsely on mary and on her son jesu christ saying that they had crucified jesu the son of mary for he was never crucified as they say but that god made him to sty up to him without death and without annoy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he transfigured his likeness into judas iscariot and him crucified the jews and weened that it had been jesus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but jesus styed to heavens all quick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore they say that the christian men err and have no good knowledge of this and that they believe folily and falsely that jesu christ was crucified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say yet that and he had been crucified that god had done against his righteousness for to suffer jesu christ that was innocent to be put upon the cross without guilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in this article they say that we fail and that the great righteousness of god might not suffer so great a wrong and in this faileth their faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for they knowledge well that the works of jesu christ be good and his words and his deeds and his doctrine by his gospels were true and his miracles also true and the blessed virgin mary is good and holy maiden before and after the birth of jesu christ and that all those that believe perfectly in god shall be saved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and because that they go so nigh our faith they be lightly converted to christian law when men preach them and shew them distinctly the law of jesu christ and when they tell them of the prophecies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also they say that they know well by the prophecies that the law of mahomet shall fail as the law of the jews did and that the law of christian people shall last to the day of doom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if any man ask them what is their belief they answer thus and in this form we believe god former of heaven and of earth and of all other things that he made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and without him is nothing made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we believe of the day of doom and that every man shall have his merit after he hath deserved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we believe it for sooth all that god hath said by the mouths of his prophets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also mahomet commanded in his alkaron that every man should have two wives or three or four but now they take unto nine and of lemans as many as he may sustain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if any of their wives mis bear them against their husband he may cast her out of his house and depart from her and take another but he shall depart with her his goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also when men speak to them of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost they say that they be three persons but not one god for their alkaron speaketh not of the trinity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they say well that god hath speech and else were he dumb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and god hath also a spirit they know well for else they say he were not alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when men speak to them of the incarnation how that by the word of the angel god sent his wisdom in to earth and enombred him in the virgin mary and by the word of god shall the dead be raised at the day of doom they say that it is sooth and that the word of god hath great strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say that whoso knew not the word of god he should not know god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say also that jesu christ is the word of god and so saith their alkaron where it saith that the angel spake to mary and said mary god shall preach thee the gospel by the word of his mouth and his name shall be clept jesu christ <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say also that abraham was friend to god and that moses was familiar speaker with god and jesu christ was the word and the spirit of god and that mohammet was right messenger of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say that of these four jesu was the most worthy and the most excellent and the most great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that they have many good articles of our faith albeit that they have no perfect law and faith as christian men have and therefore be they lightly converted and namely those that understand the scriptures and the prophecies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for they have the gospels and the prophecies and the bible written in their language wherefore they ken much of holy writ but they understand it not but after the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so do the jews for they understand not the letter ghostly but bodily and therefore be they reproved of the wise that ghostly understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore saith saint paul litera occidit spiritus autem vivificat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also the saracens say that the jews be cursed for they have befouled the law that god sent them by moses and the christian be cursed also as they say for they keep not the commandments and the precepts of the gospel that jesu christ taught them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore i shall tell you what the soldan told me upon a day in his chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he let void out of his chamber all manner of men lords and others for he would speak with me in counsel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there he asked me how the christian men governed them in our country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i said him right well thanked be god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he said me truly nay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for ye christian men reck right nought how untruly to serve god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye should give ensample to the lewd people for to do well and ye give them ensample to do evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the commons upon festival days when they should go to church to serve god then go they to taverns and be there in gluttony all the day and all night and eat and drink as beasts that have no reason and wit not when they have enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also the christian men enforce themselves in all manners that they may for to fight and for to deceive that one that other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therewithal they be so proud that they know not how to be clothed now long now short now strait now large now sworded now daggered and in all manner guises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they should be simple meek and true and full of alms deeds as jesu was in whom they trow but they be all the contrary and ever inclined to the evil and to do evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be so covetous that for a little silver they sell their daughters their sisters and their own wives to put them to lechery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and one withdraweth the wife of another and none of them holdeth faith to another but they defoul their law that jesu christ betook them to keep for their salvation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thus for their sins have they lost all this land that we hold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for for their sins their god hath taken them into our hands not only by strength of ourself but for their sins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for we know well in very sooth that when ye serve god god will help you and when he is with you no man may be against you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that know we well by our prophecies that christian men shall win again this land out of our hands when they serve god more devoutly but as long as they be of foul and of unclean living as they be now we have no dread of them in no kind for their god will not help them in no wise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i asked him how he knew the state of christian men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he answered me that he knew all the state of all courts of christian kings and princes and the state of the commons also by his messengers that he sent to all lands in manner as they were merchants of precious stones of cloths of gold and of other things for to know the manner of every country amongst christian men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he let clepe in all the lords that he made void first out of his chamber and there he shewed me four that were great lords in the country that told me of my country and of many other christian countries as well as they had been of the same country and they spake french right well and the soldan also whereof i had great marvel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it is great slander to our faith and to our law when folk that be without law shall reprove us and undernim us of our sins and they that should be converted to christ and to the law of jesu by our good ensamples and by our acceptable life to god and so converted to the law of jesu christ be through our wickedness and evil living far from us and strangers from the holy and very belief shall thus appeal us and hold us for wicked livers and cursed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and truly they say sooth for the saracens be good and faithful for they keep entirely the commandment of the holy book alkaron that god sent them by his messenger mahomet to the which as they say saint gabriel the angel oftentime told the will of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ye shall understand that mahomet was born in arabia that was first a poor knave that kept camels that went with merchants for merchandise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so befell that he went with the merchants into egypt and they were then christian in those parts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at the deserts of arabia he went into a chapel where a hermit dwelt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he entered into the chapel that was but a little and a low thing and had but a little door and a low then the entry began to wax so great and so large and so high as though it had been of a great minster or the gate of a palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this was the first miracle the saracens say that mahomet did in his youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after began he for to wax wise and rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he was a great astronomer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after he was governor and prince of the land of cozrodane and he governed it full wisely in such manner that when the prince was dead he took the lady to wife that hight gadrige <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mahomet fell often in the great sickness that men call the falling evil wherefore the lady was full sorry that ever she took him to husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mahomet made her to believe that all times when he fell so gabriel the angel came for to speak with him and for the great light and brightness of the angel he might not sustain him from falling and therefore the saracens say that gabriel came often to speak with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this mahomet reigned in arabia the year of our lord jesu christ and was of the generation of ishmael that was abrahams son that he gat upon hagar his chamberer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore there be saracens that be clept ishmaelites and some hagarenes of hagar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the other properly be clept saracens of sarah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some be clept moabites and some ammonites for the two sons of lot moab and ammon that he begat on his daughters that were afterward great earthly princes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also mahomet loved well a good hermit that dwelled in the deserts a mile from mount sinai in the way that men go from arabia toward chaldea and toward ind one days journey from the sea where the merchants of venice come often for merchandise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so often went mahomet to this hermit that all his men were wroth for he would gladly hear this hermit preach and make his men wake all night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore his men thought to put the hermit to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it befell upon a night that mahomet was drunken of good wine and he fell on sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and his men took mahomets sword out of his sheath whiles he slept and therewith they slew this hermit and put his sword all bloody in his sheath again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at morrow when he found the hermit dead he was full sorry and wroth and would have done his men to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they all with one accord said that he himself had slain him when he was drunken and shewed him his sword all bloody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he trowed that they had said sooth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he cursed the wine and all those that drink it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore saracens that be devout drink never no wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but some drink it privily for if they drunk it openly they should be reproved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they drink good beverage and sweet and nourishing that is made of gallamelle and that is that men make sugar of that is of right good savour and it is good for the breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also it befalleth sometime that christian men become saracens either for poverty or for simpleness or else for their own wickedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore the archflamen or the flamen as our archbishop or bishop when he receiveth them saith thus la ellec olla sila machomete rores alla that is to say there is no god now i have told you a part of their law and of their customs i shall say you of their letters that they have with their names and the manner of their figures what they be almoy bethath cathi ephoti delphoi fothi garothi hechum iotty kaythi lothum malach nabaloth orthi chesiri ch ruth holath routhi salathi thatimus yrthom aath arrocchi tipyn ichetus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and these be the names of their a <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now shall ye know the figures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and four letters they have more than other for diversity of their language and speech forasmuch as they speak in their throats and we in england have in our language and speech two letters more than they have in their a <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that is character which cannot be reproduced and character which cannot be reproduced which be clept thorn and gh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the lands of albania and of libia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the wishings for watching now sith i have told you before of the holy land and of that country about and of many ways for to go to that land and to the mount sinai and of babylon the more and the less and to other places that i have spoken before now is time if it like you for to tell you of the marches and isles and diverse beasts and of diverse folk beyond these marches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for in those countries beyond be many diverse countries and many great kingdoms that be departed by the four floods that come from paradise terrestrial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for mesopotamia and the kingdom of chaldea and arabia be between the two rivers of tigris and of euphrates and the kingdom of media and of persia be between the rivers of nile and of tigris and the kingdom of syria whereof i have spoken before and palestine and phoenicia be between euphrates and the sea mediterranean the which sea dureth in length from morocco upon the sea of spain unto the great sea so that it lasteth beyond constantinople miles of lombardy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and toward the sea ocean in ind is the kingdom of scythia that is all closed with hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after under scythia and from the sea of caspian unto the flom of thainy is amazonia that is the land of feminye where that no man is but only all women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after is albania a full great realm and it is clept albania because that the folk be whiter there than in other marches thereabout and in that country be so great hounds and so strong that they assail lions and slay them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then after is hircania bactria hiberia and many other kingdoms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and between the red sea and the sea ocean toward the south is the kingdom of ethiopia and of lybia the higher the which land of lybia that is to say lybia the low that beginneth at the sea of spain from thence where the pillars of hercules be and endureth unto anent egypt and toward ethiopia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that country of lybia is the sea more high than the land and it seemeth that it would cover the earth and natheles yet it passeth not his marks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men see in that country a mountain to the which no man cometh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this land of lybia whoso turneth toward the east the shadow of himself is on the right side and here in our country the shadow is on the left side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that sea of lybia is no fish for they may not live ne dure for the great heat of the sun because that the water is evermore boiling for the great heat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and many other lands there be that it were too long to tell or to number <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of some parts i shall speak more plainly hereafter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whoso will then go toward tartary toward persia toward chaldea and toward ind he must enter the sea at genoa or at venice or at some other haven that i have told you before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then pass men the sea and arrive at trebizond that is a good city and it was wont to be the haven of pontus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is the haven of persians and of medians and of the marches there beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that city lieth saint athanasius that was bishop of alexandria that made the psalm quicunque vult <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this athanasius was a great doctor of divinity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and because that he preached and spake so deeply of divinity and of the godhead he was accused to the pope of rome that he was an heretic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore the pope sent after him and put him in prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and whiles he was in prison he made that psalm and sent it to the pope and said that if he were an heretic then was that heresy for that he said was his belief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the pope saw it and had examined it that it was perfect and good and verily our faith and our belief he made him to be delivered out of prison and commanded that psalm to be said every day at prime and so he held athanasius a good man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he would never go to his bishopric again because that they accused him of heresy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trebizond was wont to be holden of the emperor of constantinople but a great man that he sent for to keep the country against the turks usurped the land and held it to himself and cleped him emperor of trebizond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from thence men go through little armenia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in that country is an old castle that stands upon a rock the which is clept the castle of the sparrowhawk that is beyond the city of layays beside the town of pharsipee that belongeth to the lordship of cruk that is a rich lord and a good christian man where men find a sparrowhawk upon a perch right fair and right well made and a fair lady of faerie that keepeth it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and who that will watch that sparrowhawk seven days and seven nights and as some men say three days and three nights without company and without sleep that fair lady shall give him when he hath done the first wish that he will wish of earthly things and that hath been proved oftentimes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and one time befell that a king of armenia that was a worthy knight and doughty man and a noble princes watched that hawk some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at the end of seven days and seven nights the lady came to him and bade him wish for he had well deserved it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he answered that he was great lord enough and well in peace and had enough of worldly riches and therefore he would wish none other thing but the body of that fair lady to have it at his will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she answered him that he knew not what he asked and said that he was a fool to desire that he might not have for she said that he should not ask but earthly thing for she was none earthly thing but a ghostly thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the king said that he ne would ask none other thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the lady answered sith that i may not withdraw you from your lewd corage i shall give you without wishing and to all them that shall come of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye shall have war without peace and always to the nine degree ye shall be in subjection of your enemies and ye shall be needy of all goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and never since neither the king of armenia nor the country were never in peace ne they had never sith plenty of goods and they have been sithen always under tribute of the saracens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also the son of a poor man watched that hawk and wished that he might chieve well and to be happy to merchandise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he became the most rich and the most famous merchant that might be on sea or on earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he became so rich that he knew not the thousand part of that he had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he was wiser in wishing than was the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also a knight of the temple watched there and wished a purse evermore full of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she said him that he had asked the destruction of their order for the trust and the affiance of that purse and for the great pride that they should have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore look he keep him well that shall wake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if he sleep he is lost that never man shall see him more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is not the right way for to go to the parts that i have named before but for to see the marvel that i have spoken of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore whoso will go right way men go from trebizond toward armenia the great unto a city that is clept erzeroum that was wont to be a good city and a plenteous but the turks have greatly wasted it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereabout groweth no wine nor fruit but little or else none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this land is the earth more high than in any other and that maketh great cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there be many good waters and good wells that come under earth from the flom of paradise that is clept euphrates that is a journey beside that city and that river cometh towards ind under earth and resorteth into the land of altazar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so pass men by this armenia and enter the sea of persia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that city of erzeroum go men to an hill that is clept sabissocolle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there beside is another hill that men clepe ararat but the jews clepe it taneez where noahs ship rested and yet is upon that mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men may see it afar in clear weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that mountain is well a seven mile high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some men say that they have seen and touched the ship and put their fingers in the parts where the fiend went out when that noah said benedicite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they that say such words say their will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a man may not go up the mountain for great plenty of snow that is always on that mountain neither summer nor winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that no man may go up there ne never man did since the time of noah save a monk that by the grace of god brought one of the planks down that yet is in the minster at the foot of the mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beside is the city of dain that noah founded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and fast by is the city of any in the which were wont to be a thousand churches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but upon that mountain to go up this monk had great desire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so upon a day he went up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he was upward the three part of the mountain he was so weary that he might no further and so he rested him and fell asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he awoke he found himself lying at the foot of the mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he prayed devoutly to god that he would vouchsafe to suffer him go up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and an angel came to him and said that he should go up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and sith that time never none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore men should not believe such words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that mountain go men to the city of thauriso that was wont to be clept taxis that is a full fair city and a great and one of the best that is in the world for merchandise thither come all merchants for to buy avoirdupois and it is in the land of the emperor of persia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men say that the emperor taketh more good in that city for custom of merchandise than doth the richest christian king of all his realm that liveth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the toll and the custom of his merchants is without estimation to be numbered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside that city is a hill of salt and of that salt every man taketh what he will for to salt with to his need <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there dwell many christian men under tribute of saracens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from that city men pass by many towns and castles in going toward ind unto the city of sadonia that is a ten journeys from thauriso and it is a full noble city and a great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there dwelleth the emperor of persia in summer for the country is cold enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there be good rivers bearing ships <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after go men the way toward ind by many journeys and by many countries unto the city that is clept cassak and that is a full noble city and a plenteous of corns and wines and of all other goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the city where the three kings met together when they went to seek our lord in bethlehem to worship him and to present him with gold incense and myrrh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it is from that city to bethlehem fiftythree journeys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that city men go to another city that is clept gethe that is a journey from the sea that men clepe the gravelly sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the best city that the emperor of persia hath in all his land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they clepe flesh there dabago and the wine vapa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the paynims say that no christian man may not long dwell ne endure with the life in that city but die within short time and no man knoweth not the cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after go men by many cities and towns and great countries that it were too long to tell unto the city of cornaa that was wont to be so great that the walls about hold twentyfive mile about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the walls shew yet but it is not all inhabited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from cornaa go men by many lands and many cities and towns unto the land of job <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there endeth the land of the emperor of persia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if ye will know the letters of persians and what names they have they be such as i last devised you but not in sounding of their words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the land of job and of his age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the array of men of chaldea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the land where women dwell without company of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of after the departing from cornaa men enter into the land of job that is a full fair country and a plenteous of all goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men clepe that land the land of susiana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land is the city of theman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> job was a paynim and he was aram of gosre his son and held that land as prince of that country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he was so rich that he knew not the hundred part of his goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and although he were a paynim nevertheless he served well god after his law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and our lord took his service to his pleasane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he fell in poverty he was seventyeight year of age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after when god had proved his patience and that it was so great he brought him again to riches and to higher estate than he was before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after that he was king of idumea after king esau and when he was king he was clept jobab <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in that kingdom he lived after year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so he was of age when he died year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land of job there ne is no default of no thing that is needful to mans body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there be hills where men get great plenty of manna in greater abundance than in any other country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this manna is clept bread of angels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it is a white thing that is full sweet and right delicious and more sweet than honey or sugar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it cometh of the dew of heaven that falleth upon the herbs in that country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it congealeth and becometh all white and sweet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men put it in medicines for rich men to make the womb lax and to purge evil blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it cleanseth the blood and putteth out melancholy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this land of job marcheth to the kingdom of chaldea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this land of chaldea is full great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the language of that country is more great in sounding than it is in other parts of the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men pass to go beyond by the tower of babylon the great of the which i have told you before where that all the languages were first changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that is a four journeys from chaldea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that realm be fair men and they go full nobly arrayed in clothes of gold orfrayed and apparelled with great pearls and precious stones full nobly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the women be right foul and evil arrayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they go all barefoot and clothed in evil garments large and wide but they be short to the knees and long sleeves down to the feet like a monks frock and their sleeves be hanging about their shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be black women foul and hideous and truly as foul as they be as evil they be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that kingdom of chaldea in a city that is clept ur dwelled terah abrahams father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that was in that time that ninus was king of babylon of arabia and of egypt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this ninus made the city of nineveh the which that noah had begun before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and because that ninus performed it he cleped it nineveh after his own name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there lieth tobit the prophet of whom holy writ speaketh of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from that city of ur abraham departed by the commandment of god from thence after the death of his father and led with him sarah his wife and lot his brothers son because that he had no child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they went to dwell in the land of canaan in a place that is clept shechem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this lot was he that was saved when sodom and gomorrah and the other cities were burnt and sunken down to hell where that the dead sea is now as i have told you before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land of chaldea they have their proper languages and their proper letters such as ye may see hereafter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside the land of chaldea is the land of amazonia that is the land of feminye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in that realm is all women and no man not as some men say that men may not live there but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for sometime there was a king in that country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men married as in other countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so befell that the king had war with them of scythia the which king hight colopeus that was slain in battle and all the good blood of his realm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the queen and all the other noble ladies saw that they were all widows and that all the royal blood was lost they armed them and as creatures out of wit they slew all the men of the country that were left for they would that all the women were widows as the queen and they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from that time hitherwards they never would suffer man to dwell amongst them longer than seven days and seven nights ne that no child that were male should dwell amongst them longer than he were nourished and then sent to his father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when they will have any company of man then they draw them towards the lands marching next to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they have loves that use them and they dwell with them an eight days or ten and then go home again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if they have any knave child they keep it a certain time and then send it to the father when he can go alone and eat by himself or else they slay it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if it be a female they do away that one pap with an hot iron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if it be a woman of great lineage they do away the left pap that they may the better bear a shield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if it be a woman on foot they do away the right pap for to shoot with bow turkeys for they shoot well with bows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land they have a queen that governeth all that land and all they be obeissant to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and always they make her queen by election that is most worthy in arms for they be right good warriors and orped and wise noble and worthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they go oftentime in solde to help of other kings in their wars for gold and silver as other soldiers do and they maintain themselves right vigourously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this land of amazonia is an isle all environed with the sea save in two places where be two entries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beyond that water dwell the men that be their paramours and their loves where they go to solace them when they will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside amazonia is the land of tarmegyte that is a great country and a full delectable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for the goodness of the country king alexander let first make there the city of alexandria and yet he made twelve cities of the same name but that city is now clept celsite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from that other coast of chaldea toward the south is ethiopia a great country that stretcheth to the end of egypt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ethiopia is departed in two parts principal and that is in the east part and in the meridional part the which part meridional is clept mauritania and the folk of that country be black enough and more black than in the tother part and they be clept moors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that part is a well that in the day it is so cold that no man may drink thereof and in the night it is so hot that no man may suffer his hand therein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beyond that part toward the south to pass by the sea ocean is a great land and a great country but men may not dwell there for the fervent burning of the sun so is it passing hot in that country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia all the rivers and all the waters be trouble and they be somedeal salt for the great heat that is there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the folk of that country be lightly drunken and have but little appetite to meat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they have commonly the flux of the womb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia be many diverse folk and ethiope is clept cusis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that country be folk that have but one foot and they go so blyve that it is marvel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the foot is so large that it shadoweth all the body against the sun when they will lie and rest them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia when the children be young and little they be all yellow and when that they wax of age that yellowness turneth to be all black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia is the city of saba and the land of the which one of the three kings that presented our lord in bethlehem was king of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from ethiopia men go into ind by many diverse countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men clepe the high ind emlak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ind is divided in three principal parts that is the more that is a full hot country and ind the less that is a full attempre country that stretcheth to the land of media and the three part toward the septentrion is full cold so that for pure cold and continual frost the water becometh crystal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and upon those rocks of crystal grow the good diamonds that be of trouble colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yellow crystal draweth colour like oil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be so hard that no man may polish them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men clepe them diamonds in that country and hamese in another country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other diamonds men find in arabia that be not so good and they be more brown and more tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and other diamonds also men find in the isle of cyprus that be yet more tender and them men may well polish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the land of macedonia men find diamonds also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the best and the most precious be in ind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men find many times hard diamonds in a mass that cometh out of gold when men pure it and refine it out of the mine when men break that mass in small pieces and sometime it happens that men find some as great as a peas and some less and they be as hard as those of ind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and albeit that men find good diamonds in ind yet nevertheless men find them more commonly upon the rocks in the sea and upon hills where the mine of gold is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they grow many together one little another great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there be some of the greatness of a bean and some as great as an hazel nut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be square and pointed of their own kind both above and beneath without working of mans hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they grow together male and female <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be nourished with the dew of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they engender commonly and bring forth small children that multiply and grow all the year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have oftentimes assayed that if a man keep them with a little of the rock and wet them with maydew oftsithes they shall grow every year and the small will wax great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for right as the fine pearl congealeth and waxeth great of the dew of heaven right so doth the very diamond and right as the pearl of his own kind taketh roundness right so the diamond by virtue of god taketh squareness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men shall bear the diamond on his left side for it is of greater virtue then than on the right side for the strength of their growing is toward the north that is the left side of the world and the left part of man is when he turneth his face toward the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you like to know the virtues of the diamond as men may find in the lapidary that many men know not i shall tell you as they beyond the sea say and affirm of whom all science and all philosophy cometh from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he that beareth the diamond upon him it giveth him hardiness and manhood and it keepeth the limbs of his body whole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it giveth him victory of his enemies in plea and in war if his cause be rightful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it keepeth him that beareth it in good wit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it keepeth him from strife and riot from evil swevens from sorrows and from enchantments and from fantasies and illusions of wicked spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if any cursed witch or enchanter would bewitch him that beareth the diamond all that sorrow and mischance shall turn to himself through virtue of that stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also no wild beast dare assail the man that beareth it on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also the diamond should be given freely without coveting and without buying and then it is of greater virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it maketh a man more strong and more sad against his enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it healeth him that is lunatic and them that the fiend pursueth or travaileth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if venom or poison be brought in presence of the diamond anon it beginneth to wax moist and for to sweat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there be also diamonds in ind that be clept violastres for their colour is like violet or more brown than the violets that be full hard and full precious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but yet some men love not them so well as the other but in sooth to me i would love them as much as the other for i have seen them assayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also there is another manner of diamonds that be as white as crystal but they be a little more trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be good and of great virtue and all they be square and pointed of their own kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some be six squared some four squared and some three as nature shapeth them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore when great lords and knights go to seek worship in arms they bear gladly the diamond upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall speak a little more of the diamonds although i tarry my matter for a time to the end that they that know them not be not deceived by gabbers that go by the country that sell them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for whoso will buy the diamond it is needful to him that he know them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because that men counterfeit them often of crystal that is yellow and of sapphires of citron colour that is yellow also and of the sapphire loupe and of many other stones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i tell you these counterfeits be not so hard and also the points will break lightly and men may easily polish them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but some workmen for malice will not polish them to that intent to make men believe that they may not be polished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but men may assay them in this manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first shear with them or write with them in sapphires in crystal or in other precious stones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that men take the adamant that is the shipmans stone that draweth the needle to him and men lay the diamond upon the adamant and lay the needle before the adamant and if the diamond be good and virtuous the adamant draweth not the needle to him whiles the diamond is there present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this is the proof that they beyond the sea make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> natheles it befalleth oftentime that the good diamond loseth his virtue by sin and for incontinence of him that beareth it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then it is needful to make it to recover his virtue again or else it is of little value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the customs of isles about ind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the difference betwixt idols and simulacres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of three manner growing of pepper upon one tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the well that changeth his odour every hour of the day and that in ind be full many diverse countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it is clept ind for a flom that runneth throughout the country that is clept ind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that flom men find eels of thirty foot long and more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the folk that dwell nigh that water be of evil colour green and yellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ind and about ind be more than isles good and great that men dwell in without those that he inhabitable and without other small isles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in every isle is great plenty of cities and of towns and of folk without number <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for men of ind have this condition of kind that they never go out of their own country and therefore is there great multitude of people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they be not stirring ne movable because that they be in the first climate that is of saturn and saturn is slow and little moving for he tarryeth to make his turn by the twelve signs thirty year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the moon passeth through the twelve signs in one month <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for because that saturn is of so late stirring therefore the folk of that country that be under his climate have of kind no will for to move ne stir to seek strange places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in our country is all the contrary for we be in the seventh climate that is of the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the moon is of lightly moving and the moon is planet of way and for that skill it giveth us will of kind for to move lightly and for to go divers ways and to seek strange things and other diversities of the world for the moon environeth the earth more hastily than any other planet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also men go through ind by many diverse countries to the great sea ocean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after men find there an isle that is clept crues <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thither come merchants of venice and genoa and of other marches for to buy merchandises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there is so great heat in those marches and namely in that isle that for the great distress of the heat mens ballocks hang down to their knees for the great dissolution of the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men of that country that know the manner let bind them up or else might they not live and anoint them with ointments made therefore to hold them up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that country and in ethiopia and in many other countries the folk lie all naked in rivers and waters men and women together from undern of the day till it be past the noon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they lie all in the water save the visage for the great heat that there is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the women have no shame of the men but lie all together side to side till the heat be past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there may men see many foul figure assembled and namely nigh the good towns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that isle be ships without nails of iron or bonds for the rocks of the adamants for they be all full thereabout in that sea that it is marvel to speak of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if a ship passed by those marches that had either iron bonds or iron nails anon he should be perished for the adamant of his kind draweth the iron to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so would it draw to him the ship because of the iron that he should never depart from it ne never go thence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that isle men go by sea to another isle that is clept chana where is great plenty of corn and wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was wont to be a great isle and a great haven and a good but the sea hath greatly wasted it and overcome it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of that country was wont to be so strong and so mighty that he held war against king alexander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the folk of that country have a diverse law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some of them worship the sun some the moon some the fire some trees some serpents or the first thing that they meet at morrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some worship simulacres and some idols <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but between simulacres and idols is a great difference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for simulacres be images made after likeness of men or of women or of the sun or of the moon or of any beast or of any kindly thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and idols is an image made of lewd will of man that man may not find among kindly things as an image that hath four heads one of a man another of an horse or of an ox or of some other beast that no man hath seen after kindly disposition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they that worship simulacres they worship them for some worthy man that was sometime as hercules and many other that did many marvels in their time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for they say well that they be not gods for they know well that there is a god of kind that made all things the which is in heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they know well that this may not do the marvels that he made but if it had been by the special gift of god and therefore they say that he was well with god and for because that he was so well with god therefore they worship him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so say they of the sun because that he changeth the time and giveth heat and nourisheth all things upon earth and for it is of so great profit they know well that that might not be but that god loveth it more than any other thing and for that skill god hath given it more great virtue in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore it is good reason as they say to do it worship and reverence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so say they and make their reasons of other planets and of the fire also because it is so profitable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of idols they say also that the ox is the most holy beast that is in earth and most patient and more profitable than any other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he doth good enough and he doth no evil and they know well that it may not be without special grace of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore make they their god of an ox the one part and the other half of a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because that man is the most noble creature in earth and also for he hath lordship above all beasts therefore make they the halvendel of idol of a man upwards and the tother half of an ox downwards and of serpents and of other beasts and diverse things that they worship that they meet first at morrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they worship also specially all those that they have good meeting of and when they speed well in their journey after their meeting and namely such as they have proved and assayed by experience of long time for they say that thilk good meeting ne may not come but of the grace of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore they make images like to those things that they have belief in for to behold them and worship them first at morning or they meet any contrarious things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there be also some christian men that say that some beasts have good meeting that is to say for to meet with them first at morrow and some beasts wicked meeting and that they have proved ofttime that the hare hath full evil meeting and swine and many other beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the sparrowhawk or other fowls of ravine when they fly after their prey and take it before men of arms it is a good sign and if he fail of taking his prey it is an evil sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also to such folk it is an evil meeting of ravens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in these things and in such other there be many folk that believe because it happeneth so oftentime to fall after their fantasies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also there be men enough that have no belief in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and sith that christian men have such belief that be informed and taught all day by holy doctrine wherein they should believe it is no marvel then that the paynims that have no good doctrine but only of their nature believe more largely for their simplesse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and truly i have seen of paynims and saracens that men clepe augurs that when we ride in arms in divers countries upon our enemies by the flying of fowls they would tell us the prognostications of things that fell after and so they did full oftentimes and proffered their heads towedde but if it would fall as they said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but natheles therefore should not a man put his belief in such things but always have full trust and belief in god our sovereign lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this isle of chana the saracens have won and hold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that isle be many lions and many other wild beasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there be rats in that isle as great as hounds here and men take them with great mastiffs for cats may not take them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this isle and many other men bury not no dead men for the heat is there so great that in a little time the flesh will consume from the bones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from thence men go by sea toward ind the more to a city that men clepe sarche that is a fair city and a good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there dwell many christian men of good faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there be many religious men and namely of mendicants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after go men by sea to the land of lomb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land groweth the pepper in the forest that men clepe combar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it groweth nowhere else in all the world but in that forest and that endureth well an eighteen journeys in length <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the forest be two good cities that one hight fladrine and that other zinglantz and in every of them dwell christian men and jews great plenty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it is a good country and a plentiful but there is overmuch passing heat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ye shall understand that the pepper groweth in manner as doth a wild vine that is planted fast by the trees of that wood for to sustain it by as doth the vine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the fruit thereof hangeth in manner as raisins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the tree is so thick charged that it seemeth that it would break <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when it is ripe it is all green as it were ivy berries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then men cut them as men do the vines and then they put it upon an oven and there it waxeth black and crisp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there is three manner of pepper all upon one tree long pepper black pepper and white pepper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the long pepper men clepe sorbotin and the black pepper is clept fulfulle and the white pepper is clept bano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the long pepper cometh first when the leaf beginneth to come and it is like the cats of hazel that cometh before the leaf and it hangeth low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after cometh the black with the leaf in manner of clusters of raisins all green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when men have gathered it then cometh the white that is somedeal less than the black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of that men bring but little into this country for they beyond withhold it for themselves because it is better and more attempre in kind than the black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore is there not so great plenty as of the black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that country be many manner of serpents and of other vermin for the great heat of the country and of the pepper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some men say that when they will gather the pepper they make fire and burn about to make the serpents and the cockodrills to flee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but save their grace of all that say so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if they burnt about the trees that bear the pepper should be burnt and it would dry up all the virtue as of any other thing and then they did themselves much harm and they should never quench the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but thus they do they anoint their hands and their feet with a juice made of snails and of other things made therefore of the which the serpents and the venomous beasts hate and dread the savour and that maketh them flee before them because of the smell and then they gather it surely enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also toward the head of that forest is the city of polombe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and above the city is a great mountain that also is clept polombe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of that mount the city hath his name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at the foot of that mount is a fair well and a great that hath odour and savour of all spices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at every hour of the day he changeth his odour and his savour diversely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and whoso drinketh three times fasting of that water of that well he is whole of all manner sickness that he hath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they that dwell there and drink often of that well they never have sickness and they seem always young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have drunken thereof three or four sithes and yet methinketh i fare the better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some men clepe it the well of youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for they that often drink thereof seem always younglike and live without sickness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men say that that well cometh out of paradise and therefore it is so virtuous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by all that country groweth good ginger and therefore thither go the merchants for spicery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land men worship the ox for his simpleness and for his meekness and for the profit that cometh of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say that he is the holiest beast in earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for them seemeth that whosoever be meek and patient he is holy and profitable for then they say he hath all virtues in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they make the ox to labour six year or seven and then they eat him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the king of the country hath alway an ox with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he that keepeth him hath every day great fees and keepeth every day his dung and his urine in two vessels of gold and bring it before their prelate that they clepe archiprotopapaton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he beareth it before the king and maketh there over a great blessing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the king wetteth his hands there in that they clepe gall and anointeth his front and his breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after he froteth him with the dung and with the urine with great reverence for to be fullfilled of virtues of the ox and made holy by the virtue of that holy thing that nought is worth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the king hath done then do the lords and after them their ministers and other men if they may have any remenant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that country they make idols half man half ox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in those idols evil spirits speak and give answer to men of what is asked them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before these idols men slay their children many times and spring the blood upon the idols and so they make their sacrifice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when any man dieth in the country they burn his body in name of penance to that intent that he suffer no pain in earth to be eaten of worms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if his wife have no child they burn her with him and say that it is reason that she make him company in that other world as she did in this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but and she have children with him they let her live with them to bring them up if she will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if that she love more to live with her children than for to die with her husband men hold her for false and cursed ne she shall never be loved ne trusted of the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if the woman die before the husband men burn him with her if that he will and if he will not no man constraineth him thereto but he may wed another time without blame or reproof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that country grow many strong vines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the women drink wine and men not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the women shave their beards and the men not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the dooms made by st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of devotion and sacrifice made to idols there in the city of calamye and of the procession from that country men pass by many marches toward a country a ten journeys thence that is clept mabaron and it is a great kingdom and it hath many fair cities and towns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that kingdom lieth the body of saint thomas the apostle in flesh and bone in a fair tomb in the city of calamye for there he was martyred and buried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men of assyria bare his body into mesopotamia into the city of edessa and after he was brought thither again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the arm and the hand that he put in our lords side when he appeared to him after his resurrection and said to him noli esse incredulus sed fidelis is yet lying in a vessel without the tomb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by that hand they make all their judgments in the country whoso hath right or wrong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for when there is any dissension between two parties and every of them maintaineth his cause and saith that his cause is rightful and that other saith the contrary then both parties write their causes in two bills and put them in the hand of saint thomas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and anon he casteth away the bill of the wrong cause and holdeth still the bill with the right cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore men come from far countries to have judgment of doubtable causes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and other judgment use they none there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also the church where saint thomas lieth is both great and fair and all full of great simulacres and those be great images that they clepe their gods of the which the least is as great as two men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and amongst these other there is a great image more than any of the other that is all covered with fine gold and precious stones and rich pearls and that idol is the god of false christians that have reneyed their faith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it sitteth in a chair of gold full nobly arrayed and he hath about his neck large girdles wrought of gold and precious stones and pearls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this church is full richly wrought and all overgilt within <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to that idol go men on pilgrimage as commonly and with as great devotion as christian men go to saint james or other holy pilgrimages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and many folk that come from far lands to seek that idol for the great devotion that they have they look never upward but evermore down to the earth for dread to see anything about them that should let them of their devotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some there be that go on pilgrimage to this idol that bear knives in their hands that be made full keen and sharp and always as they go they smite themselves in their arms and in their legs and in their thighs with many hideous wounds and so they shed their blood for love of that idol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say that he is blessed and holy that dieth so for love of his god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and other there be that lead their children for to slay to make sacrifice to that idol and after they have slain them they spring the blood upon the idol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some there be that come from far and in going toward this idol at every third pace that they go from their house they kneel and so continue till they come thither and when they come there they take incense and other aromatic things of noble smell and cense the idol as we would do here gods precious body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so come folk to worship this idol some from an hundred mile and some from many more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and before the minster of this idol is a vivary in manner of a great lake full of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therein pilgrims cast gold and silver pearls and precious stones without number instead of offerings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when the minister of that church need to make any reparation of the church or of any of the idols they take gold and silver pearls and precious stones out of the vivary to quit the costage of such thing as they make or repair so that that nothing is faulty but anon it shall be amended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ye shall understand that when there be great feasts and solemnities of that idol as the dedication of the church and the throning of the idol all the country about meet there together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they set this idol upon a car with great reverence well arrayed with cloths of gold of rich cloths of tartary of camaka and other precious cloths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they lead him about the city with great solemnity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and before the car go first in procession all the maidens of the country two and two together full ordinatly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after those maidens go the pilgrims <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some of them fall down under the wheels of the car and let the car go over them so that they be dead anon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some have their arms or their limbs all tobroken and some the sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all this do they for love of their god in great devotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and them thinketh that the more pain and the more tribulation that they suffer for love of their god the more joy they shall have in another world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and shortly to say you they suffer so great pains and so hard martyrdoms for love of their idol that a christian man i trow durst not take upon him the tenth part the pain for love of our lord jesu christ <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after i say you before the car go all the minstrels of the country without number with diverse instruments and they make all the melody that they can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when they have gone all about the city then they return again to the minster and put the idol again into his place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then for the love and in worship of that idol and for the reverence of the feast they slay themselves a two hundred or three hundred persons with sharp knives of the which they bring the bodies before the idol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they say that those be saints because that they slew themselves of their own good will for love of their idol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as men here that had an holy saint of his kin would think that it were to them an high worship right so then thinketh there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as men here devoutly would write holy saints lives and their miracles and sue for their canonizations right so do they there for them that slay themselves wilfully for love of their idol and say that they be glorious martyrs and saints and put them in their writings and in their litanies and avaunt them greatly one to another of their holy kinsmen that so become saints and say i have more holy saints in my kindred than thou in thine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the custom also there is this that when they that have such devotion and intent for to slay himself for love of his god they send for all their friends and have great plenty of minstrels and they go before the idol leading him that will slay himself for such devotion between them with great reverence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he all naked hath a full sharp knife in his hand and he cutteth a great piece of his flesh and casteth it in the face of his idol saying his orisons recommending him to his god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he smiteth himself and maketh great wounds and deep here and there till he fall down dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then his friends present his body to the idol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they say singing holy god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behold what thy true servant hath done for thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hath forsaken his wife and his children and his riches and all the goods of the world and his own life for the love of thee and to make thee sacrifice of his flesh and of his blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherefore holy god put him among thy best beloved saints in thy bliss of paradise for he hath well deserved it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they make a great fire and burn the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then everych of his friends take a quantity of the ashes and keep them instead of relics and say that it is holy thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they have no dread of no peril whiles they have those holy ashes upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they put his name in their litanies as a saint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the evil customs used in the isle of lamary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how the earth and the sea be of round form and shape by proof of the star that from that country go men by the sea ocean and by many divers isles and by many countries that were too long for to tell of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a fiftytwo journeys from this land that i have spoken of there is another land that is full great that men clepe lamary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land is full great heat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the custom there is such that men and women go all naked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they scorn when they see any strange folk going clothed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say that god made adam and eve all naked and that no man should shame him to shew him such as god made him for nothing is foul that is of kindly nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say that they that be clothed be folk of another world or they be folk that trow not in god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say that they believe in god that formed the world and that made adam and eve and all other things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they wed there no wives for all the women there be common and they forsake no man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say they sin if they refuse any man and so god commanded to adam and eve and to all that come of him when he said crescite et multiplicamini et replete terram <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore may no man in that country say this is my wife ne no woman may say this my husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when they have children they may give them to what man they will that hath companied with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also all the land is common for all that a man holdeth one year another man hath it another year and every man taketh what part that him liketh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also all the goods of the land be common corns and all other things for nothing there is kept in close ne nothing there is under lock and every man there taketh what he will without any contradiction and as rich is one man there as is another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in that country there is a cursed custom for they eat more gladly mans flesh than any other flesh and yet is that country abundant of flesh of fish of corns of gold and silver and of all other goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thither go merchants and bring with them children to sell to them of the country and they buy them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if they be fat they eat them anon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if they be lean they feed them till they be fat and then they eat them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they say that it is the best flesh and the sweetest of all the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land ne in many other beyond that no man may see the star transmontane that is clept the star of the sea that is unmovable and that is toward the north that we clepe the lodestar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but men see another star the contrary to him that is toward the south that is clept antartic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and right as the shipmen take their advice here and govern them by the lodestar right so do shipmen beyond those parts by the star of the south the which star appeareth not to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this star that is toward the north that we clepe the lodestar ne appeareth not to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for which cause men may well perceive that the land and the sea be of round shape and form for the part of the firmament sheweth in one country that sheweth not in another country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men may well prove by experience and subtle compassment of wit that if a man found passages by ships that would go to search the world men might go by ship all about the world and above and beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the which thing i prove thus after that i have seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i have been toward the parts of brabant and beholden the astrolabe that the star that is clept the transmontane is fiftythree degrees high and more further in almayne and bohemia it hath fiftyeight degrees and more further toward the parts septentrional it is sixtytwo degrees of height and certain minutes for i myself have measured it by the astrolabe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now shall ye know that against the transmontane is the tother star that is clept antarctic as i have said before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and those two stars ne move never and by them turneth all the firmament right as doth a wheel that turneth by his axletree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that those stars bear the firmament in two equal parts so that it hath as much above as it hath beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after this i have gone toward the parts meridional that is toward the south and i have found that in lybia men see first the star antarctic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so far i have gone more further in those countries that i have found that star more high so that toward the high lybia it is eighteen degrees of height and certain minutes of the which sixty minutes make a degree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after going by sea and by land toward this country of that i have spoken and to other isles and lands beyond that country i have found the star antarctic of thirtythree degrees of height and more minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i had had company and shipping for to go more beyond i trow well in certain that we should have seen all the roundness of the firmament all about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for as i have said to you before the half of the firmament is between those two stars the which halvendel i have seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of the tother halvendel i have seen toward the north under the transmontane sixtytwo degrees and ten minutes and toward the part meridional i have seen under the antarctic thirtythree degrees and sixteen minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the halvendel of the firmament in all holdeth not but nine score degrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and of those nine score i have seen sixtytwo on that one part and thirtythree on that other part that be ninetyfive degrees and nigh the halvendel of a degree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so there ne faileth but that i have seen all the firmament save four score and four degrees and the halvendel of a degree and that is not the fourth part of the firmament for the fourth part of the roundness of the firmament holds four score and ten degrees so there faileth but five degrees and an half of the fourth part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also i have seen the three parts of all the roundness of the firmament and more yet five degrees and a half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the which i say you certainly that men may environ all the earth of all the world as well under as above and turn again to his country that had company and shipping and conduct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and always he should find men lands and isles as well as in this country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for ye wit well that they that be toward the antarctic they be straight feet against feet of them that dwell under the transmontane also well as we and they that dwell under us be feet against feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all the parts of sea and of land have their opposites habitable trepassable and they of this half and beyond half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and wit well that after that that i may perceive and comprehend the lands of prester john emperor of ind be under us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for in going from scotland or from england toward jerusalem men go upward always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for our land is in the low part of the earth toward the west and the land of prester john is in the low part of the earth toward the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they have there the day when we have the night and also high to the contrary they have the night when we have the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the earth and the sea be of round form and shape as i have said before and that that men go upward to one coast men go downward to another coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also ye have heard me say that jerusalem is in the midst of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that may men prove and shew there by a spear that is pight into the earth upon the hour of midday when it is equinox that sheweth no shadow on no side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that it should be in the midst of the world david witnesseth it in the psalter where he saith deus operatus est salutem in media terrae <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they that part from those parts of the west for to go toward jerusalem as many journeys as they go upward for to go thither in as many journeys may they go from jerusalem unto other confines of the superficiality of the earth beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when men go beyond those journeys toward ind and to the foreign isles all is environing the roundness of the earth and of the sea under our countries on this half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore hath it befallen many times of one thing that i have heard counted when i was young how a worthy man departed sometime from our countries for to go search the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so he passed ind and the isles beyond ind where be more than isles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so long he went by sea and land and so environed the world by many seasons that he found an isle where he heard speak his own language calling on oxen in the plough such words as men speak to beasts in his own country whereof he had great marvel for he knew not how it might be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i say that he had gone so long by land and by sea that he had environed all the earth that he was come again environing that is to say going about unto his own marches and if he would have passed further till he had found his country and his own knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he turned again from thence from whence he was come from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so he lost much painful labour as himself said a great while after that he was come home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it befell after that he went into norway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there tempest of the sea took him and he arrived in an isle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he was in that isle he knew well that it was the isle where he had heard speak his own language before and the calling of oxen at the plough and that was possible thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how it seemeth to simple men unlearned that men ne may not go under the earth and also that men should fall toward the heaven from under <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that may not be upon less than we may fall toward heaven from the earth where we be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for from what part of the earth that men dwell either above or beneath it seemeth always to them that dwell that they go more right than any other folk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and right as it seemeth to us that they be under us right so it seemeth to them that we be under them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for if a man might fall from the earth unto the firmament by greater reason the earth and the sea that be so great and so heavy should fall to the firmament but that may not be and therefore saith our lord god non timeas me qui suspendi terram ex nihilo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and albeit that it be possible thing that men may so environ all the world natheles of a thousand persons one ne might not happen to return into his country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for for the greatness of the earth and of the sea men may go by a thousand and a thousand other ways that no man could ready him perfectly toward the parts that he came from but if it were by adventure and hap or by the grace of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the earth is full large and full great and holds in roundness and about environ by above and by beneath miles after the opinion of old wise astronomers and their sayings i reprove nought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after my little wit it seemeth me saving their reverence that it is more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for to have better understanding i say thus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be there imagined a figure that hath a great compass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and about the point of the great compass that is clept the centre be made another little compass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then after be the great compass devised by lines in many parts and that all the lines meet at the centre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that in as many parts as the great compass shall be departed in as many shall be departed the little that is about the centre albeit that the spaces be less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now then be the great compass represented for the firmament and the little compass represented for the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now then the firmament is devised by astronomers in twelve signs and every sign is devised in thirty degrees that is degrees that the firmament hath above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also be the earth devised in as many parts as the firmament and let every part answer to a degree of the firmament <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and wit it well that after the authors of astronomy furlongs of earth answer to a degree of the firmament and those be eightyseven miles and four furlongs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now be that here multiplied by sithes and then they be miles every of eight furlongs after miles of our country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so much hath the earth in roundness and of height environ after mine opinion and mine understanding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ye shall understand that after the opinion of old wise philosophers and astronomers our country ne ireland ne wales ne scotland ne norway ne the other isles coasting to them ne be not in the superficiality counted above the earth as it sheweth by all the books of astronomy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the superficiality of the earth is parted in seven parts for the seven planets and those parts be clept climates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and our parts be not of the seven climates for they be descending toward the west drawing towards the roundness of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also these isles of ind which be even against us be not reckoned in the climates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for they be against us that be in the low country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the seven climates stretch them environing the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the palace of the king of the isle of java <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the trees that bear meal honey wine and venom and of other marvels and customs beside that isle that i have spoken of there is another isle that is clept sumobor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a great isle and the king thereof is right mighty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the folk of that isle make them always to be marked in the visage with an hot iron both men and women for great noblesse for to be known from other folk for they hold themselves most noble and most worthy of all the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they have war always with the folk that go all naked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and fast beside is another isle that is clept betemga that is a good isle and a plenteous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and many other isles be thereabout where there be many of diverse folk of the which it were too long to speak of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but fast beside that isle for to pass by sea is a great isle and a great country that men clepe java <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it is nigh two thousand mile in circuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the king of that country is a full great lord and a rich and a mighty and hath under him seven other kings of seven other isles about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this isle is full well inhabited and full well manned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there grow all manner of spicery more plenteously than in any other country as of ginger cloves gilofre canell seedwall nutmegs and maces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and wit well that the nutmeg beareth the maces for right as the nut of the hazel hath an husk without that the nut is closed in till it be ripe and that after falleth out right so it is of the nutmeg and of the maces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many other spices and many other goods grow in that isle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for of all things is there plenty save only of wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there is gold and silver great plenty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the king of that country hath a palace full noble and full marvellous and more rich than any in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all the degrees to go up into halls and chambers be one of gold another of silver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also the pavements of halls and chambers be all square of gold one and another of silver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the walls within be covered with gold and silver in fine plates and in those plates be stories and battles of knights enleved and the crowns and the circles about their heads be made of precious stones and rich pearls and great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the halls and the chambers of the palace be all covered within with gold and silver so that no man would trow the riches of that palace but he had seen it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and wit well that the king of that isle is so mighty that he hath many times overcome the great chan of cathay in battle that is the most great emperor that is under the firmament either beyond the sea or on this half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for they have had oftentime war between them because that the great chan would constrain him to hold his land of him but that other at all times defendeth him well against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that isle in going by sea men find another isle good and great that men clepe pathen that is a great kingdom full of fair cities and full of towns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land grow trees that bear meal whereof men make good bread and white and of good savour and it seemeth as it were of wheat but it is not allinges of such savour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there be other trees that bear honey good and sweet and other trees that bear venom against the which there is no medicine but one and that is to take their proper leaves and stamp them and temper them with water and then drink it and else he shall die for triacle will not avail ne none other medicine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of this venom the jews had let seek of one of their friends for to empoison all christianity as i have heard them say in their confession before their dying but thanked be almighty god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they failed of their purpose but always they make great mortality of people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and other trees there be also that bear wine of noble sentiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you like to hear how the meal cometh out of the trees i shall say you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the monstrous cat walked over to one side of the room and coiled itself up under a grating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everard king came out and taking the iron handle which i have mentioned he began to turn it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he did so the line of bars in the corridor began to pass through a slot in the wall and closed up the front of this grating so as to make an effective cage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it was in position he opened the door once more and invited me into the room which was heavy with the pungent musty smell peculiar to the great carnivora <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats how we work it said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we give him the run of the room for exercise and then at night we put him in his cage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can let him out by turning the handle from the passage or you can as you have seen coop him up in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no you should not do that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had put my hand between the bars to pat the glossy heaving flank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pulled it back with a serious face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you that he is not safe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont imagine that because i can take liberties with him anyone else can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is very exclusive in his friendsarent you tommy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah he hears his lunch coming to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a step sounded in the stoneflagged passage and the creature had sprung to his feet and was pacing up and down the narrow cage his yellow eyes gleaming and his scarlet tongue rippling and quivering over the white line of his jagged teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a groom entered with a coarse joint upon a tray and thrust it through the bars to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pounced lightly upon it carried it off to the corner and there holding it between his paws tore and wrenched at it raising his bloody muzzle every now and then to look at us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a malignant and yet fascinating sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant wonder that i am fond of him can you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said my host as we left the room especially when you consider that i have had the rearing of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was no joke bringing him over from the centre of south america but here he is safe and soundand as i have said far the most perfect specimen in europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people at the zoo are dying to have him but i really cant part with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i think that i have inflicted my hobby upon you long enough so we cannot do better than follow tommys example and go to our lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my south american relative was so engrossed by his grounds and their curious occupants that i hardly gave him credit at first for having any interests outside them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that he had some and pressing ones was soon borne in upon me by the number of telegrams which he received <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they arrived at all hours and were always opened by him with the utmost eagerness and anxiety upon his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i imagined that it must be the turf and sometimes the stock exchange but certainly he had some very urgent business going forwards which was not transacted upon the downs of suffolk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the six days of my visit he had never fewer than three or four telegrams a day and sometimes as many as seven or eight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had occupied these six days so well that by the end of them i had succeeded in getting upon the most cordial terms with my cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every night we had sat up late in the billiardroom he telling me the most extraordinary stories of his adventures in americastories so desperate and reckless that i could hardly associate them with the brown little chubby man before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in return i ventured upon some of my own reminiscences of london life which interested him so much that he vowed he would come up to grosvenor mansions and stay with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was anxious to see the faster side of city life and certainly though i say it he could not have chosen a more competent guide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not until the last day of my visit that i ventured to approach that which was on my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him frankly about my pecuniary difficulties and my impending ruin and i asked his advicethough i hoped for something more solid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened attentively puffing hard at his cigar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but surely said he you are the heir of our relative lord southerton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have every reason to believe so but he would never make me any allowance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no i have heard of his miserly ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my poor marshall your position has been a very hard one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the way have you heard any news of lord southertons health lately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has always been in a critical condition ever since my childhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exactlya creaking hinge if ever there was one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your inheritance may be a long way off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dear me how awkwardly situated you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had some hopes sir that you knowing all the facts might be inclined to advance dont say another word my dear boy he cried with the utmost cordiality we shall talk it over tonight and i give you my word that whatever is in my power shall be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not sorry that my visit was drawing to a close for it is unpleasant to feel that there is one person in the house who eagerly desires your departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kings sallow face and forbidding eyes had become more and more hateful to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was no longer actively rudeher fear of her husband prevented herbut she pushed her insane jealousy to the extent of ignoring me never addressing me and in every way making my stay at greylands as uncomfortable as she could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so offensive was her manner during that last day that i should certainly have left had it not been for that interview with my host in the evening which would i hoped retrieve my broken fortunes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was very late when it occurred for my relative who had been receiving even more telegrams than usual during the day went off to his study after dinner and only emerged when the household had retired to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard him go round locking the doors as custom was of a night and finally he joined me in the billiard room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his stout figure was wrapped in a dressinggown and he wore a pair of red turkish slippers without any heels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> settling down into an armchair he brewed himself a glass of grog in which i could not help noticing that the whisky considerably predominated over the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind was howling and screaming round the house and the latticed windows rattled and shook as if they were coming in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the glow of the yellow lamps and the flavour of our cigars seemed the brighter and more fragrant for the contrast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now my boy said my host we have the house and the night to ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let me have an idea of how your affairs stand and i will see what can be done to set them in order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish to hear every detail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus encouraged i entered into a long exposition in which all my tradesmen and creditors from my landlord to my valet figured in turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had notes in my pocketbook and i marshalled my facts and gave i flatter myself a very businesslike statement of my own unbusinesslike ways and lamentable position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was depressed however to notice that my companions eyes were vacant and his attention elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he did occasionally throw out a remark it was so entirely perfunctory and pointless that i was sure he had not in the least followed my remarks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every now and then he roused himself and put on some show of interest asking me to repeat or to explain more fully but it was always to sink once more into the same brown study <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he rose and threw the end of his cigar into the grate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill tell you what my boy said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never had a head for figures so you will excuse me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must jot it all down upon paper and let me have a note of the amount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill understand it when i see it in black and white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now its time we were in bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by jove theres one oclock striking in the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tingling of the chiming clock broke through the deep roar of the gale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind was sweeping past with the rush of a great river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must see my cat before i go to bed said my host <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tread softly and dont speak for everyone is asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we passed quietly down the lamplit persianrugged hall and through the door at the farther end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all was dark in the stone corridor but a stable lantern hung on a hook and my host took it down and lit it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no grating visible in the passage so i knew that the beast was in its cage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said my relative and opened the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a deep growling as we entered showed that the storm had really excited the creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the flickering light of the lantern we saw it a huge black mass coiled in the corner of its den and throwing a squat uncouth shadow upon the whitewashed wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its tail switched angrily among the straw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor tommy is not in the best of tempers said everard king holding up the lantern and looking in at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a black devil he looks doesnt he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must give him a little supper to put him in a better humour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you mind holding the lantern for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took it from his hand and he stepped to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his larder is just outside here said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will excuse me for an instant wont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he passed out and the door shut with a sharp metallic click behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that hard crisp sound made my heart stand still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sudden wave of terror passed over me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a vague perception of some monstrous treachery turned me cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sprang to the door but there was no handle upon the inner side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said my host from the passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got the light all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but i dont care about being locked in alone like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard his hearty chuckling laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you i dont allow practical jokes of this sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> practical is the word said he with another hateful chuckle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then suddenly i heard amidst the roar of the storm the creak and whine of the winchhandle turning and the rattle of the grating as it passed through the slot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great god he was letting loose the brazilian cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the light of the lantern i saw the bars sliding slowly before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already there was an opening a foot wide at the farther end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a scream i seized the last bar with my hands and pulled with the strength of a madman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a madman with rage and horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a minute or more i held the thing motionless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that he was straining with all his force upon the handle and that the leverage was sure to overcome me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave inch by inch my feet sliding along the stones and all the time i begged and prayed this inhuman monster to save me from this horrible death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i conjured him by his kinship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reminded him that i was his guest i begged to know what harm i had ever done him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his only answers were the tugs and jerks upon the handle each of which in spite of all my struggles pulled another bar through the opening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clinging and clutching i was dragged across the whole front of the cage until at last with aching wrists and lacerated fingers i gave up the hopeless struggle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grating clanged back as i released it and an instant later i heard the shuffle of the turkish slippers in the passage and the slam of the distant door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the creature had never moved during this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lay still in the corner and his tail had ceased switching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this apparition of a man adhering to his bars and dragged screaming across him had apparently filled him with amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw his great eyes staring steadily at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had dropped the lantern when i seized the bars but it still burned upon the floor and i made a movement to grasp it with some idea that its light might protect me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the instant i moved the beast gave a deep and menacing growl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stopped and stood still quivering with fear in every limb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cat if one may call so fearful a creature by so homely a name was not more than ten feet from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eyes glimmered like two disks of phosphorus in the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they appalled and yet fascinated me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not take my own eyes from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nature plays strange tricks with us at such moments of intensity and those glimmering lights waxed and waned with a steady rise and fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes they seemed to be tiny points of extreme brilliancylittle electric sparks in the black obscuritythen they would widen and widen until all that corner of the room was filled with their shifting and sinister light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then suddenly they went out altogether <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beast had closed its eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know whether there may be any truth in the old idea of the dominance of the human gaze or whether the huge cat was simply drowsy but the fact remains that far from showing any symptom of attacking me it simply rested its sleek black head upon its huge forepaws and seemed to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood fearing to move lest i should rouse it into malignant life once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at least i was able to think clearly now that the baleful eyes were off me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here i was shut up for the night with the ferocious beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my own instincts to say nothing of the words of the plausible villain who laid this trap for me warned me that the animal was as savage as its master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could i stave it off until morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door was hopeless and so were the narrow barred windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no shelter anywhere in the bare stone flagged room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to cry for assistance was absurd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that this den was an outhouse and that the corridor which connected it with the house was at least a hundred feet long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides with the gale thundering outside my cries were not likely to be heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had only my own courage and my own wits to trust to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then with a fresh wave of horror my eyes fell upon the lantern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the candle had burned low and was already beginning to gutter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ten minutes it would be out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had only ten minutes then in which to do something for i felt that if i were once left in the dark with that fearful beast i should be incapable of action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very thought of it paralysed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cast my despairing eyes round this chamber of death and they rested upon one spot which seemed to promise i will not say safety but less immediate and imminent danger than the open floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have said that the cage had a top as well as a front and this top was left standing when the front was wound through the slot in the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it consisted of bars at a few inches interval with stout wire netting between and it rested upon a strong stanchion at each end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it stood now as a great barred canopy over the crouching figure in the corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the space between this iron shelf and the roof may have been from two or three feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could only get up there squeezed in between bars and ceiling i should have only one vulnerable side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should be safe from below from behind and from each side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only on the open face of it could i be attacked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there it is true i had no protection whatever but at least i should be out of the brutes path when he began to pace about his den <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have to come out of his way to reach me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was now or never for if once the light were out it would be impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a gulp in my throat i sprang up seized the iron edge of the top and swung myself panting on to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i writhed in face downwards and found myself looking straight into the terrible eyes and yawning jaws of the cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its fetid breath came up into my face like the steam from some foul pot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeared however to be rather curious than angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a sleek ripple of its long black back it rose stretched itself and then rearing itself on its hind legs with one forepaw against the wall it raised the other and drew its claws across the wire meshes beneath me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one sharp white hook tore through my trousersfor i may mention that i was still in evening dressand dug a furrow in my knee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not meant as an attack but rather as an experiment for upon my giving a sharp cry of pain he dropped down again and springing lightly into the room he began walking swiftly round it looking up every now and again in my direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my part i shuffled backwards until i lay with my back against the wall screwing myself into the smallest space possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the farther i got the more difficult it was for him to attack me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed more excited now that he had begun to move about and he ran swiftly and noiselessly round and round the den passing continually underneath the iron couch upon which i lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was wonderful to see so great a bulk passing like a shadow with hardly the softest thudding of velvety pads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the candle was burning lowso low that i could hardly see the creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then with a last flare and splutter it went out altogether <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was alone with the cat in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it helps one to face a danger when one knows that one has done all that possibly can be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing for it then but to quietly await the result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this case there was no chance of safety anywhere except the precise spot where i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stretched myself out therefore and lay silently almost breathlessly hoping that the beast might forget my presence if i did nothing to remind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckoned that it must already be two oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at four it would be full dawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not more than two hours to wait for daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> outside the storm was still raging and the rain lashed continually against the little windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inside the poisonous and fetid air was overpowering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could neither hear nor see the cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried to think about other thingsbut only one had power enough to draw my mind from my terrible position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was the contemplation of my cousins villainy his unparalleled hypocrisy his malignant hatred of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beneath that cheerful face there lurked the spirit of a mediaeval assassin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as i thought of it i saw more clearly how cunningly the thing had been arranged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had apparently gone to bed with the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt he had his witness to prove it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then unknown to them he had slipped down had lured me into his den and abandoned me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his story would be so simple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had left me to finish my cigar in the billiardroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had gone down on my own account to have a last look at the cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had entered the room without observing that the cage was opened and i had been caught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could such a crime be brought home to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how slowly those dreadful two hours went by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once i heard a low rasping sound which i took to be the creature licking its own fur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several times those greenish eyes gleamed at me through the darkness but never in a fixed stare and my hopes grew stronger that my presence had been forgotten or ignored <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the least faint glimmer of light came through the windowsi first dimly saw them as two grey squares upon the black wall then grey turned to white and i could see my terrible companion once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he alas could see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was evident to me at once that he was in a much more dangerous and aggressive mood than when i had seen him last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cold of the morning had irritated him and he was hungry as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a continual growl he paced swiftly up and down the side of the room which was farthest from my refuge his whiskers bristling angrily and his tail switching and lashing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he turned at the corners his savage eyes always looked upwards at me with a dreadful menace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew then that he meant to kill me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet i found myself even at that moment admiring the sinuous grace of the devilish thing its long undulating rippling movements the gloss of its beautiful flanks the vivid palpitating scarlet of the glistening tongue which hung from the jetblack muzzle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the time that deep threatening growl was rising and rising in an unbroken crescendo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that the crisis was at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a miserable hour to meet such a deathso cold so comfortless shivering in my light dress clothes upon this gridiron of torment upon which i was stretched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried to brace myself to it to raise my soul above it and at the same time with the lucidity which comes to a perfectly desperate man i cast round for some possible means of escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one thing was clear to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if that front of the cage was only back in its position once more i could find a sure refuge behind it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could i possibly pull it back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hardly dared to move for fear of bringing the creature upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly very slowly i put my hand forward until it grasped the edge of the front the final bar which protruded through the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to my surprise it came quite easily to my jerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course the difficulty of drawing it out arose from the fact that i was clinging to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pulled again and three inches of it came through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so quick so sudden that i never saw it happen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply heard the savage snarl and in an instant afterwards the blazing yellow eyes the flattened black head with its red tongue and flashing teeth were within reach of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the impact of the creature shook the bars upon which i lay until i thought as far as i could think of anything at such a moment that they were coming down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cat swayed there for an instant the head and front paws quite close to me the hind paws clawing to find a grip upon the edge of the grating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard the claws rasping as they clung to the wirenetting and the breath of the beast made me sick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its bound had been miscalculated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it could not retain its position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly grinning with rage and scratching madly at the bars it swung backwards and dropped heavily upon the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a growl it instantly faced round to me and crouched for another spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that the next few moments would decide my fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the creature had learned by experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must act promptly fearlessly if i were to have a chance for life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant i had formed my plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pulling off my dresscoat i threw it down over the head of the beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same moment i dropped over the edge seized the end of the front grating and pulled it frantically out of the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it came more easily than i could have expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rushed across the room bearing it with me but as i rushed the accident of my position put me upon the outer side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had it been the other way i might have come off scathless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was there was a moments pause as i stopped it and tried to pass in through the opening which i had left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that moment was enough to give time to the creature to toss off the coat with which i had blinded him and to spring upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hurled myself through the gap and pulled the rails to behind me but he seized my leg before i could entirely withdraw it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one stroke of that huge paw tore off my calf as a shaving of wood curls off before a plane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next moment bleeding and fainting i was lying among the foul straw with a line of friendly bars between me and the creature which ramped so frantically against them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too wounded to move and too faint to be conscious of fear i could only lie more dead than alive and watch it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it pressed its broad black chest against the bars and angled for me with its crooked paws as i have seen a kitten do before a mousetrap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it ripped my clothes but stretch as it would it could not quite reach me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard of the curious numbing effect produced by wounds from the great carnivora and now i was destined to experience it for i had lost all sense of personality and was as interested in the cats failure or success as if it were some game which i was watching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then gradually my mind drifted away into strange vague dreams always with that black face and red tongue coming back into them and so i lost myself in the nirvana of delirium the blessed relief of those who are too sorely tried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tracing the course of events afterwards i conclude that i must have been insensible for about two hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what roused me to consciousness once more was that sharp metallic click which had been the precursor of my terrible experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the shooting back of the spring lock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then before my senses were clear enough to entirely apprehend what they saw i was aware of the round benevolent face of my cousin peering in through the open door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he saw evidently amazed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the cat crouching on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was stretched upon my back in my shirtsleeves within the cage my trousers torn to ribbons and a great pool of blood all round me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can see his amazed face now with the morning sunlight upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he peered at me and peered again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he closed the door behind him and advanced to the cage to see if i were really dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot undertake to say what happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not in a fit state to witness or to chronicle such events <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can only say that i was suddenly conscious that his face was away from methat he was looking towards the animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he came near the bars with his back still towards me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly even in my bemuddled brain a remembrance came of those words of his when he had said that the taste of blood would turn the cat into a fiend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my blood had done it but he was to pay the price <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i heard him fall and rise and fall again with a sound like the ripping of sacking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his screams grew fainter until they were lost in the worrying snarl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then after i thought that he was dead i saw as in a nightmare a blinded tattered bloodsoaked figure running wildly round the roomand that was the last glimpse which i had of him before i fainted once again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was many months in my recoveryin fact i cannot say that i have ever recovered for to the end of my days i shall carry a stick as a sign of my night with the brazilian cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baldwin the groom and the other servants could not tell what had occurred when drawn by the deathcries of their master they found me behind the bars and his remainsor what they afterwards discovered to be his remainsin the clutch of the creature which he had reared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stalled him off with hot irons and afterwards shot him through the loophole of the door before they could finally extricate me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was carried to my bedroom and there under the roof of my wouldbe murderer i remained between life and death for several weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had sent for a surgeon from clipton and a nurse from london and in a month i was able to be carried to the station and so conveyed back once more to grosvenor mansions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have one remembrance of that illness which might have been part of the everchanging panorama conjured up by a delirious brain were it not so definitely fixed in my memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night when the nurse was absent the door of my chamber opened and a tall woman in blackest mourning slipped into the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she came across to me and as she bent her sallow face i saw by the faint gleam of the nightlight that it was the brazilian woman whom my cousin had married <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stared intently into my face and her expression was more kindly than i had ever seen it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feebly noddedfor i was still very weak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then i only wished to say to you that you have yourself to blame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did i not do all i could for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the beginning i tried to drive you from the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by every means short of betraying my husband i tried to save you from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that he had a reason for bringing you here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that he would never let you get away again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one knew him as i knew him who had suffered from him so often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not dare to tell you all this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i did my best for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as things have turned out you have been the best friend that i have ever had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have set me free and i fancied that nothing but death would do that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry if you are hurt but i cannot reproach myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told you that you were a fooland a fool you have been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she crept out of the room the bitter singular woman and i was never destined to see her again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with what remained from her husbands property she went back to her native land and i have heard that she afterwards took the veil at pernambuco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not until i had been back in london for some time that the doctors pronounced me to be well enough to do business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not a very welcome permission to me for i feared that it would be the signal for an inrush of creditors but it was summers my lawyer who first took advantage of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very glad to see that your lordship is so much better said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been waiting a long time to offer my congratulations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is no time for joking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean what i say he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have been lord southerton for the last six weeks but we feared that it would retard your recovery if you were to learn it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the richest peers in england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not believe my ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then suddenly i thought of the time which had elapsed and how it coincided with my injuries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then lord southerton must have died about the same time that i was hurt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his death occurred upon that very day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> summers looked hard at me as i spoke and i am convincedfor he was a very shrewd fellowthat he had guessed the true state of the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused for a moment as if awaiting a confidence from me but i could not see what was to be gained by exposing such a family scandal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes a very curious coincidence he continued with the same knowing look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course you are aware that your cousin everard king was the next heir to the estates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if it had been you instead of him who had been torn to pieces by this tiger or whatever it was then of course he would have been lord southerton at the present moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he took such an interest in it said summers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i happen to know that the late lord southertons valet was in his pay and that he used to have telegrams from him every few hours to tell him how he was getting on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be about the time when you were down there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it not strange that he should wish to be so well informed since he knew that he was not the direct heir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now summers if you will bring me my bills and a new chequebook we will begin to get things into order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the confession of herbert de lernac now lying under sentence of death at marseilles has thrown a light upon one of the most inexplicable crimes of the centuryan incident which is i believe absolutely unprecedented in the criminal annals of any country although there is a reluctance to discuss the matter in official circles and little information has been given to the press there are still indications that the statement of this archcriminal is corroborated by the facts and that we have at last found a solution for a most astounding business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the matter is eight years old and as its importance was somewhat obscured by a political crisis which was engaging the public attention at the time it may be as well to state the facts as far as we have been able to ascertain them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are collated from the liverpool papers of that date from the proceedings at the inquest upon john slater the enginedriver and from the records of the london and west coast railway company which have been courteously put at my disposal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> briefly they are as on the rd of june a gentleman who gave his name as monsieur louis caratal desired an interview with mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> james bland the superintendent of the london and west coast central station in liverpool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a small man middleaged and dark with a stoop which was so marked that it suggested some deformity of the spine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was accompanied by a friend a man of imposing physique whose deferential manner and constant attention showed that his position was one of dependence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this friend or companion whose name did not transpire was certainly a foreigner and probably from his swarthy complexion either a spaniard or a south american <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one peculiarity was observed in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he carried in his left hand a small black leather dispatch box and it was noticed by a sharp eyed clerk in the central office that this box was fastened to his wrist by a strap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no importance was attached to the fact at the time but subsequent events endowed it with some significance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur caratal was shown up to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blands office while his companion remained outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur caratals business was quickly dispatched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had arrived that afternoon from central america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> affairs of the utmost importance demanded that he should be in paris without the loss of an unnecessary hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had missed the london express <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the company would speed him on his way they might make their own terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bland struck the electric bell summoned mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> potter hood the traffic manager and had the matter arranged in five minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train would start in threequarters of an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would take that time to insure that the line should be clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the powerful engine called rochdale no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the companys register was attached to two carriages with a guards van behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first carriage was solely for the purpose of decreasing the inconvenience arising from the oscillation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second was divided as usual into four compartments a firstclass a firstclass smoking a secondclass and a secondclass smoking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first compartment which was nearest to the engine was the one allotted to the travellers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the guard of the special train was james mcpherson who had been some years in the service of the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stoker william smith was a new hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur caratal upon leaving the superintendents office rejoined his companion and both of them manifested extreme impatience to be off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having paid the money asked which amounted to fifty pounds five shillings at the usual special rate of five shillings a mile they demanded to be shown the carriage and at once took their seats in it although they were assured that the better part of an hour must elapse before the line could be cleared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime a singular coincidence had occurred in the office which monsieur caratal had just quitted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a request for a special is not a very uncommon circumstance in a rich commercial centre but that two should be required upon the same afternoon was most unusual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it so happened however that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bland had hardly dismissed the first traveller before a second entered with a similar request <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horace moore a gentlemanly man of military appearance who alleged that the sudden serious illness of his wife in london made it absolutely imperative that he should not lose an instant in starting upon the journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his distress and anxiety were so evident that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bland did all that was possible to meet his wishes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a second special was out of the question as the ordinary local service was already somewhat deranged by the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was the alternative however that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moore should share the expense of monsieur caratals train and should travel in the other empty firstclass compartment if monsieur caratal objected to having him in the one which he occupied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was difficult to see any objection to such an arrangement and yet monsieur caratal upon the suggestion being made to him by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> potter hood absolutely refused to consider it for an instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train was his he said and he would insist upon the exclusive use of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all argument failed to overcome his ungracious objections and finally the plan had to be abandoned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horace moore left the station in great distress after learning that his only course was to take the ordinary slow train which leaves liverpool at six oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at four thirtyone exactly by the station clock the special train containing the crippled monsieur caratal and his gigantic companion steamed out of the liverpool station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the line was at that time clear and there should have been no stoppage before manchester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trains of the london and west coast railway run over the lines of another company as far as this town which should have been reached by the special rather before six oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at a quarter after six considerable surprise and some consternation were caused amongst the officials at liverpool by the receipt of a telegram from manchester to say that it had not yet arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helens which is a third of the way between to james bland superintendent central l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with one accord nicholas and i looked at charley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that comes of imagination he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you see a thing youve got to see it all around or whats the good of seeing it at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw the beach so i left a couple of constables behind to keep an eye on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the siege of the lancashire queen possibly our most exasperating experience on the fish patrol was when charley le grant and i laid a two weeks siege to a big four masted english ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before we had finished with the affair it became a pretty mathematical problem and it was by the merest chance that we came into possession of the instrument that brought it to a successful termination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after our raid on the oyster pirates we had returned to oakland where two more weeks passed before neil partingtons wife was out of danger and on the highroad to recovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it was after an absence of a month all told that we turned the reindeers nose toward benicia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the cats away the mice will play and in these four weeks the fishermen had become very bold in violating the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we passed point pedro we noticed many signs of activity among the shrimpcatchers and well into san pablo bay we observed a widely scattered fleet of upper bay fishingboats hastily pulling in their nets and getting up sail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was suspicious enough to warrant investigation and the first and only boat we succeeded in boarding proved to have an illegal net <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the law permitted no smaller mesh for catching shad than one that measured seven and onehalf inches inside the knots while the mesh of this particular net measured only three inches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a flagrant breach of the rules and the two fishermen were forthwith put under arrest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neil partington took one of them with him to help manage the reindeer while charley and i went on ahead with the other in the captured boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the shad fleet had headed over toward the petaluma shore in wild flight and for the rest of the run through san pablo bay we saw no more fishermen at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our prisoner a bronzed and bearded greek sat sullenly on his net while we sailed his craft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a new columbia river salmon boat evidently on its first trip and it handled splendidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even when charley praised it our prisoner refused to speak or to notice us and we soon gave him up as a most unsociable fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we ran up the carquinez straits and edged into the bight at turners shipyard for smoother water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here were lying several english steel sailing ships waiting for the wheat harvest and here most unexpectedly in the precise place where we had captured big alec we came upon two italians in a skiff that was loaded with a complete chinese sturgeon line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surprise was mutual and we were on top of them before either they or we were aware <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley had barely time to luff into the wind and run up to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ran forward and tossed them a line with orders to make it fast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the italians took a turn with it over a cleat while i hastened to lower our big spritsail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this accomplished the salmon boat dropped astern dragging heavily on the skiff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley came forward to board the prize but when i proceeded to haul alongside by means of the line the italians cast it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we at once began drifting to leeward while they got out two pairs of oars and rowed their light craft directly into the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this manoeuvre for the moment disconcerted us for in our large and heavily loaded boat we could not hope to catch them with the oars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but our prisoner came unexpectedly to our aid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his black eyes were flashing eagerly and his face was flushed with suppressed excitement as he dropped the centreboard sprang forward with a single leap and put up the sail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive always heard that greeks dont like italians charley laughed as he ran aft to the tiller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and never in my experience have i seen a man so anxious for the capture of another as was our prisoner in the chase that followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes fairly snapped and his nostrils quivered and dilated in a most extraordinary way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley steered while he tended the sheet and though charley was as quick and alert as a cat the greek could hardly control his impatience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the italians were cut off from the shore which was fully a mile away at its nearest point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did they attempt to make it we could haul after them with the wind abeam and overtake them before they had covered an eighth of the distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they were too wise to attempt it contenting themselves with rowing lustily to windward along the starboard side of a big ship the lancashire queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but beyond the ship lay an open stretch of fully two miles to the shore in that direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this also they dared not attempt for we were bound to catch them before they could cover it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so when they reached the bow of the lancashire queen nothing remained but to pass around and row down her port side toward the stern which meant rowing to leeward and giving us the advantage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we in the salmon boat sailing close on the wind tacked about and crossed the ships bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then charley put up the tiller and headed down the port side of the ship the greek letting out the sheet and grinning with delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the italians were already halfway down the ships length but the stiff breeze at our back drove us after them far faster than they could row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> closer and closer we came and i lying down forward was just reaching out to grasp the skiff when it ducked under the great stern of the lancashire queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chase was virtually where it had begun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the italians were rowing up the starboard side of the ship and we were hauled close on the wind and slowly edging out from the ship as we worked to windward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they darted around her bow and began the row down her port side and we tacked about crossed her bow and went plunging down the wind hot after them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and again just as i was reaching for the skiff it ducked under the ships stern and out of danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it went around and around the skiff each time just barely ducking into safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time the ships crew had become aware of what was taking place and we could see their heads in a long row as they looked at us over the bulwarks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each time we missed the skiff at the stern they set up a wild cheer and dashed across to the other side of the lancashire queen to see the chase to windward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they showered us and the italians with jokes and advice and made our greek so angry that at least once on each circuit he raised his fist and shook it at them in a rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they came to look for this and at each display greeted it with uproarious mirth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tork about yer marine hippodromes if this aint one id like to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who says the dagoes wont win <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the next tack to windward the greek offered to change places with charley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leta me saila de boat he demanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fixa them i catcha them sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a stroke at charleys professional pride for pride himself he did upon his boatsailing abilities but he yielded the tiller to the prisoner and took his place at the sheet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three times again we made the circuit and the greek found that he could get no more speed out of the salmon boat than charley had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> better give it up one of the sailors advised from above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the greek scowled ferociously and shook his fist in his customary fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meanwhile my mind had not been idle and i had finally evolved an idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep going charley one time more i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as we laid out on the next tack to windward i bent a piece of line to a small grappling hook i had seen lying in the bailhole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the end of the line i made fast to the ringbolt in the bow and with the hook out of sight i waited for the next opportunity to use it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more they made their leeward pull down the port side of the lancashire queen and once more we churned down after them before the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nearer and nearer we drew and i was making believe to reach for them as before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stern of the skiff was not six feet away and they were laughing at me derisively as they ducked under the ships stern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that instant i suddenly arose and threw the grappling iron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it caught fairly and squarely on the rail of the skiff which was jerked backward out of safety as the rope tautened and the salmon boat ploughed on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a groan went up from the row of sailors above which quickly changed to a cheer as one of the italians whipped out a long sheathknife and cut the rope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we had drawn them out of safety and charley from his place in the sternsheets reached over and clutched the stern of the skiff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole thing happened in a second of time for the first italian was cutting the rope and charley was clutching the skiff when the second italian dealt him a rap over the head with an oar charley released his hold and collapsed stunned into the bottom of the salmon boat and the italians bent to their oars and escaped back under the ships stern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the greek took both tiller and sheet and continued the chase around the lancashire queen while i attended to charley on whose head a nasty lump was rapidly rising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our sailor audience was wild with delight and to a man encouraged the fleeing italians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley sat up with one hand on his head and gazed about him sheepishly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will never do to let them escape now he said at the same time drawing his revolver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on our next circuit he threatened the italians with the weapon but they rowed on stolidly keeping splendid stroke and utterly disregarding him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont stop ill shoot charley said menacingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this had no effect nor were they to be frightened into surrendering even when he fired several shots dangerously close to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was too much to expect him to shoot unarmed men and this they knew as well as we did so they continued to pull doggedly round and round the ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well wear them out and wind them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twenty times more we ran them around the lancashire queen and at last we could see that even their iron muscles were giving out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were nearly exhausted and it was only a matter of a few more circuits when the game took on a new feature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the row to windward they always gained on us so that they were halfway down the ships side on the row to leeward when we were passing the bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this last time as we passed the bow we saw them escaping up the ships gangway which had been suddenly lowered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an organized move on the part of the sailors evidently countenanced by the captain for by the time we arrived where the gangway had been it was being hoisted up and the skiff slung in the ships davits was likewise flying aloft out of reach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the parley that followed with the captain was short and snappy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he absolutely forbade us to board the lancashire queen and as absolutely refused to give up the two men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time charley was as enraged as the greek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only had he been foiled in a long and ridiculous chase but he had been knocked senseless into the bottom of his boat by the men who had escaped him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knock off my head with little apples he declared emphatically striking the fist of one hand into the palm of the other if those two men ever escape me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill stay here to get them if it takes the rest of my natural life and if i dont get them then i promise you ill live unnaturally long or until i do get them or my names not charley le grant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then began the siege of the lancashire queen a siege memorable in the annals of both fishermen and fish patrol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the reindeer came along after a fruitless pursuit of the shad fleet charley instructed neil partington to send out his own salmon boat with blankets provisions and a fishermans charcoal stove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by sunset this exchange of boats was made and we said goodby to our greek who perforce had to go into benicia and be locked up for his own violation of the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after supper charley and i kept alternate fourhour watches till daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fishermen made no attempt to escape that night though the ship sent out a boat for scouting purposes to find if the coast were clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the next day we saw that a steady siege was in order and we perfected our plans with an eye to our own comfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dock known as the solano wharf which ran out from the benicia shore helped us in this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened that the lancashire queen the shore at turners shipyard and the solano wharf were the corners of a big equilateral triangle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from ship to shore the side of the triangle along which the italians had to escape was a distance equal to that from the solano wharf to the shore the side of the triangle along which we had to travel to get to the shore before the italians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as we could sail much faster than they could row we could permit them to travel about half their side of the triangle before we darted out along our side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we allowed them to get more than halfway they were certain to beat us to shore while if we started before they were halfway they were equally certain to beat us back to the ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found that an imaginary line drawn from the end of the wharf to a windmill farther along the shore cut precisely in half the line of the triangle along which the italians must escape to reach the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this line made it easy for us to determine how far to let them run away before we bestirred ourselves in pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> day after day we would watch them through our glasses as they rowed leisurely along toward the halfway point and as they drew close into line with the windmill we would leap into the boat and get up sail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sight of our preparation they would turn and row slowly back to the lancashire queen secure in the knowledge that we could not overtake them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to guard against calms when our salmon boat would be useless we also had in readiness a light rowing skiff equipped with spoon oars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at such times when the wind failed us we were forced to row out from the wharf as soon as they rowed from the ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the nighttime on the other hand we were compelled to patrol the immediate vicinity of the ship which we did charley and i standing fourhour watches turn and turn about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the italians however preferred the daytime in which to escape and so our long night vigils were without result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what makes me mad said charley is our being kept from our honest beds while those rascally lawbreakers are sleeping soundly every night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but much good may it do them he threatened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill keep them on that ship till the captain charges them board as sure as a sturgeons not a catfish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a tantalizing problem that confronted us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as we were vigilant they could not escape and as long as they were careful we would be unable to catch them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley cudgelled his brains continually but for once his imagination failed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a problem apparently without other solution than that of patience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a waiting game and whichever waited the longer was bound to win <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to add to our irritation friends of the italians established a code of signals with them from the shore so that we never dared relax the siege for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besides this there were always one or two suspiciouslooking fishermen hanging around the solano wharf and keeping watch on our actions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could do nothing but grin and bear it as charley said while it took up all our time and prevented us from doing other work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the days went by and there was no change in the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that no attempts were made to change it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night friends from the shore came out in a skiff and attempted to confuse us while the two italians escaped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that they did not succeed was due to the lack of a little oil on the ships davits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for we were drawn back from the pursuit of the strange boat by the creaking of the davits and arrived at the lancashire queen just as the italians were lowering their skiff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another night fully half a dozen skiffs rowed around us in the darkness but we held on like a leech to the side of the ship and frustrated their plan till they grew angry and showered us with abuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley laughed to himself in the bottom of the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a good sign lad he said to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when men begin to abuse make sure theyre losing patience and shortly after they lose patience they lose their heads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mark my words if we only hold out theyll get careless some fine day and then well get them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they did not grow careless and charley confessed that this was one of the times when all signs failed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their patience seemed equal to ours and the second week of the siege dragged monotonously along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then charleys lagging imagination quickened sufficiently to suggest a ruse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter boyelen a new patrolman and one unknown to the fisherfolk happened to arrive in benicia and we took him into our plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were as secret as possible about it but in some unfathomable way the friends ashore got word to the beleaguered italians to keep their eyes open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the night we were to put our ruse into effect charley and i took up our usual station in our rowing skiff alongside the lancashire queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after it was thoroughly dark peter boyelen came out in a crazy duck boat the kind you can pick up and carry away under one arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we heard him coming along paddling noisily we slipped away a short distance into the darkness and rested on our oars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> opposite the gangway having jovially hailed the anchor watch of the lancashire queen and asked the direction of the scottish chiefs another wheat ship he awkwardly capsized himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man who was standing the anchorwatch ran down the gangway and hauled him out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was what he wanted to get aboard the ship and the next thing he expected was to be taken on deck and then below to warm up and dry out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the captain inhospitably kept him perched on the lowest gangway step shivering miserably and with his feet dangling in the water till we out of very pity rowed in from the darkness and took him off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jokes and gibes of the awakened crew sounded anything but sweet in our ears and even the two italians climbed up on the rail and laughed down at us long and maliciously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats all right charley said in a low voice which i only could hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im mighty glad its not us thats laughing first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well save our laugh to the end eh lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clapped a hand on my shoulder as he finished but it seemed to me that there was more determination than hope in his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have been possible for us to secure the aid of united states marshals and board the english ship backed by government authority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the instructions of the fish commission were to the effect that the patrolmen should avoid complications and this one did we call on the higher powers might well end in a pretty international tangle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second week of the siege drew to its close and there was no sign of change in the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the morning of the fourteenth day the change came and it came in a guise as unexpected and startling to us as it was to the men we were striving to capture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley and i after our customary night vigil by the side of the lancashire queen rowed into the solana wharf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the name of reason and common sense what is that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all unmannerly craft did you ever see the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well might he exclaim for there tied up to the dock lay the strangest looking launch i had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that it could be called a launch either but it seemed to resemble a launch more than any other kind of boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was seventy feet long but so narrow was it and so bare of superstructure that it appeared much smaller than it really was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was built wholly of steel and was painted black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three smokestacks a good distance apart and raking well aft arose in single file amidships while the bow long and lean and sharp as a knife plainly advertised that the boat was made for speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> passing under the stern we read streak painted in small white letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley and i were consumed with curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few minutes we were on board and talking with an engineer who was watching the sunrise from the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was quite willing to satisfy our curiosity and in a few minutes we learned that the streak had come in after dark from san francisco that this was what might be called the trial trip and that she was the property of silas tate a young mining millionaire of california whose fad was highspeed yachts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was some talk about turbine engines direct application of steam and the absence of pistons rods and cranks all of which was beyond me for i was familiar only with sailing craft but i did understand the last words of the engineer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four thousand horsepower and fortyfive miles an hour though you wouldnt think it he concluded proudly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley exclaimed in an excited voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four thousand horsepower and fortyfive miles an hour the engineer repeated grinning goodnaturedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there any way i can speak to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that moment a young man in blue uniform came on deck farther aft and stood regarding the sunrise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he is thats him thats mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley walked aft and spoke to him and while he talked earnestly the young man listened with an amused expression on his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must have inquired about the depth of water close in to the shore at turners shipyard for i could see charley making gestures and explaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few minutes later he came back in high glee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on to the dock with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was our good fortune to leave the streak when we did for a little later one of the spy fishermen appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley and i took up our accustomed places on the stringerpiece a little ahead of the streak and over our own boat where we could comfortably watch the lancashire queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing occurred till about nine oclock when we saw the two italians leave the ship and pull along their side of the triangle toward the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley looked as unconcerned as could be but before they had covered a quarter of fortyfive miles an hour  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly the two men rowed along till they were nearly in line with the windmill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the point where we always jumped into our salmon boat and got up the sail and the two men evidently expecting it seemed surprised when we gave no sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were directly in line with the windmill as near to the shore as to the ship and nearer the shore than we had ever allowed them before they grew suspicious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we followed them through the glasses and saw them standing up in the skiff and trying to find out what we were doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spy fisherman sitting beside us on the stringerpiece was likewise puzzled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not understand our inactivity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men in the skiff rowed nearer the shore but stood up again and scanned it as if they thought we might be in hiding there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a man came out on the beach and waved a handkerchief to indicate that the coast was clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they bent to the oars to make a dash for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not until they had covered threequarters of the distance from the lancashire queen which left them hardly more than a quarter of a mile to gain the shore did charley slap me on the theyre ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we ran the few steps to the side of the streak and jumped aboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stern and bow lines were cast off in a jiffy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the streak shot ahead and away from the wharf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spy fisherman we had left behind on the stringerpiece pulled out a revolver and fired five shots into the air in rapid succession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men in the skiff gave instant heed to the warning for we could see them pulling away like mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if they pulled like mad i wonder how our progress can be described <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so frightful was the speed with which we displaced the water that a wave rose up on either side our bow and foamed aft in a series of three stiff upstanding waves while astern a great crested billow pursued us hungrily as though at each moment it would fall aboard and destroy us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the streak was pulsing and vibrating and roaring like a thing alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind of our progress was like a gale a fortyfivemile gale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could not face it and draw breath without choking and strangling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it blew the smoke straight back from the mouths of the smokestacks at a direct right angle to the perpendicular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact we were travelling as fast as an express train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we just streaked it was the way charley told it afterward and i think his description comes nearer than any i can give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the italians in the skiff hardly had we started it seemed to me when we were on top of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally we had to slow down long before we got to them but even then we shot past like a whirlwind and were compelled to circle back between them and the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had rowed steadily rising from the thwarts at every stroke up to the moment we passed them when they recognized charley and me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that took the last bit of fight out of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hauled in their oars and sullenly submitted to arrest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well charley neil partington said as we discussed it on the wharf afterward i fail to see where your boasted imagination came into play this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but charley was true to his hobby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he demanded pointing to the streak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the invention of that isnt imagination i should like to know what is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course he added its the other fellows imagination but it did the work all the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps our most laughable exploit on the fish patrol and at the same time our most dangerous one was when we rounded in at a single haul an even score of wrathful fishermen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley called it a coop having heard neil partington use the term but i think he misunderstood the word and thought it meant coop to catch to trap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fishermen however coup or coop must have called it a waterloo for it was the severest stroke ever dealt them by the fish patrol while they had invited it by open and impudent defiance of the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during what is called the open season the fishermen might catch as many salmon as their luck allowed and their boats could hold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was one important restriction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from sundown saturday night to sunup monday morning they were not permitted to set a net <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a wise provision on the part of the fish commission for it was necessary to give the spawning salmon some opportunity to ascend the river and lay their eggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this law with only an occasional violation had been obediently observed by the greek fishermen who caught salmon for the canneries and the market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one sunday morning charley received a telephone call from a friend in collinsville who told him that the full force of fishermen was out with its nets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley and i jumped into our salmon boat and started for the scene of the trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a light favoring wind at our back we went through the carquinez straits crossed suisun bay passed the ship island light and came upon the whole fleet at work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but first let me describe the method by which they worked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the net used is what is known as a gillnet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has a simple diamond shaped mesh which measures at least seven and onehalf inches between the knots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from five to seven and even eight hundred feet in length these nets are only a few feet wide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are not stationary but float with the current the upper edge supported on the surface by floats the lower edge sunk by means of leaden this arrangement keeps the net upright in the current and effectually prevents all but the smaller fish from ascending the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the salmon swimming near the surface as is their custom run their heads through these meshes and are prevented from going on through by their larger girth of body and from going back because of their gills which catch in the mesh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it requires two fishermen to set such a net one to row the boat while the other standing in the stern carefully pays out the net <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it is all out stretching directly across the stream the men make their boat fast to one end of the net and drift along with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we came upon the fleet of lawbreaking fishermen each boat two or three hundred yards from its neighbors and boats and nets ive only one regret lad and that is that i havent a thousand arms so as to be able to catch them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it is well only be able to catch one boat for while we are tackling that one it will be up nets and away with the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we drew closer we observed none of the usual flurry and excitement which our appearance invariably produced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead each boat lay quietly by its net while the fishermen favored us with not the slightest attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can it be they dont recognize us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said that it was impossible and charley agreed yet there was a whole fleet manned by men who knew us only too well and who took no more notice of us than if we were a hay scow or a pleasure yacht <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this did not continue to be the case however for as we bore down upon the nearest net the men to whom it belonged detached their boat and rowed slowly toward the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the boats showed no sign of uneasiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we can confiscate the net at any rate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we lowered sail picked up one end of the net and began to heave it into the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the first heave we heard a bullet zip zipping past us on the water followed by the faint report of a rifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men who had rowed ashore were shooting at us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the next heave a second bullet went zipping past perilously near <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley took a turn around a pin and sat down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as soon as he began to heave in the shooting recommenced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that settles it he said flinging the end of the net overboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you fellows want it worse than we do and you can have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we rowed over toward the next net for charley was intent on finding out whether or not we were face to face with an organized defiance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we approached the two fishermen proceeded to cast off from their net and row ashore while the first two rowed back and made fast to the net we had abandoned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at the second net we were greeted by rifle shots till we desisted and went on to the third where the manoeuvre was again repeated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we gave it up completely routed and hoisted sail and started on the long windward beat back to benicia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a number of sundays went by on each of which the law was persistently violated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet short of an armed force of soldiers we could do nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fishermen had hit upon a new idea and were using it for all it was worth while there seemed no way by which we could get the better of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about this time neil partington happened along from the lower bay where he had been for a number of weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with him was nicholas the greek boy who had helped us in our raid on the oyster pirates and the pair of them took a hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was planned that while charley and i tackled the nets they were to be hidden ashore so as to ambush the fishermen who landed to shoot at us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we reckoned not half so well as the greeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they forestalled us by ambushing neil and nicholas and taking them prisoners while as of old bullets whistled about our ears when charley and i attempted to take possession of the nets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we were again beaten off neil partington and nicholas were released <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were rather shamefaced when they put in an appearance and charley chaffed them unmercifully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but neil chaffed back demanding to know why charleys imagination had not long since overcome the difficulty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just you wait the ideall come all right charley promised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im afraid the salmon will be exterminated first and then there will be no need for it when it does come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neil partington highly disgusted with his adventure departed for the lower bay taking nicholas with him and charley and i were left to our own resources <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this meant that the sunday fishing would be left to itself too until such time as charleys idea happened along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i puzzled my head a good deal to find out some way of checkmating the greeks as also did charley and we broached a thousand expedients which on discussion proved worthless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fishermen on the other hand were in high feather and their boasts went up and down the river to add to our discomfiture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among all classes of them we became aware of a growing insubordination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were beaten and they were losing respect for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the loss of respect contempt began to arise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley began to be spoken of as the olda woman and i received my rating as the peewee kid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the situation was fast becoming unbearable and we knew that we should have to deliver a stunning stroke at the greeks in order to regain the oldtime respect in which we had stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then one morning the idea came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were down on steamboat wharf where the river steamers made their landings and where we found a group of amused longshoremen and loafers listening to the hard luck tale of a sleepyeyed young fellow in long seaboots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a sort of amateur fisherman he said fishing for the local market of berkeley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now berkeley was on the lower bay thirty miles away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the previous night he said he had set his net and dozed off to sleep in the bottom of the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next he knew it was morning and he opened his eyes to find his boat rubbing softly against the piles of steamboat wharf at benicia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he saw the river steamer apache lying ahead of him and a couple of deckhands disentangling the shreds of his net from the paddlewheel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in short after he had gone to sleep his fishermans riding light had gone out and the apache had run over his net <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though torn pretty well to pieces the net in some way still remained foul and he had had a thirtymile tow out of his course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley nudged me with his elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i grasped his thought on the we cant charter a steamboat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lets run over to turners shipyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive something in my mind there that may be of use to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and over we went to the shipyard where charley led the way to the mary rebecca lying hauled out on the ways where she was being cleaned and overhauled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a scowschooner we both knew well carrying a cargo of one hundred and forty tons and a spread of canvas greater than other schooner on the bay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how dye do ole charley greeted a big blueshirted swede who was greasing the jaws of the main gaff with a piece of pork rind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ole grunted puffed away at his pipe and went on greasing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> touchetts claims to consideration were founded on that distribution of effects which is the wonder of those who admire a highly cultivated country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third lady of the trio which glennards fancy had put to such unflattering uses was bound by circumstances to support the claims of the other two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dresham the wife of the editor of the radiator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dresham was a lady who had rescued herself from social obscurity by assuming the role of her husbands exponent and interpreter and dreshams leisure being devoted to the cultivation of remarkable women his wifes attitude committed her to the public celebration of their remarkableness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the conceivable tedium of this duty mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dresham was repaid by the fact that there were people who took her for a remarkable woman and who in turn probably purchased similar distinction with the small change of her reflected importance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to the other ladies of the party they were simply the wives of some of the menthe kind of women who expect to be talked to collectively and to have their questions left unanswered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armiger the latest embodiment of dreshams instinct for the remarkable was an innocent beauty who for years had distilled dulness among a set of people now selfcondemned by their inability to appreciate her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under dreshams tutelage she had developed into a thoughtful woman who read his leaders in the radiator and bought the books he recommended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a new novel appeared people wanted to know what mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armiger thought of it and a young gentleman who had made a trip in touraine had recently inscribed to her the widemargined result of his explorations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard leaning back with his head against the rail and a slit of fugitive blue between his halfclosed lids vaguely wished she wouldnt spoil the afternoon by making people talk though he reduced his annoyance to the minimum by not listening to what was said there remained a latent irritation against the general futility of words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wifes gift of silence seemed to him the most vivid commentary on the clumsiness of speech as a means of intercourse and his eyes had turned to her in renewed appreciation of this finer faculty when mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armigers voice abruptly brought home to him the underrated potentialities of language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve read them of course mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard her ask and in reply to alexas vague interrogationwhy the aubyn lettersits the only book people are talking of this week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armiger says the books in the air one breathes it in like the influenza <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard sat motionless watching his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it hasnt reached the suburbs yet she said with her unruffled smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh do let me come to you then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> touchett cried anything for a change of air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im positively sick of the book and i cant put it down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you sail us beyond its reach mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> literature travels faster than steam nowadays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the worst of it is that we cant any of us give up reading its as insidious as a vice and as tiresome as a virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe it is a vice almost to read such a book as the letters said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the womans soul absolutely torn up by the rootsher whole self laid bare and to a man who evidently didnt care who couldnt have cared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mean to read another line its too much like listening at a keyhole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if she wanted it published <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do we know she did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i heard shed left the letters to the manwhoever he is with directions that they should be published after his death i dont believe it mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why you dont suppose if he were alive he could ever hold up his head again with these letters being read by everybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must have been horrible enough to know theyd been written to him but to publish them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no man could have done it and no woman could have told him to oh come come dresham judicially interposed after all theyre not loveletters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothats the worst of it theyre unloved letters mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then obviously she neednt have written them whereas the man poor devil could hardly help receiving them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps he counted on the public to save him the trouble of reading them said young hartly who was in the cynical stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armiger turned her reproachful loveliness to dresham <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the way you defend him i believe you know who he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everyone looked at dresham and his wife smiled with the superior air of the woman who is in her husbands professional secrets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what have i said to defend him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you called him a poor devilyou pitied him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man who could let margaret aubyn write to him in that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you must know who he is cried mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armiger with a triumphant air of penetration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hartly and flamel laughed and dresham shook his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one knows not even the publishers so they tell me at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they tell you to tell us hartly astutely amended and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armiger added with the appearance of carrying the argument a point farther but even if hes dead and shes dead somebody must have given the letters to the publishers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little bird probably said dresham smiling indulgently on her deduction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little bird of prey thena vulture i should say another man interpolated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh im not with you there said dresham easily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those letters belonged to the public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can any letters belong to the public that werent written to the public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well these were in a sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a personality as big as margaret aubyns belongs to the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a mind is part of the general fund of thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the penalty of greatnessone becomes a monument historique <end> <end> 
<start> <start> posterity pays the cost of keeping one up but on condition that one is always open to the public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see that that exonerates the man who gives up the keys of the sanctuary as it were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh nobody i fancythe letterbox the slit in the wall through which the letters passed to posterity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she never meant them for posterity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a woman shouldnt write such letters if she doesnt mean them to be published <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shouldnt write them to such a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never keep letters said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armiger under the obvious impression that she was contributing a valuable point to the discussion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a general laugh and flamel who had not spoken said lazily you women are too incurably subjective <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i venture to say that most men would see in those letters merely their immense literary value their significance as documents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the personal side doesnt count where theres so much else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh we all know you havent any principles mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armiger declared and alexa glennard lifting an indolent smile said i shall never write you a loveletter mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such talk was as tedious as the buzzing of gnats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered why his wife had wanted to drag him on such a senseless expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hated flamels crowd and what business had flamel himself to interfere in that way standing up for the publication of the letters as though glennard needed his defence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard turned his head and saw that flamel had drawn a seat to alexas elbow and was speaking to her in a low tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other groups had scattered straying in twos along the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it came over glennard that he should never again be able to see flamel speaking to his wife without the sense of sick mistrust that now loosened his joints <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexa the next morning over their early breakfast surprised her husband by an unexpected request <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you bring me those letters from town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said putting down his cup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt himself as helplessly vulnerable as a man who is lunged at in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the book they were all talking about yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard carefully measuring his second cup of tea said with deliberation i didnt know you cared about that sort of thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was in fact not a great reader and a new book seldom reached her till it was so to speak on the home stretch but she replied with a gentle tenacity i think it would interest me because i read her life last year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> someone lent it to me when it came outmr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his first impulse was to exclaim why the devil do you borrow books of flamel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can buy you all you want but he felt himself irresistibly forced into an attitude of smiling compliance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flamel always has the newest books going hasnt he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must be careful by the way about returning what he lends you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes rather crotchety about his library <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh im always very careful she said with a touch of competence that struck him and she added as he caught up his hat dont forget the letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why had she asked for the book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was her sudden wish to see it the result of some hint of flamels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought turned glennard sick but he preserved sufficient lucidity to tell himself a moment later that his last hope of selfcontrol would be lost if he yielded to the temptation of seeing a hidden purpose in everything she said and did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much flamel guessed he had no means of divining nor could he predicate from what he knew of the man to what use his inferences might be put <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very qualities that had made flamel a useful adviser made him the most dangerous of accomplices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard felt himself agrope among alien forces that his own act had set in motion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexa was a woman of few requirements but her wishes even in trifles had a definiteness that distinguished them from the fluid impulses of her kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that having once asked for the book she would not forget it and he put aside as an ineffectual expedient his momentary idea of applying for it at the circulating library and telling her that all the copies were out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the book was to be bought it had better be bought at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left his office earlier than usual and turned in at the first bookshop on his way to the train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the showwindow was stacked with conspicuously lettered volumes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> margaret aubyn flashed back at him in endless repetition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he plunged into the shop and came on a counter where the name reiterated itself on row after row of bindings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to have driven the rest of literature to the back shelves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he caught up a copy tossing the money to an astonished clerk who pursued him to the door with the unheeded offer to wrap up the volumes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the street he was seized with a sudden apprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what if he were to meet flamel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called a cab and drove straight to the station where amid the palmleaf fans of a perspiring crowd he waited a long halfhour for his train to start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had thrust a volume in either pocket and in the train he dared not draw them out but the detested words leaped at him from the folds of the evening paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air seemed full of margaret aubyns name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the motion of the train set it dancing up and down on the page of a magazine that a man in front of him was reading <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the door he was told that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard was still out and he went upstairs to his room and dragged the books from his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they lay on the table before him like live things that he feared to touch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length he opened the first volume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a familiar letter sprang out at him each word quickened by its glaring garb of type <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little broken phrases fled across the page like wounded animals in the open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a battue of helpless things driven savagely out of shelter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not known it would be like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he understood now that at the moment of selling the letters he had viewed the transaction solely as it affected himself as an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise presentable record <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had scarcely considered the act in relation to margaret aubyn for death if it hallows also makes innocuous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennards god was a god of the living of the immediate the actual the tangible all his days he had lived in the presence of that god heedless of the divinities who below the surface of our deeds and passions silently forge the fatal weapons of the dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a knock roused him and looking up he saw his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he met her glance in silence and she faltered out are you ill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they told me you were out and i came upstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the books lay between them on the table he wondered when she would see them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lingered tentatively on the threshold with the air of leaving his explanation on his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not the kind of woman who could be counted on to fortify an excuse by appearing to dispute it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard asked moving forward so that he obstructed her vision of the books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walked over to the dreshams for tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant think what you see in those people he said with a shrug adding uncontrollablyi suppose flamel was there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he left on the yacht this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an answer so obstructing to the natural escape of his irritation left glennard with no momentary resource but that of strolling impatiently to the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as her eyes followed him they lit on the books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he answered over his shoulder for a woman who never reads you make the most astounding exceptions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her smile was an exasperating concession to the probability that it had been hot in town or that something had bothered him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean its not nice to want to read the book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not nice to publish it certainly but after all im not responsible for that am i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused and as he made no answer went on still smiling i do read sometimes you know and im very fond of margaret aubyns books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was reading pomegranate seed when we first met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was then you told me all about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard had turned back into the room and stood staring at his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he repeated and with the words remembrance came to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had found miss trent one afternoon with the novel in her hand and moved by the lovers fatuous impulse to associate himself in some way with whatever fills the mind of the beloved had broken through his habitual silence about the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rewarded by the consciousness of figuring impressively in miss trents imagination he had gone on from one anecdote to another reviving dormant details of his old hillbridge life and pasturing his vanity on the eagerness with which she received his reminiscences of a being already clothed in the impersonality of greatness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the incident had left no trace in his mind but it sprang up now like an old enemy the more dangerous for having been forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the instinct of selfpreservationsometimes the most perilous that man can exercisemade him awkwardly declareoh i used to see her at peoples houses that was all and her silence as usual leaving room for a multiplication of blunders he added with increased indifference i simply cant see what you can find to interest you in such a book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to consider this intently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i glanced at iti never read such things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it true that she didnt wish the letters to be published <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard felt the sudden dizziness of the mountaineer on a narrow ledge and with it the sense that he was lost if he looked more than a step ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure i dont know he said then summoning a smile he passed his hand through her arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt have tea at the dreshams you know wont you give me some now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that evening glennard under pretext of work to be done shut himself into the small study opening off the drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he gathered up his papers he said to his wife youre not going to sit indoors on such a night as this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she had drawn her armchair to the lamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to look at my book she said taking up the first volume of the letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard with a shrug withdrew into the study <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to shut the door i want to be quiet he explained from the threshold and she nodded without lifting her eyes from the book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sank into a chair staring aimlessly at the outspread papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how was he to work while on the other side of the door she sat with that volume in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door did not shut her outhe saw her distinctly felt her close to him in a contact as painful as the pressure on a bruise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sensation was part of the general strangeness that made him feel like a man waking from a long sleep to find himself in an unknown country among people of alien tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we live in our own souls as in an unmapped region a few acres of which we have cleared for our habitation while of the nature of those nearest us we know but the boundaries that march with ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the points in his wifes character not in direct contact with his own glennard now discerned his ignorance and the baffling sense of her remoteness was intensified by the discovery that in one way she was closer to him than ever before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as one may live for years in happy unconsciousness of the possession of a sensitive nerve he had lived beside his wife unaware that her individuality had become a part of the texture of his life ineradicable as some growth on a vital organ and he now felt himself at once incapable of forecasting her judgment and powerless to evade its effects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to escape the next morning the confidences of the breakfast table he went to town earlier than usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife who read slowly was given to talking over what she read and at present his first object in life was to postpone the inevitable discussion of the letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this instinct of protection in the afternoon on his way uptown guided him to the club in search of a man who might be persuaded to come out to the country to dine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only man in the club was flamel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard as he heard himself almost involuntarily pressing flamel to come and dine felt the full irony of the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to use flamel as a shield against his wifes scrutiny was only a shade less humiliating than to reckon on his wife as a defence against flamel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt a contradictory movement of annoyance at the latters ready acceptance and the two men drove in silence to the station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they passed the bookstall in the waitingroom flamel lingered a moment and the eyes of both fell on margaret aubyns name conspicuously displayed above a counter stacked with the familiar volumes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall be late you know glennard remonstrated pulling out his watch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to get something glennard turned on his heel and walked down the platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flamel rejoined him with an innocentlooking magazine in his hand but glennard dared not even glance at the cover lest it should show the syllables he feared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train was full of people they knew and they were kept apart till it dropped them at the little suburban station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they strolled up the shaded hill glennard talked volubly pointing out the improvements in the neighborhood deploring the threatened approach of an electric railway and screening himself by a series of reflex adjustments from the imminent risk of any allusion to the letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flamel suffered his discourse with the bland inattention that we accord to the affairs of someone elses suburb and they reached the shelter of alexas teatable without a perceptible turn toward the dreaded topic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flamel always at his best in alexas presence gave her the kind of attention which is like a beaconing light thrown on the speakers words his answers seemed to bring out a latent significance in her phrases as the sculptor draws his statue from the block <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard under his wifes composure detected a sensibility to this manoeuvre and the discovery was like the lightningflash across a nocturnal landscape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus far these momentary illuminations had served only to reveal the strangeness of the intervening country each fresh observation seemed to increase the sumtotal of his ignorance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her simplicity of outline was more puzzling than a complex surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one may conceivably work ones way through a labyrinth but alexas candor was like a snowcovered plain where the road once lost there are no landmarks to travel by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dinner over they returned to the veranda where a moon rising behind the old elm was combining with that complaisant tree a romantic enlargement of their borders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went to his study to fetch them and in passing through the drawingroom he saw the second volume of the letters lying open on his wifes table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he picked up the book and looked at the date of the letter she had been reading <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was one of the last  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew the few lines by heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dropped the book and leaned against the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why had he included that one among the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or was it possible that now they would all seem like that  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexas voice came suddenly out of the dusk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may touchett was rightit is like listening at a keyhole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i hadnt read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flamel returned in the leisurely tone of the man whose phrases are punctuated by a cigarette it seems so to us perhaps but to another generation the book will be a classic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it ought not to have been published till it had become a classic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its horrible its degrading almost to read the secrets of a woman one might have known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she added in a lower tone stephen did know her did he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew her very well at hillbridge years ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the book has made him feel dreadfully  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt want me to read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt understand at first but now i can see how horribly disloyal it must seem to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its so much worse to surprise a friends secrets than a strangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh glennards such a sensitive chap flamel said easily and alexa almost rebukingly rejoined if youd known her im sure youd feel as he does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard stood motionless overcome by the singular infelicity with which he had contrived to put flamel in possession of the two points most damaging to his case the fact that he had been a friend of margaret aubyns and that he had concealed from alexa his share in the publication of the letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to a man of less than flamels astuteness it must now be clear to whom the letters were addressed and the possibility once suggested nothing could be easier than to confirm it by discreet research <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an impulse of selfaccusal drove glennard to the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not anticipate betrayal by telling his wife the truth in flamels presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the man had a drop of decent feeling in him such a course would be the surest means of securing his silence and above all it would rid glennard of the necessity of defending himself against the perpetual criticism of his wifes belief in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the impulse was strong enough to carry him to the window but there a reaction of defiance set in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what had he done after all to need defence and explanation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both dresham and flamel had in his hearing declared the publication of the letters to be not only justifiable but obligatory and if the disinterestedness of flamels verdict might be questioned dreshams at least represented the impartial view of the man of letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to alexas words they were simply the conventional utterance of the nice woman on a question already decided for her by other nice women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had said the proper thing as mechanically as she would have put on the appropriate gown or written the correct form of dinnerinvitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard had small faith in the abstract judgments of the other sex he knew that half the women who were horrified by the publication of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aubyns letters would have betrayed her secrets without a scruple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sudden lowering of his emotional pitch brought a proportionate relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told himself that now the worst was over and things would fall into perspective again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wife and flamel had turned to other topics and coming out on the veranda he handed the cigars to flamel saying cheerfullyand yet he could have sworn they were the last words he meant to utter!look here old man before you go down to newport you must come out and spend a few days with usmustnt he alexa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard had perhaps unconsciously counted on the continuance of this easier mood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had always taken pride in a certain robustness of fibre that enabled him to harden himself against the inevitable to convert his failures into the building materials of success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though it did not even now occur to him that what he called the inevitable had hitherto been the alternative he happened to prefer he was yet obscurely aware that his present difficulty was one not to be conjured by any affectation of indifference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some griefs build the soul a spacious housebut in this misery of glennards he could not stand upright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it pressed against him at every turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told himself that this was because there was no escape from the visible evidences of his act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people who had never opened a book discussed them with critical reservations to have read them had become a social obligation in circles to which literature never penetrates except in a personal guise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was from the unexpected discovery of his own pettiness that he chiefly suffered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our selfesteem is apt to be based on the hypothetical great act we have never had occasion to perform and even the most self scrutinizing modesty credits itself negatively with a high standard of conduct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard had never thought himself a hero but he had been certain that he was incapable of baseness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we all like our wrongdoings to have a becoming cut to be made to order as it were and glennard found himself suddenly thrust into a garb of dishonor surely meant for a meaner figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the immediate result of his first weeks of wretchedness was the resolve to go to town for the winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that such a course was just beyond the limit of prudence but it was easy to allay the fears of alexa who scrupulously vigilant in the management of the household preserved the american wifes usual aloofness from her husbands business cares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard felt that he could not trust himself to a winters solitude with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had an unspeakable dread of her learning the truth about the letters yet could not be sure of steeling himself against the suicidal impulse of avowal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his very soul was parched for sympathy he thirsted for a voice of pity and comprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he found himself brought up abruptly against his incredible ignorance of her nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact that he knew well enough how she would behave in the ordinary emergencies of life that he could count in such contingencies on the kind of high courage and directness he had always divined in her made him the more hopeless of her entering into the torturous psychology of an act that he himself could no longer explain or understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have been easier had she been more complex more feminineif he could have counted on her imaginative sympathy or her moral obtusenessbut he was sure of neither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sure of nothing but that for a time he must avoid her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard could not rid himself of the delusion that by and by his action would cease to make its consequences felt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not have cared to own to himself that he counted on the dulling of his sensibilities he preferred to indulge the vague hypothesis that extraneous circumstances would somehow efface the blot upon his conscience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his worst moments of selfabasement he tried to find solace in the thought that flamel had sanctioned his course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flamel at the outset must have guessed to whom the letters were addressed yet neither then nor afterward had he hesitated to advise their publication <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this thought drew glennard to him in fitful impulses of friendliness from each of which there was a sharper reaction of distrust and aversion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when flamel was not at the house he missed the support of his tacit connivance when he was there his presence seemed the assertion of an intolerable claim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early in the winter the glennards took possession of the little house that was to cost them almost nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the change brought glennard the immediate relief of seeing less of his wife and of being protected in her presence by the multiplied preoccupations of town life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexa who could never appear hurried showed the smiling abstraction of a pretty woman to whom the social side of married life has not lost its novelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard with the recklessness of a man fresh from his first financial imprudence encouraged her in such little extravagances as her good sense at first resisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since they had come to town he argued they might as well enjoy themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took a sympathetic view of the necessity of new gowns he gave her a set of furs at christmas and before the new year they had agreed on the obligation of adding a parlourmaid to their small establishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> providence the very next day hastened to justify this measure by placing on glennards breakfastplate an envelope bearing the name of the publishers to whom he had sold mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened to be the only letter the early post had brought and he glanced across the table at his wife who had come down before him and had probably laid the envelope on his plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not the woman to ask awkward questions but he felt the conjecture of her glance and he was debating whether to affect surprise at the receipt of the letter or to pass it off as a business communication that had strayed to his house when a check fell from the envelope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the royalty on the first edition of the letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his first feeling was one of simple satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the money had come with such infernal opportuneness that he could not help welcoming it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before long too there would be more he knew the book was still selling far beyond the publishers previsions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put the check in his pocket and left the room without looking at his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the way to his office the habitual reaction set in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the money he had received was the first tangible reminder that he was living on the sale of his selfesteem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought of material benefit had been overshadowed by his sense of the intrinsic baseness of making the letters known now he saw what an element of sordidness it added to the situation and how the fact that he needed the money and must use it pledged him more irrevocably than ever to the consequences of his act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to him in that first hour of misery that he had betrayed his friend anew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when that afternoon he reached home earlier than usual alexas drawingroom was full of a gayety that overflowed to the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flamel for a wonder was not there but dresham and young hartly grouped about the teatable were receiving with resonant mirth a narrative delivered in the fluttered staccato that made mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armigers conversation like the ejaculations of a startled aviary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused as glennard entered and he had time to notice that his wife who was busied about the teatray had not joined in the laughter of the men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh go on go on young hartly rapturously groaned and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> armiger met glennards inquiry with the deprecating cry that really she didnt see what there was to laugh at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure i feel more like crying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what i should have done if alexa hadnt been home to give me a cup of tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my nerves are in shredsyes another dear please and as glennard looked his perplexity she went on after pondering on the selection of a second lump of sugar why ive just come from the reading you knowthe reading at the waldorf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rather suspect that youknowwho may be dont let that disturb you pursued stanley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mana singing teacherhis names eugene jennings will call on you this afternoon at three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do she had intended to tell baird frankly that she thought indeed knew that it was highly dangerous for him to enter into her affairs in any way and to urge him to draw off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt that it was only fair to act so toward one who had been unselfishly generous to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now that the time for speaking had come she found herself unable to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only by flatly refusing to have anything to do with his project could she prevail upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to say less than that she had completely and finally changed her mind would sound and would be insincere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that she could not say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt how noble it would be to say this how selfish and weak too it was to cling to him possibly to involve him in disagreeable and even dangerous complications but she had no strength to do what she would have denounced another as base for not doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of the lofty words that flow so freely from the lips of stage and fiction heroines instead of the words that any and every reader of this history would doubtless have why not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> came instantly back over the wire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a very very relentless man replied she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre not going back on the career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was simply giving you a chance to free yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt sure of him now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she scrambled toward the heights of moral grandeur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive no right to ask you to involve yourself in my misfortunes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodby and he rang off that she might have no chance on impulse to do herself mischief with her generous thoughtfulness for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt rather mean but not nearly so mean as she would have felt had she let the opportunity go by with no generous word said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and no doubt my aversion for that little wretch thought she makes me think him more terrible than he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all what can he do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> watch meand discover jennings came exactly at threecame with the air of a man who wastes no ones time and lets no one waste his time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a youngish man of forty or there abouts with a long sharp nose a large tight mouth and eyes that seemed to be looking restlessly about for money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that they had not looked in vain seemed to be indicated by such facts as that he came in a private brougham and that he was most carefully dressed apparently with the aid of a valet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss stevens he said with an abrupt bow before mildred had a chance to speak you have come to new york to take singing lessonsto prepare yourself for the stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you wish a comfortable place to live and to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he extended his gloved hand shook hers frigidly dropped it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall get onif you work but only if you work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not waste myself upon triflers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew a card from his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will go to see the lady whose name and address are written on this card i think you will find the quarters thank you said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come to memy address is on the card also at halfpast ten on saturday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will then lay out if you find i have a voice worth while mildred ventured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he gave the abrupt foreign bow and while mildred was still struggling with her surprise and confusion she saw him through the window driving rapidly away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belloc came drifting through the room she had the habit of looking about whenever there were new visitors and in her it was not irritating because her interest was innocent and sympathetic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what an extraordinary nose he had replied she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i noticed that said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was the only thing i did notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a singing teacher hes the best known singing teacher in new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i simply cant take from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive heard his income is fifty thousand a year what with lessons and coaching and odds and ends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a lot of them that do well because so many fool women with nothing to do cultivate their voiceswhen they cant sing a little bit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see how any teacher can put fifteen dollars of value into half an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i suppose he does or he wouldnt get it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still his may be just another case of new york nerve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the biggest bluff town in the world i do believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here you can get away with anything i as there was no reason for delay and many reasons against it mildred went at once to the address on the card jennings had left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howell brindley installed in a plain comfortable apartment in fiftyninth street overlooking the park and high enough to make the noise of the traffic endurable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a swedish maid prepossessingly white and clean ushered her into the little drawingroom which was furnished with more simplicity and individual taste than is usual anywhere in new york cursed of the mania for useless and tasteless showiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no messy draperies no fussy statuettes vases gilt boxes and the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred awaited the entrance of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently in came a quietlydressed franklooking woman of a young forty a woman who had by no means lost her physical freshness but had gained charm of another and more enduring kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she came forward with extended i was expecting you mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings did not say when i was to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley hastened to assure her that her visit was quite convenient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must have someone to share the expense of this apartment with me and i want the matter settled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings has explained about you to me and now that ive seen you here she smiled charminglyi am ready to say that it is for you to mildred did not know how to begin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley with appeal in her troubled young eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you no doubt wish to know something about me said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my husband was a composer a friend of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am here in new york to teach the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the lessons will bring with my small income will enable me to liveif i can find someone to help out at the expenses here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i understand it you are willing to pay forty dollars a week i to run the house pay all the bills and so onall of course if you wish to come mildred made a not very successful attempt to conceal her embarrassment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps you would like to look at the apartment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tour of the apartmenttwo bedrooms dining room kitchen sittingroom large bathroom drawing roomtook only a few minutes but mildred and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley contrived to become much better acquainted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said mildred when they were in the drawingroom its most attractivejust what i should like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she colored slightly and spoke with the nervousness of one not in the habit of discussing money matters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not see how i could oh i think that is most reasonable interrupted mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley gave an almost childlike sigh of relief and smiled radiantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been so nervous about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at mildred with friendly understanding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you and i are somewhat alike about practical things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve not had much experience either have you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i judge so from the fact that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings is looking after everything ive had no experience at all said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im wondering if i can mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings wished to fix it at sixty a week but i insisted that forty was enough said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings says it is all right youll let me know tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can telephone yes ill let you know tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> andi think we we can help each other said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i i want to be that way said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall be its the only sure happinessto care for something for some thing said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people die or disappoint one or become estranged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when one centers on some kind of work it gives pleasure i am so afraid i havent voice enough or of the right kind said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings is going to try me on saturday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really ive no right to settle mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley smiled with her eyes only and mildred wondered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he should say that i wouldnt do she went on but hell not say that said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you then youll be accepted by him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it will take that will not matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll sing better than at mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how would he live if he did that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a teachers business to teach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if teachers taught only those who could and would learn how would then ill not know whether ill do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have to find out for yourself said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for example ive known jennings who is a very good judge to be wrongboth ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hesitatingly why not sing for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id like to would you tell me what you honestly thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then itd be useless to sing for you said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not vain about my voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id simply like to make a living by it if i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill even confess that there are many things i care for more than for music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does that prove that i can never sing no indeed mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itd be strange if a girl of your age cared exclusively for music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passion comes with the work with progress success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some of the greatestthat is the most famous and best paidsingers never care much about music except as a vanity and never understand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a singer means a person born with a certain shape of mouth and throat a certain kind of vocal chords <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest may be natural or acquired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the instrument do let me sing for you said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think between them they chose a little french song chanson dantonineand mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley insisted on her playing her own accompaniment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish to mildred was surprised at her own freedom from nervousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sang neither better nor worse than usual sang in the clear and pleasant soprano which she flattered herself was not unmusical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she finished she thats about as i usually sing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley reflected before she replied i believe its worth trying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were you i should keep on mildred was instantly depressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know he will not replied mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not as long as you can pay for the lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was thinking of the real thingof whether you could win and you dont think i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary i believe you can replied mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a singer means so much besides singing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the singing is the smallest part of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll understand when you get to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred who had her share of vanity had hoped for some enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleys judicial tone was a severe blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt a little resentful began to cast about for vanityconsoling reasons for mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she means well she said to herself but shes probably just a tiny bit jealous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes not so young as she once was and she hasnt the faintest hope mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley showed that she had more than an inkling of mildreds frame of mind by going on to say in a gentle candid way i want to help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i shall be careful not to encourage you to believe too much in what you have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would prevent you from getting what you need <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must remember you are no longer a drawingroom singer but a candidate for mildred saw that she was mistaken that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley was honest and frank and had doubtless told her the exact truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never be fore had anyone said any less of her singing than that it was wonderful marvelous equal to a great deal that passed for fine in grand opera <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had known that this was exaggeration but she had not known how grossly exaggerated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus this her first experience of the professional attitude was galling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only her unusual good sense saved her from being angry with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was that same good sense that moved her presently to try to laugh at herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a brave you dont realize how youve taken me down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no idea i was so conceited about my singing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant truthfully say i like your frankness but theres a part of me thats grateful to you for it and when i get over feeling hurt ill be grateful through and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been waiting and watching to see how you would take my criticism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the testhow they take criticism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they dont take it at all theyll not go very far no matter how talented they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they take it as youve taken it theres hopegreat hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now im not afraid to tell you that you sang splendidly for an dont spoil it all said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were not for grand opera not for comic opera even replied mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you will sing and sing you really mean that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you work intelligently and persistently said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a big ifas youll discover youll see said mildred confidently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleys smile had a certain sadness in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bellocs a telephone message from jennings was awaiting her he would call at a quarterpast eight and would detain miss stevens only a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at eight fifteen exactly he rang the bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time mildred was prepared she refused to be disconcerted by his abrupt manner and by his long sharp nose that seemed to warn away to threaten away even to thrust away any glance seeking to investigate the rest of his face or his personality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him candidly calmly and seeingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with eyes that saw as they had never seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps from the death of her father certainly from the beginning of siddalls courtship mildred had been waking up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a part of our naturethe active and aggressive part that sleeps all our lives long or becomes atrophied if we lead lives of ease and secure dependence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the important part of us toothe part that determines character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing that completed the awakening of mildred was her acquaintance with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that positive and finelypoised lady fascinated her influenced her powerfullygave her just what she needed at the particular moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vital moments in life are not the crises over which shallow people linger but are the moments where we met and absorbed the ideas that enabled us to weather these crises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belloc was one of those vital moments for mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bellocs personalityher look and manner what she said and the way she said itwas a proffer to mildred of invaluable lessons which her awakening character eagerly absorbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw jennings as he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she decided that he was of common origin that his vanity was colossal and aquiver throughout with sensitiveness that he belonged to the familiar type of newyorker who succeeds by bluffing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also she saw or felt a certain sexlessness or indifference to sexand this she later understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men whose occupation compels them constantly to deal with women go to one extreme or the othereither become acutely sensitive to women as women or become utterly indifferent unless their highly discriminated taste is appealed towhich cannot happen often <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings teaching only women because only women spending money they had not earned and could not earn would tolerate his terms and his methods had as much through necessity as through inclination gone to the extreme of lack of interest in all matters of sex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one look at him and the woman who had come with the idea of offering herself in full or part payment for lessons drooped in instinctive discouragement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings hastened to explain to mildred that she need not hesitate about closing with mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your lessons are arranged for said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there has been put in the plaza trust company to your credit the sum of five thousand dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gives you about a hundred dollars a week for your board and other personal expenses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if that is not enough you will let me know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i estimated that it would be enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think it wise for young women entering upon the preparation it is more than enough murmured the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i you can use as little of it as you like interrupted jennings rising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred felt as though she had been caught and exposed in a hypocritical protest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings was holding out something toward her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took it and he went thats your checkbook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bank will send you statements of your account and will notify you when any further sums are added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i have nothing more to do with your affairsexcept of course the artistic sideyour development as a singer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve no said mildred like a primary schoolchild before a formidable teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i make no reduction for lessons wholly or partly missed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the halfhour i shall assign to you belongs to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you do not use it that is your affair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first you will probably be like all womencareless about your appointments coming with lessons unprepared telephoning excuses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you are serious you will soon fall into the routine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall try to be regular murmured mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im on my way to the operahouse said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of my old pupils is appearing in a new role and she is nervous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good once more that swift quiet exit followed almost instantaneously by the sound of wheels rolling away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had she seen such rapidity of motion without loss of dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes hes a fraud she said to herself the idea of a career had now become less indefinite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was still without any attractionnot because of the toil it involved for that made small impression upon her who had never worked and had never seen anyone work but because a career meant cutting herself off from everything she had been brought up to regard as fit and proper for a lady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was ashamed of this she did not admit its existence even to herself and in her talks with baird about the career she had professed exactly the opposite view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet there it wasnor need she have been ashamed of a feeling that is instilled into women of her class from babyhood as part of their ladylike education <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the career had not become definite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could not imagine herself out on a stage in some sort of a costume with a painted face singing before an audience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still the career was less indefinite than when it had no existence beyond stanley bairds enthusiasm and her own whippedup pretense of enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shrank from the actual start but at the same time was eager for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> inaction began to fret her nerves and she wished to be doing something to show her appreciation of stanley bairds generosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley that she would come in the morning and then she told her landlady <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belloc was more than regretful she was distressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said she ive taken a tremendous fancy to you and i hate to give you up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id do most anything mildred explained that her work compelled her to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i were a few years younger and hadnt spent all my energy in teaching school and putting through that marriage id try to get on the stage myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want no you wont said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no more than id come to see you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our lives lie in different directions and in new york that means well never have time to meet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we may be thrown together again some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as ive got a twenty years lease on this house i guess youll have no trouble in finding me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i could look you up through professor yes said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belloc theres a reason why id like to change without anyones knowing what has become of mei mean i understand perfectly said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belloc with a ready sympathy that made mildred appreciate the advantages of the friendship of unconventional knock about people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got no luggage but that bag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill take it up to the grand central station and check it and bring the check back here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can send for it when you but what about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you walk out of here say about half an hour after i go in the taxi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you walk through to the corner of lexington avenue and thirty seventh streetthere arent any cabs to be had there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill be waiting in the taxi and well make a dash up the east side and i can drop you at some quiet place in the park and go onand you can walk to your new mildred expressed her admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plan was carried out as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belloca born genius at all forms of intriguehad evolved it in perfection on the spur of the moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they went up the far east side mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belloc looking back through the little rear window saw a taxi a few blocks behind them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we havent given them the slip yet said she but we will in the park <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they entered the park at east ninetieth street crossed to the west drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bellocs instructions the motorman put on full speed with due regard to the occasional policeman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at a sharp turning near the mall when the taxi could be seen from neither direction he abruptly stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out sprang mildred and disappeared behind the bushes completely screening the walk from the drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once the taxi was underway again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she waiting where the screen of bushes was securely thick saw the taxi that had followed them in the east side flash byin pursuit of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was freeat least until some mischance uncovered her to the little general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleys she im of for the far west and probably shall not be in town again until the early summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the club forwards my mail and repeats telegrams as marked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go in and win and dont hesitate to call on me if you need me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im getting out of the way because its obviously best for the present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she finished her sense of freedom was complete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not realized how uneasy she was feeling about stanley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not doubt his generosity did not doubt that he genuinely intended to leave her free and she believed that his delicacy was worthy of his generosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still she was constantly fearing lest circumstances should thrust them bothas much against his will as hersinto a position in which she would have to choose between seeming not to say being ungrateful and playing the hypocrite perhaps basely with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little general eluded stanley voluntarily removed she was indeed free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now she could work with an un troubled mind could show mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley that intelligent and persistent workher biggest if in all the worldwas in fact a very simple matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not been settled at mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleys many hours before she discovered that not only was she free from all hindrances but was to have a positive and great help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleys talent for putting people at their ease was no mere drawingroom trick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made mildred feel immediately at home as she had not felt at home since her mother introduced james presbury into their house at hanging rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley was absolutely devoid of pretenses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i owe that to my husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was brought up like everybody elseto be more or less of a poser and a hypocrite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact i think there was almost nothing genuine about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my husband taught me to be myself to be afraid of nobodys opinion to show myself just as i was and to let people seek or avoid me as they he must have been a remarkable man said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not attractiveat least not to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we quarreled whenever we were not at work with the music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had not died we should have been divorced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he would have hired me as his musical secretary and wed have mildred was still thinking of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never dared be myself confessed she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know what myself really is like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was thinking the other day how for one reason and another ive been a hypocrite all my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see ive always been a dependenthave always had to you can never be yourself until you have an independent income however small said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive had that joy only since my husband died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its as well that i didnt have it sooner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one is the better for having served an apprenticeship at selfrepression and at pretending to virtues one has not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only those who earn their freedom know how to use it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had had it ten or fifteen years ago id have been an intolerable tyrant making everyone around me unhappy and therefore myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ideal world would be one where everyone was born free and never knew anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then no one being afraid or having to serve everyone would have to be considerate in order to get himself i wonder if i really ever shall be able to earn a living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must decide that whatever you can make shall be for you a living said the older woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have lived on my fixed income which is under two thousand a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i am ready to do it again rather than i shall have to be extremely careful laughed mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley smiled but underneath mildred saw or perhaps feltthat her new friend was indeed not you and i will get on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have to be more or less intimate but well never be after a time she discovered that mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleys first name was cyrilla but mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley and miss stevens they remained to each other for a long timeuntil circumstances changed their accidental intimacy into enduring friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not to anticipate in the course if there is anything about meabout my life i know all i wish to know replied cyrilla brindley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your face and your manner and your way of then you must not think it strange when i say i it will be impossible for you entirely to avoid meeting people said cyrilla <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have some simple explanation about yourself or you will attract attention lead people to believe that im an orphanperhaps of some obscure familywho is trying to get up mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quite enough for new york said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not interested in facts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the newyorker asks of you is can you pay your bills competent men are rare but thanks to the advantage of the male sex in having to make the struggle for a living they are not so rare as competent women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley was the first competent woman mildred had ever known <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had spent but a few hours with her before she began to appreciate what a bad atmosphere she had always breathedbad for a woman who has her way to make in the world or indeed for any woman not willing to be content as mere more or less shiftless more or less hypocritical and pretentious dependent and parasite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleywell bred and well educatedknew all the little matters which mildred had been taught to regard as the whole of a ladys education <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mildred saw that these trifles were but a trifling incident in mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew real things this woman who was a thoroughgoing housekeeper and who trebled her income by giving music lessons a few hours a day to such pupils as she thought worth the teaching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she spoke she always said something one of the first things noticed by mildred who being too lazy to think except as her naturally good mind insisted on exercising itself usually talked simply to kill time and without any idea of getting anywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while cyrillawithout in the least intending itroused her to a painful sense of her own limitations she did not discourage her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred also began to feel that in this new atmosphere of ideas of work of accomplishment she would rapidly develop into a different sort of person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was extremely fortunate for her thought she that she was living with such a person as cyrilla brindley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the old atmosphere or with any taint of it she would have been unable to become a serious person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would simply have dawdled along twaddling about art and seriousness and careers and sacrifice content with the amateurs methods and the amateurs resultsand deluding herself that she was making progress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it was as different as public school from private school public school where the mind is rudely stimulated private school where it is sedulously mollycoddled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had come out of the hothouse into the open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first she thought that jennings was to be as great a help to her as cyrilla brindley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly if ever there was a man with the air of a worker and a place with the air of a workshop that man and that place were eugene jennings and his studio in carnegie hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when mildred entered on that saturday morning at exactly halfpast ten jenningsin a plain if elegant housesuitlooked at her looked at the clock stopped a girl in the midst of a burst of tremulous noisy melody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will do miss bristow said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have never sung it worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another lesson like this and we shall go back and begin all over the girl a fattish temperamental blonde burst into tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kindly take that out into the hall said jennings coldly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cannot waste miss miss bristow switched from tears to fury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shrieked and flung herself out of the room slamming the door after her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings took a book from a pile upon a table opened it and set it on a musicstand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> evidently miss bristow was forgottenindeed had passed out of his mind at halfpast ten exactly not to enter it again until she should appear at ten on monday morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said im a little nervous said mildred with a shy laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont mind id like to wait till ive jennings looked at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the long sharp nose seemed to be rapping her on the forehead like a wood peckers beak on the bark of the tree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> begin he said pointing to the book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall not begin until i can begin said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time to show this man that he could not treat her brutally was at the outset <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings opened the door into the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good day miss stevens he said with his abrupt bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred looked at him he looked at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her lip trembled the hot tears flooded and blinded her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went unsteadily to the musicstand and tried to see the notes of the exercises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings closed the door and seated himself at the far end of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stopped gritted her teeth began again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more the result was absurd but this time she was able to keep on not improving but maintaining her initial offkey quavering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont stop again until i tell you to please said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she staggered and stumbled and somersaulted through two pages of doremefasollasi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he held up his finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> belloc had told her about him what mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings i can do better than that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally she dropped to a chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take the book and go over the same thing sitting said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she began to remove her wraps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as you are he commanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> try to forget what a brute i am and what a wonderful singer you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just she was rosy with rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of three pages he stopped her with an enthusiastic handclapping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill make a singer of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a tall thin woman with many jewels and a superb fur wrap came gliding in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> learn to keep your mouth open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well go into that further next time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was holding the door open for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she passed out she heard him ah mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well go at that third song the door closed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reviewing all that had occurred mildred decided that she must revise her opinion of jennings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moneymaker he no doubt was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did he not have to live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but a teacher also and a great teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had he not destroyed her vanity at one blow demolished it?yet without discouraging her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he went straight to the bottom of things very different from any of the teachers she used to have when she was posing in drawingrooms as a person with a voice equal to the most difficult opera if only she werent a lady and therefore not forced to be a professional singing person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes a great teacherand in deadly earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how she would have to work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she went to work with an energy she would not have believed she possessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he instructed her minutely in how to stand in how to breathe in how to open her mouth and keep it open in how to relax her throat and leave it relaxed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he filled every second of her halfhour she had never before realized how much time half an hour was how use could be made of every one of its eighteen hundred seconds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went to hear other teachers give lessons and she understood why jennings could get such prices could treat his pupils as he saw fit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she became an extravagant admirer of him as a teacher thought him a genius felt confident that he would make a great singer of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the second lesson she began to progress rapidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few weeks she amazed herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last she was really singing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not in a great way but in the beginnings of a great way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her voice had many times the power of her drawingroom days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her notes were full and round and came without an effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her former ideas of what constituted facial and vocal expression now seemed ridiculous to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was now singing without making those dreadful faces which she had once thought charming and necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her lower register always her best was almost perfect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her middle registerthe test part of a voicewas showing signs of strength and steadiness and evenness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she was fast getting a real upper register as distinguished from the forced and shrieky high notes that pass as an upper register with most singers even opera singers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a month of this marvelous forward march she sang for mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleysang the same song she had essayed yes youve done wonders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been noticing your improvement as you practiced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you certainly have a very different voice and method from those you had a month ago and so on through about five minutes of critical and discriminating praise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred listened wondering why her dissatisfaction her irritation increased as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond question cyrilla was sincere and was saying even more than mildred had hoped she would say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet mildred sat moodily measuring off octaves on the keyboard of the piano <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she had been looking at her friends face she would have flared out in anger for cyrilla brindley was taking advantage of her abstraction to observe her with friendly sympathy and sadness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she concealed this candid you are satisfied with your progress arent you mildred flared up angrily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley did not answerperhaps because she thought no answer was needed or expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but to mildred her silence somehow seemed a denial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you can only keep what youve gotand go on said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i shall never fear retorted mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i do fear said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think its always well to fear until success is actually won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then theres the awful fear of not being able to hold after a moments silence mildred who could not hide away resentment against one she liked said why but i am satisfied protested cyrilla <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only it makes me afraid to see you so well satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive seen that often in people first starting and its always dangerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see my dear youve got a straightaway hundred miles to walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you see that it would be possible for you to become too much elated by the way why do you try to discourage me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do it because i want to save you from despair a little later said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that is foolish of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall only irritate you against me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and please dont ask my opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you do i cant help showing exactly what then you dont think ive done well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed you have replied cyrilla warmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill tell you and then ill stop and you must not ask my opinion again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we live too close together to be able to afford to criticize each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i meant was this you have done well the first part of the great task thats before you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you had done it any less that is what ive done doesnt amount to doubtless hes right said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate we all agree that you have shown that you she said this so simply and heartily that mildred could not but be mollified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley changed the subject to the song mildred had sung and mildred stopped puzzling over the mystery of what she had meant by her apparently enthusiastic words which had yet diffused a chill atmosphere of doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was doing her scales so well that she became impatient of such tiresome childs play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and presently jennings gave her songs and did not discourage her when she talked of roles of getting seriously at what after all she intended to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there came a week of vile weather and mildred caught a cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a bad attack of ulcerated sore throat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for nearly three weeks she could not take a single one of the lessons which were nevertheless paid for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a singer has no right to be sick said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have a cold yourself retorted she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am not a singer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive nothing that interferes its impossible not to take cold said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sore throat finally yielded to the treatment of dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his bill was seventy five dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while the swelling in the tonsils subsided it did not depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some days she sang as well as ever and on those days jennings was charming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other days she sang atrociously and jennings treated her as if she were doing it deliberately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a third and worse state was that of the days when she in the same halfhour alternately sang well and badly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on those days jennings acted like a lunatic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he raved up and down the studio all but swearing at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first she was afraid of him withered under his scorn feared he would throw open his door and order her out and forbid her ever to enter again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but gradually she came to understand him not enough to lose her fear of him altogether but enough to lose the fear of his giving up so profitable a pupil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth was that jennings like every man who succeeds at anything in this world operated upon a system to which he rigidly adhered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a man of small talent and knowledge but of great persistence and not a little common sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had tried to be a singer had failed because his voice was small and unreliable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had adopted teaching singing as a means of getting a living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had learned just enough about it to enable him to teach the technical elementswhat is set down in the books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by observing other and older teachers he had got together a teaching system that was as goodand as badas any and this he dubbed the jennings method and proceeded to exploit as the only one worth while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when that method was worked out and perfected he ceased learning ceased to give a thought to the professional side of his profession just as most professional men do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have resented a suggestion or a new idea as an attack upon the jennings method <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the overwhelming majority of the human raceindeed all but a small handfulhave this passion for stagnation this ferocity against change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is in large part due to laziness for a new idea means work in learning it and in unlearning the old ideas that have been true until the unwelcome advent of the new <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in part also this resistance to the new idea arises from a fear that the new idea if tolerated will put one out of business will set him adrift without any means of support <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coachman hates the automobile the handworker hates the machine the orthodox preacher hates the heretic the politician hates the reformer the doctor hates the bacteriologist and the chemist the old woman hates the newall these in varying proportions according to the degree in which the iconoclast attacks laziness or livelihood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally we all hate any and all new ideas because they seem to imply that we who have held the old ideas have been ignorant and stupid in so doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a new idea is an attack upon the vanity of everyone who has been a partisan of the old ideas and their established order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings thoroughly human in thus closing his mind to all ideas about his profession was equally human in that he had his mind and his senses opened full width to ideas on how to make more money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there had been money in new ideas about teaching singing jennings would not have closed to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the money was all in studying and learning how better to handle the womenthey were all women who came to him for instruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his common sense warned him at the outset that the obviously easygoing teacher would not long retain his pupils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the other hand he saw that the really severe teacher would not retain his pupils either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place they were all ignorant for people who already know do not go to school to learn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had the universal delusion that a teacher can teach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact is that a teacher is a well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some wells are full others almost dry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some are so arranged that water cannot be got from them others have attachments of various kinds making the drawing of water more or less easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but not from the best well with the latest pump attachment can one get a drink unless one does the drinking oneself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a teacher is rarely a well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pupil must not only draw the water but also drink it must not only teach himself but also learn what he teaches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now we are all of us born thirsty for knowledge and nearly all of us are born both capable of teaching ourselves and capable of learning what we teach that is of retaining and assimilating it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is such a thing as artificially feeding the mind just as there is such a thing as artificially feeding the body but while everyone knows that artificial feeding of the body is a success only to a limited extent and for a brief period everyone believes that the artificial feeding of the mind is not only the best method but the only method <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor does the discovery that the mind is simply the brain is simply a part of the body subject to the bodys laws seem materially to have lessened this fatuous delusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of jenningss pupilsnot more than two of the fortyodd were in genuine earnest that is those two were educating themselves to be professional singers were determined so to be had limited time and means and endless capacity for work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> others of the forty about halfthought they were serious though in fact the idea of a career was more or less hazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were simply taking lessons and toiling aimlessly along not less aimlessly because they indulged in vague talk and vaguer thought about a career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the restthe other half of the fortywere amusing themselves by taking singing lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it killed time it gave them a feeling of doing something it gave them a reputation of being serious people and not mere idlers it gave them an excuse for neglecting the domestic duties which they regarded as degradingprobably because to do them well requires study and earnest hard work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jennings singing lesson at fifteen dollars a halfhour was rather an expensive hypocrisy but the women who used it as a cloak for idleness as utter as the mere yawners and bridgers and shoppers had rich husbands or fathers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus it appears that the jennings school was a perfect microcosm as the scientists would say of the human racethe serious very few toiling more or less successfully toward a definite goal the many compelled to do something and imagining themselves serious and purposeful as they toiled along toward nothing in par ticular but the next lessonthat is the next days appointed task the utterly idle fancying themselves busy and important when in truth they were simply a fraud and an expense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jennings got very little from the deeply and genuinely serious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them he taught free taking promissory notes for the lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he held on to them because when they finally did teach themselves to sing and arrived at fame his would be part of the gloryand glory meant more and more pupils of the paying kinds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his large income came from the other two kinds of pupils the larger part of it from the kind that had no seriousness in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his problem was how to keep all these paying pupils and also keep his reputation as a teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in solving that problem he evolved a method that was the true jenningss method <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not in all new york filled as it is with people living and living well upon the manipulation of the weaknesses of their fellow beingsnot in all new york was there an adroiter manipulator than eugene jennings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was harsh to brutality when he saw fit to be soor rather when he deemed it wise to be so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet never had he lost a paying pupil through his harshness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were fashionable womenmost delicate sensitive ladiesat whom he swore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wept stayed on advertised him as a wonderful serious teacher who wont stand any nonsense and doesnt care a hang whether you stay or goand he can teach absolutely anybody to sing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew how to be gentle without seeming to be so he knew how to flatter without uttering a single word that did not seem to be reluctant praise or savage criticism he knew how to make a lady with a little voice work enough to make a showing that would spur her to keep on and on with him he knew how to encourage a rich woman with no more song than a peacock until she would come to him three times a week for many yearsand how he did make her pay for what he suffered in listening to the hideous squawkings and yelpings she inflicted upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did jennings think himself a fraud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no more than the next human being who lives by fraud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there any trade or profession whose practitioners in the bottom of their hearts do not think they are living excusably and perhaps creditably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jennings theory was that he was a great teacher that there were only a very few serious and worthwhile seekers of the singing art that in order to live and to teach these few he had to receive the others that anyhow singing was a fine art for anyone to have and taking singing lessons made the worst voice a little less bador at the least singing was splendid for the health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of his favorite dicta was every child should be taught singing for its health if for nothing else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate he made his forty to fifty thousand a yearand on days when he had a succession of the noisy tuneless squawkers he felt that he more than earned every cent of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred did not penetrate far into the secret of the moneymaking branch of the jennings method <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but are not all the frauds that fool the human race crude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> human beings both cannot and will not look beneath surfaces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all mildred learned was that jennings did not give up paying pupils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not confidence enough in this discovery to put it to the test <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not dare disobey him or shirk even when she was most disposed to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but gradually she ceased from that intense application she had at first brought to her work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did all that was asked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to be toiling as in the beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in reality she became by the middle of spring a mere lessontaker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her interest in clothes and in going about revived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw in the newspapers that general siddall had taken a party of friends on a yachting trip around the world so she felt that she was no longer being searched for at least not vigorously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she became acquainted with smart rich west side women taking lessons at jenningss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she amused herself going about with them and with the musical men they attractedamateur and semiprofessional singers and players upon instruments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had little parties at the flat in fiftyninth streetthe most delightful little parties imaginabledinners and suppers music clever conversations flirtations of a harmless but fascinating kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anyone had accused mildred of neglecting her work of forgetting her career she would have grown indignant and if mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley had overheard she would have been indignant for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred worked as much as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was doing all that could be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it takes time to develop a voice to make an operasinger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forcing is dangerous when it is not downright useless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in maytoward the end of the monthstanley baird returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred who happened to be in unusually good voice that day sang for him at the jennings studio and he was enchanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the last note died jennings nodded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes got a voice said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we want to get that upper register right first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and its a young voiceshes very young for her age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must be why whats a voice for if not to sing with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fine voice is a very delicate instrument replied the teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added coldly you must let me judge certainly certainly said stanley in haste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes had several colds this winter and spring pursued jennings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those things are dangerous until the voice has its full growth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she should have two jennings was going away for a two months vacation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was giving this advice to all his pupils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i hate to stop work objected mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to be doing something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im very impatient of and honest she was in this protest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had no idea of the state of her own mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she fancied she was still as eager as ever for the career as intensely interested as ever in her work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not dream of the real meaning of her content with her voice as it was of her lack of uneasiness over the appalling fact that such voice as she had was unreliable came and went for no apparent reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> absolute rest for two months declared jennings mildred gave a resigned sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is much inveighing against hypocrisy a vice unsightly rather than desperately wicked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the excitement about it its dangerous even deadly near kinsman selfdeception escapes unassailed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seven cardinal sins but what of the eighth?the parent of all the others the one beside which the children seem almost white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the first few weeks mildred had been careful about spending money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> economy she did not understand how could she when she had never had a lesson in it or a valuable hint about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only way in which such people can keep order in their finances is by not spending any money at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this so long as she gave her whole mind to her work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after the first great cold so depressing so subtly undermining she began to go about to think of to need and to buy clothes to spend money in a dozen necessary ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all she was simply borrowing the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she would be making a career would be earning large sums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would pay back everything with interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stanley meant for her to use the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really she ought to use it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how would her career be helped by her going about looking a dowd and a frump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had always been used to the comforts of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she deprived herself of them she would surely get into a frame of mind where her work would suffer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she must lead the normal life of a woman of her class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to work all the timewhy as jennings said that took away all the freshness made one stale and unfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little distractionalways of course with musical people people who talked and thought and did musicthat sort of distraction was quite as much a part of her education as the singing lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley certainly a sensible and serious woman if ever there was onemrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley believed so and it must be so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that illness and before she began to go about she had fallen into several fits of hideous blues had been in despair as to the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as she saw something of peoplealways the valuable musical sort of peopleher spirits improved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she got a few new dressesvery simple and inexpensive but stylish and charmingand the hats too were successful as soon as she was freshly arrayed she was singing better and was talking hopefully of the career again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes it was really necessary that she live as she had always been used to living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when stanley came back her account was drawn up to the last cent of the proportionate amount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact it might have been a few dollarsa hundred or so overdrawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still that was a small matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the summer she would spend less and by fall she would be far ahead againand ready to no indeed cried she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been living within the hundred a weekor nearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why three or four nights of singing will i suppose i will make a lot of money said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it doesnt seem real to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hastily added i dont mean the career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can hardly wait to begin at the roles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i never earned well youll have plenty of it in two or three years said stanley confidently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you mustnt try to live like girls whove been brought up to hardship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt necessary and it would only unfit you for your i think thats true said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ive enough more than enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave him a nervous shy almost agonized look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please dont try to put me please dont talk nonsense about obligation retorted he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets get away from this subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont seem to realize that youre doing me a favor that its a privilege to be allowed to help develop such a marvelous voice as yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scores of people would jump that doesnt lessen my obligation said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she thought she meant it though in fact his generous and plausible statement of the case had immediately lessened not a little her sense of obligation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the whole however she was not sorry she had this chance to talk of obligation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly as they saw each other from time to time often alone stanley had begunperhaps in spite of himself and unconsciously to show his feeling for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes his hand accidentally touched hers and he did not draw it away as quickly as he might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and sheit was impossible for her to make any gesture much less say anything that suggested sensitiveness on her part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would put him in an awkward position would humiliate him most unjustly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell into the habit of holding her hand longer than was necessary at greeting or parting of touching her caressingly of looking at her with the eyes of a lover instead of a friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not like these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some mysterious reasonfrom sheer perversity she thoughtshe had taken a strong physical dislike to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perfectly absurd for there was nothing intrinsically repellent about this handsome clean most attractively dressed man of the best type of american and newyorker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no only perversity could explain such a silly notion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was always afraid he would try to take advantage of her delicate positionalways afraid she would have to yield something some trifle yet the idea of giving anything from a sense of obligation was galling to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his very refraining made her more nervous the more shrinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he would only commit some overt actseize her kiss her make outrageous demandsbut this refrain ing these touches that might be accidental and again might be stealthy approach she hated to have him shake hands with her would have liked to draw away when his clothing chanced to brush against hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she was glad of the talk about obligation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it set him at a distance immediately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ceased to look lovingly to indulge in the nerverasping little caresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was evidently eager to prove the sincerity of his protestationstoo eager perhaps her perverse mind suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still sincere or not he held to all the forms of sincerity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleys who were going abroad offered her their cottage on the new jersey coast near seabright and a big new touringcar and chauffeur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and mildred at once gave up the plan for a summer in the adirondacks the more readily as several of the men and women they saw the most of lived within easy distance of them at deal beach and elberon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when mildred went shopping she was lured into buying a lot of summer things she would not have needed in the adirondacksa mere matter of two hundred and fifty dollars or thereabouts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little additional economy in the fall would soon make up for such a trifle and if there is one time more than another when a woman wishes to look well and must look well that time is summerespecially by the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when her monthly statement from the bank came on the first of july she found that five thousand dollars had been deposited to her credit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was moved by this discovery to devote several hoursvery depressed hours they wereto her finances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had spent a great deal more money than she had thought indeed since march she had been living at the rate of fifteen thousand a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tried to account for this amazing extravagance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she could recall no expenditure that was not really almost if not quite necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took a frightful lot of money to live in new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how did people with small incomes manage to get along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever would have become of her if she had not had the good luck to be able to borrow from stanley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would become of her if before she was succeeding on the stage stanley should die or lose faith in her or interest in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been living these last few months among people who had wideopen eyes and knew everything that was going onand did some goingon themselves as she was now more than suspecting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were many women thousands of themamong the attractive costily dressed throngs she saw in the carriages and autos and cabswho would not like to have it published how they contrived to live so luxuriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no they would not like to have it published though they cared not a fig for its being whispered new york too thoroughly understood how necessary luxurious living was and was too completely divested of the follies of the oldfashioned straightlaced morality to mind little shabby details of queer conduct in striving to keep up with the procession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the married women using their husbandsand letting their husbands use themdid not frown on the irregularities of their sisters less fortunately married or not able to find a permanent leg to pull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the girlsmildred had observed strange things in the lives of the girls she knew more or less well nowadays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact all the women of all classes and conditions were engaged in the same mad struggle to get hold of money to spend upon fun and finerya struggle matching in recklessness and resoluteness the struggle of the men downtown for money for the same purposes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was curious this double mania of the men and the womenthe mania to get money no matter how the instantly succeeding mania to get rid of it no matter how <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking about her mildred felt that she was peculiar and apart from nearly all the women she knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not degrade herself did not sell herself did not wheedle or cajole or pretend in the least degree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had grown more liberal as her outlook on life had widened with contact with the new york mindno with the mind of the whole easygoing luxurymad moralityscorning modern world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she still kept her standard for herself high and believed in a purity for herself which she did not exact or expect in her friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this respect she and cyrilla brindley were sympathetically alike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no mildred was confident that in no circumstances in no circumstances would she relax her ideas of what she personally could do and could not do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that she blamed or judged at all women who did as she would not but she could not simply could not however hard she might be driven do those things though she could easily understand how other women did them in preference to sinking down into the working class or eking out a frowsy existence in some poor boardinghouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank heaven it was not teasing her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would what if stanley baird should lose interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what if after he lost interest she should find herself without money worse of than she had been when she sold herself into slaveryhighly moral and conventionally correct slavery but still slaveryto the little general with the peaked pinksilk nightcap hiding the absence of the removed toupeeand with the wonderful pinksilk pajamas gorgeously monogramed in violet and the tiny feet and ugly handsand those loathsome needlepointed mustaches and the hideous habit of mumbling his tongue and smacking his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what if moneyless she should not be able to find another stanley or a man of the class gentleman willing to help her generously even on any terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was looking out over the sea her bankbook and statements and canceled checks in her lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their cottage was at the very edge of the strand its veranda was often damp from spray after a storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not storming as she sat there taking stock under a blue sky an almost tranquil sea was crooning softly in the sunlight innocent and happy and playful as a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dressed in a charming negligee and looking forward to a merry day in the auto with lunch and dinner at attractive luxurious places farther down the coast she was stricken with a horrible sadness with a terror that made her heart beat wildly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never earned a dollar with my voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for two months it has been unreliable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im acting like a crazy just then stanley baird came through the pretty little house seeking her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do hastily she flung a scarf over the book and papers in her lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had intended to speak to him about that fresh deposit of five thousand dollarsto refuse it to rebuke him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the wine at dinner last night explained she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought never to touch red wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it disagrees with that was filthy stuff said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must take she stealthily wound the scarf about the papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she felt that all were secure she rose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was looking sweet and sad and peculiarly beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an exquisite sheen on her skin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had washed her hair that morning and it was straying fascinatingly about her brow and ears and neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baird looked at her lowered his eyes and colored <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill not be long she said hurriedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had to pass him in the rather narrow doorway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from her garments shook a delicious perfume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he caught her in his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blood had flushed into his face in a torrent swelling out the veins giving him a distorted and wild expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say that you love me a she grew cold with fear and with repulsion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she neither yielded to his embrace nor shook it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she simply stood her round smooth body hard though corsetless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kissed her on the throat kissed the lace over her bosom crying out inarticulately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the frenzy of his passion he did not for a while realize her lack of response <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he felt it his arms relaxed dropped away from her fell at his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was breathing so heavily that she glanced into the house apprehensively fearing someone else might hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were too much for me this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are she moved on into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got something to say she turned and went back to the veranda he retreating before her and his eyes sinking before the cold clear blue of hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre going up not to come down again he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how glad she was that he had so misread her thoughts had not discovered the fear the weakness the sudden collapse of all her boasted confidence in her strength of character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll never feel the same toward me again he went fatuously on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill admit that i am in love with youhave been ever since the steameralways was crazy about that mouth of yoursand your figure and the sound of your voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill admit im an utter fool about yourespect you and trust you as i never used to think any woman deserved to be respected and trusted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill even admit that ive been hopingall sorts of things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew a woman like you wouldnt let a man help her unless at this her heart beat wildly and a blush of shame poured over her face and neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not the courage to look at herto face that expression of the violated goddess he felt confident her face was wearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in love he reasoned and felt about her like an inexperienced boy all his experience going i understand we can never be anything to each other until youre on the stage and arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id not have it otherwise if i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i want you and id never the color was fading from her cheeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this it flushed deeper than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not to speak was to lie was to play the hypocrite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least stanley baird was better than siddall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow who was she that had been the wife of siddall to be so finicky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you i hope not she said gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i and she went into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked after her in admiration of the sweet and pure calm of this quiet rebuke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tried to take the same exalted view of it herself but she could not fool herself just then with the familiar good woman fake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew that she had struck the flag of selfrespect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew what she would really have done had he been less delicate less in love and more practical <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she found a small and poor consolation in reflecting i wonder how many women there are who take high ground because it costs nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are prone to suspect everybody of any weakness we find in ourselvesand perhaps we are not so far wrong as are those who accept without question the noisy protestations of a world of selfdeceivers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thenceforth she and stanley got on better than ever apparently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but though she ignored it she knew the truthknew her new and deep content was due to her not having challenged his assertion that she loved him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he believing her honest and high minded assumed that the failure to challenge was a good womans way of admitting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but with the day of reckoning not only with him but also with her own self respectput off until that vague and remote time when she should be a successful prima donna she gave herself up to enjoyment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was a summer of rarely fine weather particularly fine along the jersey coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they always in gay partiesmotored up and down the coast and inland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several of the musical men notably richardson of elberonhad plenty of money stanley stopping with his cousins the frasers on the rumson road brought several of his friends all rich and more or less free <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as every moment of mildreds day was full and as it was impossible not to sleep and sleep well in that ocean air with the surf soothing the nerves as the lullaby of a nurse soothes a baby she was able to put everything unpleasant out of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was resting her voice was building up her health therefore the career was being steadily advanced and no time was being wasted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt sorry for those who had to do unpleasant or disagreeable things in making their careers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told herself that she did not deserve her good fortune in being able to advance to a brilliant career not through hardship but over the most delightful road imaginableamusing herself wearing charming and satisfactory clothes swimming and dancing motoring and feasting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without realizing it she was strongly under the delusion that she was herself already richthe inevitable delusion with a woman when she moves easily and freely and luxuriously about never bothered for money always in the company of rich people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rich are fated to demoralize those around them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stingy rich fill their satellites with envy and hatred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the generous rich fill them with the feeling that the light by which they shine and the heat with which they are warm are not reflected light and heat but their own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had she been so happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she even did not especially mind donald keith a friend of stanleys and of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleys who much too often to suit her made one of the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had tried in vain to discover what there was in keith that inspired such intense liking in two people so widely different as expansive and emotional stanley baird and reserved and distinctly cold cyrilla brindley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keith talked little not only seemed not to listen well but showed plainly even in teteatete conversations that his thoughts had been elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made no pretense of being other than he wasan indifferent man who came because it did not especially matter to him where he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes his silence and his indifference annoyed mildred againthanks to her profound and reckless contentmentshe was able to forget that he was along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to be and probably was about forty years old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his head was beautifully shaped the line of its profilefront top and backbeing perfect in intellectuality strength and symmetry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was rather under the medium height about the same height as mildred herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was extremely thin and loosely built and his clothes seemed to hang awry giving him an air of slovenliness which became surprising when one noted how scrupulously neat and clean he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his brown hair considerably tinged with rusty gray grew thinly upon that beautiful head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his skin was dry and smooth and dead white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this taken with the classic regularity of his features gave him an air of lifelessness of one burnt out by the fire of too much living but whether the living had been done by keith himself or by his immediate ancestors appearances did not disclose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this look of passionless motionless repose like classic sculpture was sharply and startlingly belied by a pair of really wonderful eyes deeply and intensely blue brilliant all seeing all comprehending eyes that seemed never to sleep seemed the ceaselessly industrious servants of a brain that busied itself without pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the contrast between the dead white calm of his face the listlessness of his relaxed figure and these vivid eyes so intensely alive gave to donald keiths personality an uncanniness that was most disagreeable to mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what fascinates me said cyrilla when they were discussing him one day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes tiresome he is the only man ive ever seen with whom i could imagine myself falling in love said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve never lived with a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she forgot completely as did mildred herself so completely had mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> siddall returned to the modes and thoughts of a girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at hometo live withyou want only reposeful things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is why the greeks whose instincts were unerring had so much reposeful statuary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one grows weary of agitating objects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they soon seem hysterical and shallow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the same things true of persons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for permanent love and friendship you want reposeful men calm strong silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other kind either wear you you forget his eyes put in stanley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did you yes those eyes of his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley did not seize the opportunity to convict i admit the eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre the eyes of the kind of man a woman wants or another man wants in his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when keith looks at you you feel that you are seeing the rarest being in the worldan absolutely reliable person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i think of him i think of reliable just i had no idea it was so serious as this teased stanley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor had i returned cyrilla easily until i began to talk about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baird or he the idea amused stanley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he doesnt care a rap about women said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hear he has let a few care about him from time to time but he soon ceased to as he came just then they had to find another subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred observed him with more interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had learned to have respect for mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she soon gave over watching him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that profound calm those eyes concentrating all the life of the man like a burning glass she had a disagreeable sense of being seen through even to her secretest thought of being understood and measured and weighed and found wanting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it occurred to her for the first time that part of the reason for her not liking him was the best of reasonsthat he did not like her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first time she was left alone with him after this discovery she happened to be in an audacious and talkative mood and his lack of response finally goaded her into saying why dont you like me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cared nothing about it she simply wished to hear what he would sayif he could be roused into saying anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sitting on the steps leading from the veranda to the seawas smoking a cigarette and gazing out over the waves like a graven image as if he had always been posed there and always would be there the embodiment of repose gazing in ineffable indifference upon the embodiment of its opposite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked you why you do not like me said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rose extended his case then a light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was never remiss in those kinds of politeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she was smoking he seated himself again and dropped into the former attitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she eyed him wondering how it could be possible that he had endured the incredible fatigues and hardships stanley baird had related of himhunting and exploring expeditions into tropics and into frozen regions mountain climbs wild sea voyages in small boats all with no sign of being able to stand anything yet also with no sign of being any more disturbed than now in this seaside laziness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stanley had showed them a picture of him taken twenty years and more ago when he was in college he had looked almost the same thenperhaps a little older <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i am waiting persisted she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought he was about to look at hera thing he had never done to her knowledge since they had known each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she nerved herself to receive the shock with a certain flutter of expectancy of excitement even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but instead of looking he settled himself in a slightly different position and fixed his gaze upon another point in the horizon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she noted that he had splendid handsideal hands for a man with the same suggestion of intense vitality and aliveness that flashed from his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not noted this before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next she saw that he had good feet and that his boots were his only article of apparel that fitted him or rather that looked as if made for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tossed her cigarette over the rail to the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he startled her by speaking in his unemotional way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cigarette depending listlessly from his lips seemedas usualuncertain whether it would stay or fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she watched this uncertainty with a curious nervous interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was always thinking that cigarette would fall but it never did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we used to have a pump in our back yard at home laughed she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one toiled away at the handle but nothing ever came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was a promisinglooking he smileda slow reluctant smile but undeniably no said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tone made her feel how absurd it was to suspect him of such provincialism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are rude said she coldly rising to go into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said something what she did not hear in her i said i am not rude but kind replied he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have not liked you but i have been polite to you because of stanley and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should you be insulting to what have i done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had risen as she rose but instead of facing her he was leaning against the post of the veranda bent upon his seaward vigil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have insinuated that your reasons for not liking you insisted said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was amazed at her wild unaccountable rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slowly turned his head and looked at hera glance without any emotion whatever simply a look that like the beam of a powerful searchlight seemed to thrust through fog and darkness and to light up no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never mindi dont know what im saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she went hastily into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later in her own room upstairs she was wondering at herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what had she seenor half seenin the darkness and fog within but he did not stay away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he owned and lived in a small house up on the rumson road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the house was little more than a bungalow and had a simplicity that completely hid its rare good taste from the average observer its grounds were the most spacious in that neighborhood of costly showy houses set in grounds not much more extensive than a city building lot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grounds had been cleared and drained to drive out and to keep out the obnoxious insect life but had been left a forest concealing the house from the roads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stanley baird was now stopping with keith and brought him along to the cottage by the sea every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the parties narrowed to the same four persons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley seemed never to tire of talking to keith or to tire of talking about him when the two men had left late each night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for stanley he referred everything to keiththe weather prospects where they should go for the day what should be eaten and drunk any point about politics or fashion life or literature or what not that happened to be discussed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he looked upon donalds monosyllabic reply to his inquiry as a final judgment ending all possibility of argument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then in spite of herself she began to yield ceased to dislike him found a kind of pleasureor perhaps fascinated interestin the nervousness his silent and indifferent presence caused her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she liked to watch that immobile perfect profile neither young nor old indeed not suggesting age in any degree but only experience and knowledgeand an infinite capacity for emotion for passion even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deadwhite color declared it had already been lived the brilliant usually averted or veiled eyes asserted present vitality pulsing under a calm surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day when stanley in the manner of one who wishes a thing settled and settled right said he would ask donald keith about it mildred a little piqued thats all assented stanley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thats quite he doesnt pretend to be anything or to know mildred suddenly began to like keith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had never thought of this before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes it was true he did not pretend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not in the least not about anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you saw him you saw at once the worst there was to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was afterward that you discovered he was not slovenly but clean and neat not badly but well dressed not homely but handsome not sickly but soundly well not physically weak but strong not dull but vividly alive not a tiresome void but an unfathomable mystery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cyrillas usually positive gray eyes looked vague <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive known him nearly three years and it never occurred to me to ask or to wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> usually ill ask stanley said mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she did about an hour later when they were in the surf together with hes a lawyer of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also hes written a novel or two and a book of poems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way he makes his a queer kind of lawyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he never goes to court and his clients are almost all other lawyers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they go to him to get him to tell them what to do and what not to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got a big reputation among lawyers fred norman tells me but makes comparatively little as he either cant or wont charge what he ought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him what norman said and he only smiled in that queer way he has <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said you make twenty or thirty thousand a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ought to make ten he said i make all i want <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i took in more id be bothered getting rid of it or investing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can always make all ill wantunless i go crazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what could a crazy man do with money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doesnt cost several items of interest to add to those she had collected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could talk brilliantly but he preferred silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could make himself attractive to women and to men but he preferred to be detached <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could be a great lawyer but he preferred the quiet of obscurity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could be a rich man but he preferred to be comparatively poor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said mildred i suppose some womansome disappointment in lovehas killed ambition and i dont think so replied baird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men who knew him as a boy say he was always as he is now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his father died and he had to come home and support his motheruntil she died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way his whole life has been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drifts in the current of circumstances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might let himself be blown away tomorrow to the other end of the earth and stay away yearsor never come on his wits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as well or as poorly as he cared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes the sort of man everyone instinctively asks advice ofme you his valet the farmer who meets him at a boundary fence the fellow who sits nest him in a mildred did not merely cease to dislike him she went farther and rapidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she began to like him to circle round that tantalizing indolent mystery as a deer about a queer bit of brush in the undergrowth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was alternately afraid to talk before him and recklessly confidentialall with no response or sign of interest from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she was silent when they were alone together he was silent too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she talked still he was silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what did he think of her?that especially <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she interrupted herself to say one afternoon as they sat together on the strand under a big sunshade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been talking on and on about her careertalking conceitedly as her subject intoxicated hertelling him what triumphs awaited her as soon as she should be ready to debut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he i knew you werent listening to me or i shouldnt no i wasnt admitted he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got to believe it said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i didnt she came to a full stop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time he had ever flattered her with interest enough to ask her a question about herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i didnt believe i was going to succeedand succeed big she began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a pause she added or think it said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are always asking me questions to which you already know the answer said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre referring to a week or so ago when i asked no answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no outward sign of interest in anything even in the cigarette drooping from the corner of his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are always asking me questions to which you already know the answer repeated he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you want me to go away and leave you in peace with thatlaw caseor whatever no reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean a dog would be better because it doesnt no reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i have a pleasantsounding voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as im saying nothing it may be soothinglike the sound of the waves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive learned to take you as you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sign that he was even tempted to rise to this bait and protest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you dont like mine she went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ive got to keep it up and to pretend to myself that it isnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why ask these questions ill tell you why replied she her face suddenly flushed with earnestness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i want you to help you never asked me said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know i wanted it until just nowas i said it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must have known because you are so much more experienced than iand understand peoplewhats going on in their minds deeper than they can see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes you must have known i needed your help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you ought to have helped me even if you did dislike me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve no right to dislike anyone as young he was looking at her now the intensely alive blue eyes sympathetic penetrating understanding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was frightful to be so thoroughly understoodall ones weaknesses laid bareyet it was a relief and a joy too she gasped grew ghastly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a frightful insult one for which she was wholly unprepared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another of those questions he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he looked calmly away out over the sea as if his interest in the conversation were at an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for convince him she must and then go away and never permit him to speak to her again until he had apologized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keith you have i do not like kept women either with or without a license said he in the same even indifferent way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you ceased to be a kept woman i would help there was nothing to do but to rise and go away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rose and went toward the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was still inspecting the horizon the cigarette depending mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keith i am sure you did not mean to insult me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another of those questions said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when you have thought you then it would be useless to explain said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is one of those vital things which if one cannot understand them for oneself one is hopelessis beyond another of those questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you had not seen clearly what i meant you would have been really offended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd have gone away and not come she saw that this was true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and seeing she wondered how she could have been so stupid as not to have seen it at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had yet to learn that overlooking the obvious is a universal human failing and that seeing the obvious is the talent and the use of the superior of earththe few who dominate and determine the race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you reproach me for not having helped you he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how does it happen that you are uneasy a light broke upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have been drawing me on from the beginning she cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have been helping memaking me see that i needed no said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been waiting to see whether no he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you may be worth helping or rather worth encouraging she looked at him pathetically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got no money no experience no sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a vain luxuryloving fool cursed with i hope its something more substantial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope he drew in his legs in preparation for risingno doubt to go away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mean that she cried testily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not harsh with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the truth thats harshthe truth im beginning to seeand feel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid that depends said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a way of saying a thing that gave it the full weight of a verdict from which there was no appeal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if you wanted to make a living he went on and if you were determined to learn to sing as well as you could with the idea that you might be able to i dont know she confessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never been able to judge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes i think im singing well and i find out afterward that ive sung badly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again its to learn to judge myself said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never thought of it beforehow important that is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you because he has not taught you that you will never sing until you are your own teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because he has not taught you that singing is a small and minor part but it isnt protested she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking at him she felt that he had dismissed her and her affairs from his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said to bring him back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you said that a singer didnt have to be able to did i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he glanced down the shore toward the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you have thought about your case a while longer well talk of it againif you wish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but until she rose stood staring out to sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was observing why bother about a career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all kept woman is a thoroughly respectable occupationor can be made so by any preacher or justice of the peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its followed by many of our best womenthose who pride themselves on their high charactersand on i could not belong to a man unless i cared for him she sank down upon the sand and burst into a wild passion of sobs and tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when her fight for self control was over and she looked up to apologize for her pitiful exhibition of weaknessand to note whether she had made an impression upon his sympathiesshe saw him just entering the house a quarter of a mile away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to anger succeeded a mood of desperate forlornness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she fell upon herself with gloomy ferocity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was taking moneya disgracefully large amount of money from stanley baird under false pretenses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could she hope to sing when her voice could not be relied upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was not her throat at that very moment slightly sore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it not always going queer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was he waiting for the time when she would gladly accept what she must have from him on his own terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no not on his terms but on the terms she herself would arrange the only terms she could make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no stanley believed in her absolutelybelieved in her career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he discovered the truth he would lose interest in her would regard her as a poor worthless creature would be eager to rid himself of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of returning to the house she went in the opposite direction made a circuit and buried herself in the woods beyond the shrewsbury <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was mad to get away from her own company but the only company she could fly to was more depressing than the solitude and the taunt and sneer and lash of her own thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was late in the afternoon before she nerved herself to go home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hoped the others would have gone off somewhere but they were waiting for her stanley anxious and cyrilla brindley irritated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as usual the indifferent spectator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> making up my mind said she in the tone that forewarns of a storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she struggled in vain against an impulse to look at keith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when her eyes turned in his direction he not looking at her moved in his listless she vacillated yielded began to put on the wraps stanley was collecting for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a big touring car and they sat two and two with the chauffeur alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were under way why did you stop me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps ill never have courage for what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have to clutch at and cling to somebody dont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant bear the idea of standing up by your you think im trying to fasten to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said with an angry laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are not satisfied with the way things are going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have doubts about your career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you shrink from your only comfortable alternative if the career winks out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ask me my opinion about yourself and about careers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i find you asked only that you might have someone to lean on to accuse of having got you into a mess if doing what you think you ought to do turns out it was the longest speech she had heard him make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had no inclination to dispute his analysis of her motives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not realize it said she but that is probably so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> butremember how i was brought go back to my husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go on as now replied he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you admit that you dislike me cried she triumphantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think me a weak clinging creature not able no answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> probably i have about the same opinion of you that what will become of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her face lighted up with an expression of reckless beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could only get started id go to the devil laughing you are started said he with an amiable smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i doubt if youll be so well amused as you may imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> going to the devil isnt as its painted in novels by homely old maids and by men too timid to go out of nights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few steps farther and your disillusionment will begin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but therell be no turning back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already you are almost too old to make im only twentyfour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i flattered myself i looked its worse than i thought said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the singers even the secondrate ones began at fifteen thats unjust she protested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent begun yet repeated he calmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have spent a lot of money and have done a lot of dreaming and talking and listening to compliments and have taken a lot of lessons of an expensive charlatan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what have those things to do with a oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said she in a tone of relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you on the contrary i know everything about a career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean that my voice is worthless because i what else could i have meant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you she laughed as she straightened herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do i look weak and sickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the purposes of a career as a female you are strong and well said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the purpose of a career as a singer he smiled and shook his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a singer must have muscles like wire ropes like a blacksmith or a washerwoman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other day we were climbing a hilla not very steep hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you stopped she was literally hanging her head with shame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wasnt very well that day she murmured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont indulge is your throat sore today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve its this sea air she eagerly protested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it no selfexcuse please interrupted he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cigarettes champagne all kinds of foolish food an impaired ive got splendid digestion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh you dont know the first thing about singing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know about temperament about we were talking of careers said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a career means a person who can be relied upon to do what is demanded of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a singers career means a powerful body perfect health a sound digestion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without them the voice will not be reliable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what you need is not singing teachers but teachers of athletics and of hygiene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to hear you talk about a career is like listening to a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think you can become a professional singer by paying money to a teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are lawyers and doctors and business men in all lines who think that way about their professionsthat learning a little routine of technical knowledge makes a lawyer or a doctor or learn to thinkand to persist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> learn to handle yourself as a great painter handles his brush and colors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then perhaps youll make a career as a singer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if not she was watching him with a wistful puzzled expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyone could by working away at it every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you gain only one inch a day in a year youll have gained three hundred and sixtyfive inches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you gain an inch a day for a while and hold it you soon begin to gain a foot a day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theres no need to worry about that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was gazing at her now with an expression of animation that showed how feverishly alive he was behind that mask of calmness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the days workthats the story of success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do the days work persistently thoroughly intelligently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thinking of it means dreaming or i begin to understand she said thoughtfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh ive been a a long silence then she said somewhat embarrassed and in a low voice though there was no danger of those i want you to know that there has been nothing do you wish me to put that to your credit or to your discredit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why youve just told me that you havent given stanley anything at all for his moneythat youve cheated him outright <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing itself is discreditable but your tone suggests that you think ill admire you do you mean to say that youd think more highly of me if i werewhat most women would be in the i mean to say that i think the whole business is discreditable to both of youto his intelligence to you are frank said she trying to hide her anger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am frank replied he undisturbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked you know that i need you that i dont dare why do you need me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent got any time to fool around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want their promise before i go to bed i aint the talking kind im the doing kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come to the right place for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when are you intending to leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for new york tomorrow eveningfor san francisco next morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are you going to do tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why ive got to go to the president with the petition and the delegation and get the appointment havent i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> executive session of the senate at p.m.got to get the appointment confirmedi reckon youll grant that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said riley meditatively you are right again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you take the train for new york in the evening and the steamer for san francisco next morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats itthats the way i map it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint a man to go fooling aroundim a man that does things i tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the storm was raging the thick snow blowing in gusts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> riley stood silent apparently deep in a reverie have you ever heard about that man who put up at gadsbys once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lykins against an iron fence buttonholed him fastened him with his eye like the ancient mariner and proceeded to unfold his narrative as placidly and peacefully as if we were all stretched comfortably in a blossomy summer meadow instead of being persecuted i will tell you about that man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gadsbys was the principal hotel then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well this man arrived from tennessee about nine oclock one morning with a black coachman and a splendid fourhorse carriage and an elegant dog which he was evidently fond of and proud of he drove up before gadsbys and the clerk and the landlord and everybody rushed out to take charge of him but he said never mind and jumped out and told the coachman to waitsaid he hadnt time to take anything to eat he only had a little claim against the government to collect would run across the way to the treasury and fetch the money and then get right along back to tennessee well about eleven oclock that night he came back and ordered a bed and told them to put the horses upsaid he would collect the claim in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was in january you understandjanuary the d of januarywednesday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well on the th of february he sold the fine carriage and bought a cheap secondhand onesaid it would answer just as well to take the money home in and he didnt care on the th of august he sold a pair of the fine horses said hed often thought a pair was better than four to go over the rough mountain roads with where a body had to be careful about his drivingand there wasnt so much of his claim but he could lug the money home on the th of december he sold another horsesaid two warnt necessary to drag that old light vehicle within fact one could snatch it along faster than was absolutely necessary now that it was good solid on the th of february he sold the old carriage and bought a cheap secondhand buggysaid a buggy was just the trick to skim along mushy slushy early spring roads with and he had always wanted to try on the st august he sold the buggy and bought the remains of an old sulkysaid he just wanted to see those green tennesseans stare and gawk when they saw him come aripping along in a sulkydidnt believe well on the th of august he sold his colored coachmansaid he didnt need a coachman for a sulky wouldnt be room enough for two in it anywayand besides it wasnt every day that providence sent a man a fool who was willing to pay nine hundred dollars for such a thirdrate negro as thatbeen wanting to get rid of the creature for years but didnt like to throw him away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eighteen months laterthat is to say on the th of february he sold the sulky and bought a saddlesaid horsebackriding was what the doctor had always recommended him to take and dogd if he wanted to risk his neck going over those mountain roads on the th of april he sold the saddlesaid he wasnt going to risk his life with any perishable saddlegirth that ever was made over a rainy miry april road while he could ride bareback and know and feel he was on the th of april he sold his horsesaid im just fiftyseven today hale and heartyit would be a pretty howdydo for me to be wasting such a trip as that and such weather as this on a horse when there aint anything in the world so splendid as a tramp on foot through the fresh spring woods and over the cheery mountains to a man that is a manand i can make my dog carry my claim in a little bundle anyway when its collected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so tomorrow ill be up bright and early make my little old collection and mosey off to tennessee on my own on the d of june he sold his dogsaid dern a dog anyway where youre just starting off on a rattling bully pleasure tramp through the summer woods and hillsperfect nuisancechases the squirrels barks at everything goes acapering and splattering around in the fords man cant get any chance to reflect and enjoy nature and id a blamed sight ruther carry the claim myself its a mighty sight safer a dogs mighty uncertain in a financial way always noticed itwell goodby boyslast callim off for tennessee with a good leg and a gay heart early in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a pause and a silenceexcept the noise of the wind and the pelting snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well very wellwhat of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im great friends with that old patriarch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he comes every evening to tell me goodby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw him an hour ago hes off for tennessee early tomorrow morningas usual said he calculated to get his claim through and be off before nightowls like me have turned out of bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tears were in his eyes he was so glad he was going to see his old tennessee and his friends once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well for the time of night and the kind of night it seems to me the story was full long enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well wheres the point of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh there isnt any particular point to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only if you are not in too much of a hurry to rush off to san francisco with that postoffice appointment mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lykins id advise you to put up at gadsbys for a spell and take it easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so saying riley blandly turned on his heel and left the astonished schoolteacher standing there a musing and motionless snow image shining in the broad glow of the streetlamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to go back to lucerne and its fishers i concluded after about nine hours waiting that the man who proposes to tarry till he sees something hook one of those wellfed and experienced fishes will find it wisdom to put up at gadsbys and take it easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is likely that a fish has not been caught on that lake pier for forty years but no matter the patient fisher watches his cork there all the day long just the same and seems to enjoy it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one may see the fisherloafers just as thick and contented and happy and patient all along the seine at paris but tradition says that the only thing ever caught there in modern times is a thing they dont fish for at allthe chapter xxvii close by the lion of lucerne is what they call the glacier gardenand it is the only one in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four or five years ago some workmen who were digging foundations for a house came upon this interesting relic of a longdeparted age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scientific men perceived in it a confirmation of their theories concerning the glacial period so through their persuasions the little tract of ground was bought and permanently protected against being built upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the soil was removed and there lay the rasped and guttered track which the ancient glacier had made as it moved along upon its slow and tedious journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this track was perforated by huge potshaped holes in the bedrock formed by the furious washingaround in them of boulders by the turbulent torrent which flows beneath all glaciers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these huge round boulders still remain in the holes they and the walls of the holes are worn smooth by the longcontinued chafing which they gave each other in those old days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took a mighty force to churn these big lumps of stone around in that vigorous way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the neighboring country had a very different shape at that timethe valleys have risen up and become hills since and the hills have become valleys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boulders discovered in the pots had traveled a great distance for there is no rock like them nearer than the distant for some days we were content to enjoy looking at the blue lake lucerne and at the piledup masses of snowmountains that border it all aroundan enticing spectacle this last for there is a strange and fascinating beauty and charm about a majestic snowpeak with the sun blazing upon it or the moonlight softly enriching itbut finally we concluded to try a bit of excursioning around on a steamboat and a dash on foot at the rigi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well we had a delightful trip to fluelen on a breezy sunny day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody sat on the upper deck on benches under an awning everybody talked laughed and exclaimed at the wonder scenery in truth a trip on that lake is almost the perfection of pleasuring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mountains were a neverceasing marvel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes they rose straight up out of the lake and towered aloft and overshadowed our pygmy steamer with their prodigious bulk in the most impressive way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not snowclad mountains these yet they climbed high enough toward the sky to meet the clouds and veil their foreheads in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not barren and repulsive but clothed in green and restful and pleasant to the eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they were so almost straightupanddown sometimes that one could not imagine a man being able to keep his footing upon such a surface yet there are paths sometimes one of these monster precipices had the slight inclination of the huge shiphouses in dockyards then high aloft toward the sky it took a little stronger inclination like that of a mansard roofand perched on this dizzy mansard ones eye detected little things like martin boxes and presently perceived that these were the dwellings of peasantsan airy place for a home truly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and suppose a peasant should walk in his sleep or his child should fall out of the front yard?the friends would have a tedious long journey down out of those cloudheights before they found the remains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet those faraway homes looked ever so seductive they were so remote from the troubled world they dozed in such an atmosphere of peace and dreamssurely no one who has learned to live up there would ever want we swept through the prettiest little curving arms of the lake among these colossal green walls enjoying new delights always as the stately panorama unfolded itself before us and rerolled and hid itself behind us and now and then we had the thrilling surprise of bursting suddenly upon a tremendous white mass like the distant and dominating jungfrau or some kindred giant once while i was hungrily taking in one of these surprises and doing my best to get all i possibly could of it while it youre an american i thinksom i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was about eighteen or possibly nineteen slender and of medium height open frank happy face a restless but independent eye a snub nose which had the air of drawing back with a decent reserve from the silky newborn mustache below it until it should be introduced a loosely hung jaw calculated to work easily in the sockets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore a lowcrowned narrowbrimmed straw hat with a broad blue ribbon around it which had a white anchor embroidered on it in front nobby shorttailed coat pantaloons vest all trim and neat and up with the fashion redstriped stockings very lowquarter patentleather shoes tied with black ribbon blue ribbon around his neck wideopen collar tiny diamond studs wrinkleless kids projecting cuffs fastened with large oxidized silver sleevebuttons bearing the device of a dogs faceenglish pug <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he carries a slim cane surmounted with an english pugs head with red glass eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under his arm he carried a german grammarottos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hair was short straight and smooth and presently when he turned his head a moment i saw that it was nicely parted behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took a cigarette out of a dainty box stuck it into a meerschaum holder which he carried in a morocco case yesi am an american <end> <end>

<start> <start> excuse me a minute theres some americans i havent seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went uninjured tooi had the murderous impulse to harpoon him in the back with my alpenstock but as i raised the weapon the disposition left me i found i hadnt the heart to kill him he was such half an hour later i was sitting on a bench inspecting with strong interest a noble monolith which we were skimming bya monolith not shaped by man but by natures free great handa massy pyramidal rock eighty feet high devised by nature ten million years ago against the day when a man worthy of it should need it for his monument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the time came at last and now this grand remembrancer bears schillers name in huge letters upon its face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> curiously enough this rock was not degraded or defiled in any way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is said that two years ago a stranger let himself down from the top of it with ropes and pulleys and painted all over it in blue letters bigger than those in try sozodont buy sun stove polish helmbolds buchu try benzaline for the blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was captured and it turned out that he was an american <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are from a land where any insolent that wants to is privileged to profane and insult nature and through her natures god if by so doing he can put a sordid penny in his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but here the case is different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because you are a foreigner and ignorant i will make your sentence light if you were a native i would deal strenuously with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hear and obey you will immediately remove every trace of your offensive work from the schiller monument you pay a fine of ten thousand francs you will suffer two years imprisonment at hard labor you will then be horsewhipped tarred and feathered deprived of your ears ridden on a rail to the confines of the canton and banished forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the severest penalties are omitted in your casenot as a grace to you but to that great republic which had the misfortune to give you birth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the steamers benches were ranged back to back across the deck <end> <end>

<start> <start> what hotel you going to stop at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we expect to stop in a pension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont hardly believe youll like that theres very few americans in the pensions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what hotel are you stopping at here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked you that before too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i always ask everybody what hotel theyre stopping at and so ive got my head all mixed up with hotels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it makes talk and i love to talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it refreshes me up sodont it youon a trip like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as long as im talking i never feel boredaint that the way with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there are exception to the rule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care to talk to everybody myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a person starts in to jabberjabberjabber about scenery and history and pictures and all sorts of tiresome things i get the fantods mighty soon <end> <end>

<start> <start> but the man who told me about mount pilatus says its one of the things to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it dont seem reasonable but he said so anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw it yesterday said it was dying then so i reckon its dead by this time <end> <end>

<start> <start> well i believe that is all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bonjouri am very glad to have made your acquaintance ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xxviii the rigikulm is an imposing alpine mass six thousand feet high which stands by itself and commands a mighty prospect of blue lakes green valleys and snowy mountains a compact and magnificent picture three hundred miles in circumference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ascent is made by rail or horseback or on foot as one may prefer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i and my agent panoplied ourselves in walkingcostume one bright morning and started down the lake on the steamboat we got ashore at the village of waggis threequarters of an hour distant we were soon tramping leisurely up the leafy mulepath and then the talk began to flow as usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was twelve oclock noon and a breezy cloudless day the ascent was gradual and the glimpses from under the curtaining boughs of blue water and tiny sailboats and beetling cliffs were as charming as glimpses of dreamland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the circumstances were perfectand the anticipations too for we should soon be enjoying for the first time that wonderful spectacle an alpine sunrisethe object of our journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was apparently no real need for hurry for the guidebook made the walkingdistance from waggis to the summit only three hours and a quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say apparently because the guidebook had already fooled us onceabout the distance from allerheiligen to oppenauand for aught i knew it might be getting ready to fool us again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were only certain as to the altitudes we calculated to find out for ourselves how many hours it is from the bottom to the top <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the summit is six thousand feet above the sea but only fortyfive hundred feet above the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we had walked half an hour we were fairly into the swing and humor of the undertaking so we cleared for action that is to say we got a boy whom we met to carry our alpenstocks and satchels and overcoats and things for us that left us free for business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose we must have stopped oftener to stretch out on the grass in the shade and take a bit of a smoke than this boy was used to for presently he asked if it had been our idea to hire him by the job or by the year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we told him he could move along if he was in a hurry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said he wasnt in such a very particular hurry but he wanted to get to the top while he was young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we told him to clear out then and leave the things at the uppermost hotel and say we should be along presently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said he would secure us a hotel if he could but if they were all full he would ask them to build another one and hurry up and get the paint and plaster dry against we arrived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still gently chaffing us he pushed ahead up the trail and soon disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by six oclock we were pretty high up in the air and the view of lake and mountains had greatly grown in breadth and interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we halted awhile at a little public house where we had bread and cheese and a quart or two of fresh milk out on the porch with the big panorama all before usand ten minutes afterward we met a hot redfaced man plunging down the mountain making mighty strides swinging his alpenstock ahead of him and taking a grip on the ground with its iron point to support these big strides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped fanned himself with his hat swabbed the perspiration from his face and neck with a red handkerchief panted a moment or two and asked how far to waggis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why it seems as if i could toss a biscuit into the lake from here its so close by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said he i cant stand another three hours ive had enough today ill take a bed there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are we nearly to the top <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why bless your soul you havent really started yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said we would put up at the inn too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we turned back and ordered a hot supper and had quite a jolly the german landlady gave us neat rooms and nice beds and when i and my agent turned in it was with the resolution to be up early and make the utmost of our first alpine sunrise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of course we were dead tired and slept like policemen so when we awoke in the morning and ran to the window it was already too late because it was half past eleven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however we ordered breakfast and told the landlady to call the englishman but she said he was already up and off at daybreakand swearing like mad about something or other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could not find out what the matter was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had asked the landlady the altitude of her place above the level of the lake and she told him fourteen hundred and ninetyfive feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was all that was said then he lost his temper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that between fools and guidebooks a man could acquire ignorance enough in twentyfour hours in a country like this to last him a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harris believed our boy had been loading him up with misinformation and this was probably the case for his epithet described we got under way about the turn of noon and pulled out for the summit again with a fresh and vigorous step <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we had gone about two hundred yards and stopped to rest i glanced to the left while i was lighting my pipe and in the distance detected a long worm of black smoke crawling lazily up the steep mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course that was the locomotive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we propped ourselves on our elbows at once to gaze for we had never seen a mountain railway yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently we could make out the train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed incredible that that thing should creep straight up a sharp slant like the roof of a housebut there it was and it was doing in the course of a couple hours we reached a fine breezy altitude where the little shepherd huts had big stones all over their roofs to hold them down to the earth when the great storms rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the country was wild and rocky about here but there were plenty of trees plenty of moss away off on the opposite shore of the lake we could see some villages and now for the first time we could observe the real difference between their proportions and those of the giant mountains at whose feet they slept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when one is in one of those villages it seems spacious and its houses seem high and not out of proportion to the mountain that overhands thembut from our altitude what a change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mountains were bigger and grander than ever as they stood there thinking their solemn thoughts with their heads in the drifting clouds but the villages at their feetwhen the painstaking eye could trace them up and find themwere so reduced almost invisible and lay so flat against the ground that the exactest simile i can devise is to compare them to antdeposits of granulated dirt overshadowed by the huge bulk of a cathedral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the steamboats skimming along under the stupendous precipices were diminished by distance to the daintiest little toys the sailboats and rowboats to shallops proper for fairies that keep house in the cups of lilies and ride to court on the backs presently we came upon half a dozen sheep nibbling grass in the spray of a stream of clear water that sprang from a rock wall a hundred feet high and all at once our ears were startled with a melodious lul  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pealing joyously from a near but invisible source and recognized that we were hearing for the first time the famous alpine jodel in its own native wilds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we recognized also that it was that sort of quaint commingling of baritone and falsetto which at home we call tyrolese warbling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jodeling pronounced yodlingemphasis on the o continued and was very pleasant and inspiriting to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the jodeler appeareda shepherd boy of sixteen and in our gladness and gratitude we gave him a franc to jodel some more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he jodeled and we listened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we moved on presently and he generously jodeled us out of sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after about fifteen minutes we came across another shepherd boy who was jodeling and gave him half a franc to keep it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he also jodeled us out of sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that we found a jodeler every ten minutes we gave the first one eight cents the second one six cents the third one four the fourth one a penny contributed nothing to nos <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and and during the remainder of the day hired the rest of the jodelers at a franc apiece not to jodel any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is somewhat about the middle of the afternoon we passed through a prodigious natural gateway called the felsenthor formed by two enormous upright rocks with a third lying across the top <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a very attractive little hotel close by but our energies were not conquered yet three hours afterward we came to the railwaytrack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was planted straight up the mountain with the slant of a ladder that leans against a house and it seemed to us that man would need good nerves who proposed during the latter part of the afternoon we cooled our roasting interiors with icecold water from clear streams the only really satisfying water we had tasted since we left home for at the hotels on the continent they merely give you a tumbler of ice to soak your water in and that only modifies its hotness doesnt make it cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> water can only be made cold enough for summer comfort by being prepared in a refrigerator or a closed icepitcher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do they at ten minutes past six we reached the kaltbad station where there is a spacious hotel with great verandas which command a majestic expanse of lake and mountain scenery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were pretty well fagged out now but as we did not wish to miss the alpine sunrise we got through our dinner as quickly as possible and hurried off to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was unspeakably comfortable to stretch our weary limbs between the cool damp sheets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how we did sleep!for in the morning we both awoke and leaped out of bed at the same instant and ran and stripped aside the windowcurtains but we suffered a bitter disappointment again it we dressed sullenly and in ill spirits each accusing the other of oversleeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harris said if we had brought the courier along as we ought to have done we should not have missed these sunrises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said he knew very well that one of us would have to sit up and wake the courier and i added that we were having trouble enough to take care of ourselves on this climb without having to take during breakfast our spirits came up a little since we found by this guidebook that in the hotels on the summit the tourist is not left to trust to luck for his sunrise but is roused betimes by a man who goes through the halls with a great alpine horn blowing blasts that would raise the dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there was another consoling thing the guidebook said that up there on the summit the guests did not wait to dress much but seized a red bed blanket and sailed out arrayed like an indian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was good this would be romantic two hundred and fifty people grouped on the windy summit with their hair flying and their red blankets flapping in the solemn presence of the coming sun would be a striking and memorable spectacle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it was good luck not ill luck that we had missed we were informed by the guidebook that we were now feet above the level of the laketherefore full twothirds of our journey had been accomplished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got away at a quarter past four pm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hundred yards above the hotel the railway divided one track went straight up the steep hill the other one turned square off to the right with a very slight grade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we took the latter and followed it more than a mile turned a rocky corner and came in sight of a handsome new hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we had gone on we should have arrived at the summit but harris preferred to ask a lot of questionsas usual of a man who didnt know anythingand he told us to go back and follow the other route <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could ill we climbed and climbed and we kept on climbing we reached about forty summits but there was always another one just ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it came on to rain and it rained in dead earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were soaked through and it was bitter cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next a smoky fog of clouds covered the whole region densely and we took to the railwayties to keep from getting lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes we slopped along in a narrow path on the lefthand side of the track but by and by when the fog blew as aside a little and we saw that we were treading the rampart of a precipice and that our left elbows were projecting over a perfectly boundless and bottomless vacancy the night shut down dark and drizzly and cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about eight in the evening the fog lifted and showed us a wellworn path which led up a very steep rise to the left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we took it and as soon as we had got far enough from the railway to render the finding it again an impossibility we were in a bleak unsheltered place now and had to trudge right along in order to keep warm though we rather expected to go over a precipice sooner or later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about nine oclock we made an important discovery that we were not in any path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we groped around a while on our hands and knees but we could not find it we were terrified into this by being suddenly confronted with a vast body which showed itself vaguely for an instant and in the next instant was smothered in the fog again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was really the hotel we were after monstrously magnified by the fog but we took it for the face of a precipice we sat there an hour with chattering teeth and quivering bodies and quarreled over all sorts of trifles but gave most of our attention to abusing each other for the stupidity of deserting the railwaytrack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we sat with our backs to the precipice because what little wind there was came from that quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at some time or other the fog thinned a little we did not know when for we were facing the empty universe and the thinness could not show but at last harris happened to look around and there stood a huge dim spectral hotel where the precipice had been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could faintly discern the windows and chimneys and a dull blur of lights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our first emotion was deep unutterable gratitude our next was a foolish rage born of the suspicion that possibly the hotel had been visible threequarters of an hour while we sat there yes it was the rigikulm hotelthe one that occupies the extreme summit and whose remote little sparkle of lights we had often seen glinting high aloft among the stars from our balcony away down yonder in lucerne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crusty portier and the crusty clerks gave us the surly reception which their kind deal out in prosperous times but by mollifying them with an extra display of obsequiousness and servility we finally got them to show us to the room we got into some dry clothing and while our supper was preparing we loafed forsakenly through a couple of vast cavernous drawingrooms one of which had a stove in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this stove was in a corner and densely walled around with people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could not get near the fire so we moved at large in the artic spaces among a multitude of people who sat silent smileless forlorn and shiveringthinking what fools they were to come perhaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were some americans and some germans but one could see that the we lounged into an apartment where there was a great crowd to see what was going on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tourists were eagerly buying all sorts and styles of papercutters marked souvenir of the rigi with handles made of the little curved horn of the ostensible chamois there were all manner of wooden goblets and such things similarly marked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was going to buy a papercutter but i believed i could remember the cold comfort of the rigikulm supper warmed us and we went immediately to bedbut first as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baedeker requests all tourists to call his attention to any errors which they may find in his guidebooks i dropped him a line to inform him he missed it by just about three days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had previously informed him of his mistake about the distance from allerheiligen to oppenau and had also informed the ordnance depart of the german government of the same error in the imperial maps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will add here that i never got any answer to those letters or any thanks from either of those sources and what is still more discourteous these corrections have not been made either in the maps or the guidebooks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i will write we curled up in the clammy beds and went to sleep without rocking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were so sodden with fatigue that we never stirred nor turned over till the blooming blasts of the alpine horn aroused us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may well be imagined that we did not lose any time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we snatched on a few odds and ends of clothing cocooned ourselves in the proper red blankets and plunged along the halls and out into the whistling wind bareheaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we saw a tall wooden scaffolding on the very peak of the summit a hundred yards away and made for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we rushed up the stairs to the top of this scaffolding and stood there above the vast outlying world with hair flying and ruddy blankets waving and cracking in the fierce fifteen minutes too late at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said harris in a vexed voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun is clear above the horizon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no matter i said it is a most magnificent spectacle and we will see it do the rest of its rising anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment we were deeply absorbed in the marvel before us and dead to everything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great cloudbarred disk of the sun stood just above a limitless expanse of tossing whitecapsso to speaka billowy chaos of massy mountain domes and peaks draped in imperishable snow and flooded with an opaline glory of changing and dissolving splendors while through rifts in a black cloudbank above the sun radiating lances of diamond dust shot to the zenith <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cloven valleys of the lower world swam in a tinted mist which veiled the ruggedness of their crags and ribs and ragged forests and turned all the forbidding region we could not speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could only gaze in drunken ecstasy and drink in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had missed the morning hornblow look here the sun isnt the spectacleits usstacked up here on top of this gallows in these idiotic blankets and two hundred and fifty welldressed men and women down here gawking up at us and not caring a straw whether the sun rises or sets as long as theyve got such a ridiculous spectacle as this to set down in their memorandumbooks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seem to be laughing their ribs loose and theres one girl there at appears to be going all to pieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw such a man as you before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you are the very last possibility in the way of an ass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got up at half past seven oclock in the evening to see the sun rise thats what youve done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and have you done any better id like to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive always used to get up with the lark till i came under the petrifying influence of your turgid intellect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you used to get up with the larkoh no doubt youll get up with the hangman one of these days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you ought to be ashamed to be jawing here like this in a red blanket on a fortyfoot scaffold on top of the alps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and no end of people down here to boot this isnt any place for an exhibition of temper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so the customary quarrel went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the sun was fairly down we slipped back to the hotel in the charitable gloaming and went to bed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had encountered the hornblower on the way and he had tried to collect compensation not only for announcing the sunset which we did see but for the sunrise which we had totally missed but we said no we only took our solar rations on the european planpay for what you get <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he promised to make us hear his horn in the morning chapter xxix he kept his word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we heard his horn and instantly got up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was dark and cold and wretched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i fumbled around for the matches knocking things down with my quaking hands i wished the sun would rise in the middle of the day when it was warm and bright and cheerful and one wasnt sleepy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we proceeded to dress by the gloom of a couple sickly candles but we could hardly button anything our hands shook so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought of how many happy people there were in europe asia and america and everywhere who were sleeping peacefully in their beds and did not have to get up and see the rigi sunrisepeople who did not appreciate their advantage as like as not but would get up in the morning wanting more boons of providence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while thinking these thoughts i yawned in a rather ample way and my upper teeth got hitched on a nail over the door and while i was mounting a chair to free myself harris drew oh this is luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shant have to go out at all yonder are the mountains in full view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made us cheerful right away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could see the grand alpine masses dimly outlined against the black firmament and one or two faint stars blinking through rifts in the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fully clothed and wrapped in blankets and huddled ourselves up by the window with lighted pipes and fell into chat while we waited in exceeding comfort to see how an alpine sunrise was going to look by candlelight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by a delicate spiritual sort of effulgence spread itself by imperceptible degrees over the loftiest altitudes of the snowy wastesbut there the effort seemed to stop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a hitch about this sunrise somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you reckon is the matter with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appears to hang fire somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw a sunrise act like that before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can it be that the hotel is playing anything on us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hotel merely has a property interest in the sun it has nothing to do with the management of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a precarious kind of property too a succession of total eclipses would probably ruin this tavern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now what can be the matter with this sunrise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know whats the matter with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weve been looking at the place where the sun set last night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why couldnt you have thought of that sooner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was exactly like you to light a pipe and sit down to wait for the sun to rise in the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was exactly like me to find out the mistake too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you never would have found it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i find out all the mistakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you make them all too else your most valuable faculty would be wasted on you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dont stop to quarrel nowmaybe we are not too late yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was well up when we got to the exhibitionground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on our way up we met the crowd returningmen and women dressed in all sorts of queer costumes and exhibiting all degrees of cold and wretchedness in their gaits and countenances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dozen still remained on the ground when we reached there huddled together about the scaffold with their backs to the bitter wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had their red guidebooks open at the diagram of the view and were painfully picking out the several mountains and trying to impress their names and positions on their memories <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two sides of this place were guarded by railings to keep people from being blown over the precipices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the view looking sheer down into the broad valley eastward from this great elevationalmost a perpendicular milewas very quaint and curious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> counties towns hilly ribs and ridges wide stretches of green meadow great forest tracts winding streams a dozen blue lakes a block of busy steamboatswe saw all this little world in unique circumstantiality of detailsaw it just as the birds see itand all reduced to the smallest of scales and as sharply worked out and finished as a steel engraving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the numerous toy villages with tiny spires projecting out of them were just as the children might have left them when done with play the day before the forest tracts were diminished to cushions of moss one or two big lakes were dwarfed to ponds the smaller ones to puddlesthough they did not look like puddles but like blue eardrops which had fallen and lodged in slight depressions conformable to their shapes among the mossbeds and the smooth levels of dainty green farmland the microscopic steamboats glided along as in a city reservoir taking a mighty time to cover the distance between ports which seemed only a yard apart and the isthmus which separated two lakes looked as if one might stretch out on it and lie with both elbows in the water yet we knew invisible wagons were toiling across it and finding the distance a tedious one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this beautiful miniature world had exactly the appearance of those relief maps which reproduce nature precisely with the heights and depressions and other details graduated to a reduced scale and with the rocks trees lakes i believed we could walk down to waggis or vitznau in a day but i knew we could go down by rail in about an hour so i chose the latter method <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to see what it was like anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train came along about the middle of the afternoon and an odd thing it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the locomotiveboiler stood on end and it and the whole locomotiveboiler stood on end and it and the whole locomotive were tiled sharply backward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were two passengercars roofed but wide open all around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these cars were not tilted back but the seats were this enables the passenger to sit level while going down a there are three railwaytracks the central one is cogged the lantern wheel of the engine grips its way along these cogs and pulls the train up the hill or retards its motion on the down trip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about the same speedthree miles an houris maintained both ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether going up or down the locomotive is always at the lower end of the train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it pushes in the one case braces back in the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the passenger rides backward going up and faces forward we got front seats and while the train moved along about fifty yards on level ground i was not the least frightened but now it started abruptly downstairs and i caught my breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i like my neighbors unconsciously held back all i could and threw my weight to the rear but of course that did no particular good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had slidden down the balusters when i was a boy and thought nothing of it but to slide down the balusters in a railwaytrain is a thing to make ones flesh creep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes we had as much as ten yards of almost level ground and this gave us a few full breaths in comfort but straightway we would turn a corner and see a long steep line of rails stretching down below us and the comfort was at an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one expected to see the locomotive pause or slack up a little and approach this plunge cautiously but it did nothing of the kind it went calmly on and went it reached the jumpingoff place it made a sudden bow and went gliding smoothly downstairs untroubled by it was wildly exhilarating to slide along the edge of the precipices after this grisly fashion and look straight down upon that faroff valley which i was describing a while ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no level ground at the kaltbad station the railbed was as steep as a roof i was curious to see how the stop was going to be managed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was very simple the train came sliding down and when it reached the right spot it just stoppedthat was all there was to itstopped on the steep incline and when the exchange of passengers and baggage had been made it moved off and went sliding down again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was one curious effect which i need not take the trouble to describebecause i can scissor a description of it out of the railway companys advertising pamphlet on the whole tour particularly at the descent we undergo an optical illusion which often seems to be incredible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the shrubs fir trees stables houses etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seem to be bent in a slanting direction as by an immense pressure of air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are all standing awry so much awry that the chalets and cottages of the peasants seem to be tumbling down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the consequence of the steep inclination of the line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who are seated in the carriage do not observe that they are doing down a declivity of twenty to twentyfive degrees their seats being adapted to this course of proceeding and being bent down at their backs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they mistake their carriage and its horizontal lines for a proper measure of the normal plain and therefore all the objects outside which really are in a horizontal position must show a disproportion of twenty to twentyfive degrees declivity in regard to the mountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the time one reaches kaltbad he has acquired confidence in the railway and he now ceases to try to ease the locomotive by holding back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thenceforth he smokes his pipe in serenity and gazes out upon the magnificent picture below and about him with unfettered enjoyment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing to interrupt the view or the breeze it is like inspecting the world on the wing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howeverto be exactthere is one place where the serenity lapses for a while this is while one is crossing the schnurrtobel bridge a frail structure which swings its gossamer frame down through the dizzy air over a gorge like a vagrant spiderstrand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one has no difficulty in remembering his sins while the train is creeping down this bridge and he repents of them too though he sees when he gets to vitznau so ends the eventual trip which we made to the rigikulm chapter xxx an hours sail brought us to lucerne again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i judged it best to go to bed and rest several days for i knew that the man who undertakes to make the tour of europe thinking over my plans as mapped out i perceived that they did not take in the furka pass the rhone glacier the finsteraarhorn the wetterhorn etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i immediately examined the guidebook to see if these were important and found they were in fact a pedestrian tour of europe could not be complete without them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course that decided me at once to see them for i never allow myself to do i called in my agent and instructed him to go without delay and make a careful examination of these noted places on foot and bring me back a written report of the result for insertion in my book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i instructed him to go to hospenthal as quickly as possible and make his grand start from there to extend his foot expedition as far as the giesbach fall and return to me from thence by diligence or mule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he objected to the courier and with some show of reason since he was about to venture upon new and untried ground but i thought he might as well learn how to take care of the courier now as later therefore i enforced my point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said that the trouble delay and inconvenience of traveling with a courier were balanced by the deep respect which a couriers presence commands and i must insist that as much style be thrown into my journeys so the two assumed complete mountaineering costumes and departed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a week later they returned pretty well about seven oclock in the morning with perfectly fine weather we started from hospenthal and arrived at the maison on the furka in a little under quatre hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the want of variety in the scenery from hospenthal made the kahkahponeeka wearisome but let none be discouraged no one can fail to be completely recompensee for his fatigue when he sees for the first time the monarch of the oberland the tremendous finsteraarhorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment before all was dullness but a pas further has placed us on the summit of the furka and exactly in front of us at a hopow of only fifteen miles this magnificent mountain lifts its snowwreathed precipices into the deep blue sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inferior mountains on each side of the pass form a sort of frame for the picture of their dread lord and close in the view so completely that no other prominent feature in the oberland is visible from this bongabong nothing withdraws the attention from the solitary grandeur of the finsteraarhorn and the dependent spurs which form with the addition of some others who were also bound for the grimsel we formed a large xhvloj as we descended the steg which winds round the shoulder of a mountain toward the rhone glacier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we soon left the path and took to the ice and after wandering amongst the crevices un peu to admire the wonders of these deep blue caverns and hear the rushing of waters through their subglacial channels we struck out a course toward lautre cote and crossed the glacier successfully a little above the cave from which the infant rhone takes its first bound from under the grand precipice of ice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half a mile below this we began to climb the flowery side of the meienwand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of our party started before the rest but the hitze was so great that we found ihm quite exhausted and lying at full length in the shade of a large gestein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we sat down with him for a time for all felt the heat exceedingly in the climb up this very steep bolwoggoly and then we set out again together and arrived at last near the dead mans lake at the foot of the sidelhorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this lonely spot once used for an extempore buryingplace after a sanguinary battue between the french and austrians is the perfection of desolation there is nothing in sight to mark the hand of man except the line of weatherbeaten whitened posts set up to indicate the direction of the pass in the owdawakk of winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near this point the footpath joins the wider track which connects the grimsel with the head of the rhone schnawp this has been carefully constructed and leads with a tortuous course among and over les pierres down to the bank of the gloomy little swoshswosh which almost washes against the walls of the grimsel hospice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we arrived a little before four oclock at the end of our days journey hot enough to justify the step taking by most of the partie of plunging into the crystal the next afternoon we started for a walk up the unteraar glacier with the intention of at all events getting as far as the hutte which is used as a sleepingplace by most of those who cross the strahleck pass to grindelwald <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got over the tedious collection of stones and debris which covers the pied of the gletcher and had walked nearly three hours from the grimsel when just as we were thinking of crossing over to the right to climb the cliffs at the foot of the hut the clouds which had for some time assumed a threatening appearance suddenly dropped and a huge mass of them driving toward us from the finsteraarhorn poured down a deluge of haboolong and hail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately we were not far from a very large glaciertable it was a huge rock balanced on a pedestal of ice high enough to admit of our all creeping under it for gowkarak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stream of puckittypukk had furrowed a course for itself in the ice at its base and we were obliged to stand with one fuss on each side of this and endeavor to keep ourselves chaud by cutting steps in the steep bank of the pedestal so as to get a higher place for standing on as the wasser rose rapidly in its trench <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a very cold bzzzzzzzzeee accompanied the storm and made our position far from pleasant and presently came a flash of blitzen apparently in the middle of our little party with an instantaneous clap of yokky sounding like a large gun fired close to our ears the effect was startling but in a few seconds our attention was fixed by the roaring echoes of the thunder against the tremendous mountains which completely surrounded us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was followed by many more bursts none of welche however was so dangerously near and after waiting a long demihour in our icy prison we sallied out to talk through a haboolong which though not so heavy as before was quite enough to give us a thorough soaking before our arrival at the the grimsel is certainement a wonderful place situated at the bottom of a sort of huge crater the sides of which are utterly savage gebirge composed of barren rocks which cannot even support a single pine arbre and afford only scanty food for a herd of gmwkwllolp it looks as if it must be completely begraben in the winter snows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> enormous avalanches fall against it every spring sometimes covering everything to the depth of thirty or forty feet and in spite of walls four feet thick and furnished with outside shutters the two men who stay here when the voyageurs are snugly quartered in their distant homes can tell you that the snow sometimes shakes the house to its next morning the hogglebumgullup still continued bad but we made up our minds to go on and make the best of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half an hour after we started the regen thickened unpleasantly and we attempted to get shelter under a projecting rock but being far to nass already to make standing at all agreable we pushed on for the handeck consoling ourselves with the reflection that from the furious rushing of the river aar at our side we should at all events see the celebrated wasserfall in grande perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor were we nappersocket in our expectation the water was roaring down its leap of two hundred and fifty feet in a most magnificent frenzy while the trees which cling to its rocky sides swayed to and fro in the violence of the hurricane which it brought down with it even the stream which falls into the main cascade at right angles and toutefois forms a beautiful feature in the scene was now swollen into a raging torrent and the violence of this meeting of the waters about fifty feet below the frail bridge where we stood was fearfully grand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while we were looking at it glucklicheweise a gleam of sunshine came out and instantly a beautiful rainbow was formed by the spray and hung in midair suspended over on going into the chalet above the fall we were informed that a brucke had broken down near guttanen and that it would be impossible to proceed for some time accordingly we were kept in our drenched condition for ein stunde when some voyageurs arrived from meiringen and told us that there had been a trifling accident aber that we could now cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on arriving at the spot i was much inclined to suspect that the whole story was a ruse to make us slowwk and drink the more at the handeck inn for only a few planks had been carried away and though there might perhaps have been some difficulty with mules the gap was certainly not larger than a mmbglx might cross with a very slight leap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near guttanen the haboolong happily ceased and we had time to walk ourselves tolerably dry before arriving at reichenback wo we enjoyed a good dine next morning we walked to rosenlaui the beau ideal of swiss scenery where we spent the middle of the day in an excursion to the glacier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was more beautiful than words can describe for in the constant progress of the ice it has changed the form of its extremity and formed a vast cavern as blue as the sky above and rippled like a frozen ocean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few steps cut in the whoopjamboreehoo enabled us to walk completely under this and feast our eyes upon one of the loveliest objects in creation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the glacier was all around divided by numberless fissures of the same exquisite color and the finest wooderdbeeren were growing in abundance but a few yards from the ice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inn stands in a charmant spot close to the cote de la riviere which lower down forms the reichenbach fall and embosomed in the richest of pine woods while the fine form of the wellhorn looking down upon it completes the enchanting bopple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the afternoon we walked over the great scheideck to grindelwald stopping to pay a visit to the upper glacier by the way but we were again overtaken by bad hogglebumgullup and arrived at the hotel in a solche the clouds by this time seemed to have done their worst for a lovely day succeeded which we determined to devote to an ascent of the faulhorn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we left grindelwald just as a thunderstorm was dying away and we hoped to find guten wetter up above but the rain which had nearly ceased began again and we were struck by the rapidly increasing froid as we ascended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twothirds of the way up were completed when the rain was exchanged for gnillic with which the boden was thickly covered and before we arrived at the top the gnillic and mist became so thick that we could not see one another at more than twenty poopoo distance and it became difficult to pick our way over the rough and thickly covered ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shivering with cold we turned into bed with a double allowance of clothes and slept comfortably while the wind howled autour de la maison when i awoke the wall and the window looked equally dark but in another hour i found i could just see the form of the latter so i jumped out of bed and forced it open though with great difficulty from a row of huge icicles hung down from the edge of the roof and anything more wintry than the whole anblick could not well be imagined but the sudden appearance of the great mountains in front was so startling that i felt no inclination to move toward bed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the snow which had collected upon la fenetre had increased the finsterniss oder der dunkelheit so that when i looked out i was surprised to find that the daylight was considerable and that the balragoomah would evidently rise before long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the brightest of les etoiles were still shining the sky was cloudless overhead though small curling mists lay thousands of feet below us in the valleys wreathed around the feet of the mountains and adding to the splendor of their lofty summits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were soon dressed and out of the house watching the gradual approach of dawn thoroughly absorbed in the first near view of the oberland giants which broke upon us unexpectedly after the intense obscurity of the evening before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried some one as that grand summit gleamed with the first rose of dawn and in a few moments the double crest of the schreckhorn followed its example peak after peak seemed warmed with life the jungfrau blushed even more beautifully than her neighbors and soon from the wetterhorn in the east to the wildstrubel in the west a long row of fires glowed upon mighty altars truly worthy of the gods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wlgw was very severe our sleepingplace could hardly be distinguee from the snow around it which had fallen to a depth of a flirk during the past evening and we heartily enjoyed a rough scramble en bas to the giesbach falls where we soon found a warm climate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at noon the day before grindelwald the thermometer could not have stood at less than degrees fahr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the sun and in the evening judging from the icicles formed and the state of the windows there must have been at least twelve dingblatter of frost thus giving a change of you have done well harris this report is concise compact well expressed the language is crisp the descriptions are vivid and not needlessly elaborated your report goes straight to the point attends strictly to business and doesnt fool around <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is in many ways an excellent document <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it has a faultit is too learned it is much too learned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dingblatter is a fiji word meaning degrees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you knew the english of it then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the eskimo term for snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so you knew the english for that too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the form of the wellhorn looking down upon it completes the enchanting bopple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we were again overtaken by bad hogglebumgullup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is hogglebumgullup better than the english word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no it means just the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and dingblatter and gnillic and bopple and schnawpare they better than the english words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no they mean just what the english ones do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then why do you use them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why have you used all this chinese and choctaw and zulu rubbish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i didnt know any french but two or three words and i didnt know any latin or greek at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should you want to use foreign words anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anybody has a right to that wants to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then proceeded in the following scathing manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when really learned men write books for other learned men to read they are justified in using as many learned words as they pleasetheir audience will understand them but a man who writes a book for the general public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pages with untranslated foreign expressions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is an insolence toward the majority of the purchasers for it is a very frank and impudent way of saying get the translations made yourself if you want them this book is not written for the ignorant classes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are men who know a foreign language so well and have used it so long in their daily life that they seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their english writings unconsciously and so they omit to translate as much as half the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the mans readers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the excuse for this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the writer would say he only uses the foreign language where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyed in english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well then he writes his best things for the tenth man and he ought to warn the nine other not to buy his book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however the excuse he offers is at least an excuse but there is another set of men who are like you they know a word here and there of a foreign language or a few beggarly little threeword phrases filched from the back of the dictionary and these are continually peppering into their literature with a pretense of knowing that languagewhat excuse can they offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foreign words and phrases which they use have their exact equivalents in a nobler languageenglish yet they think they adorn their page when they say strasse for street and bahnhof for railwaystation and so onflaunting these fluttering rags of poverty in the readers face and imagining he will be ass enough to take them for the sign of untold riches held in reserve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will let your learning remain in your report you have as much right i suppose to adorn your page with zulu and chinese and choctaw rubbish as others of your sort have to adorn theirs with insolent odds and ends smouched from half a dozen learned tongues whose ab abs they dont even know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the musing spider steps upon the redhot shovel he first exhibits a wild surprise then he shrivels up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> similar was the effect of these blistering words upon the tranquil and unsuspecting agent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can be dreadfully rough chapter xxxi we now prepared for a considerable walkfrom lucerne to interlaken over the brunig pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the last moment the weather was so good that i changed my mind and hired a fourhorse carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a huge vehicle roomy as easy we got away pretty early in the morning after a hot breakfast and went bowling over a hard smooth road through the summer loveliness of switzerland with near and distant lakes and mountains before and about us for the entertainment of the eye and the music of multitudinous birds to charm the ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes there was only the width of the road between the imposing precipices on the right and the clear cool water on the left with its shoals of uncatchable fish skimming about through the bars of sun and shadow and sometimes in place of the precipices the grassy land stretched away in an apparently endless upward slant and was dotted everywhere with snug little chalets the ordinary chalet turns a broad honest gable end to the road and its ample roof hovers over the home in a protecting caressing way projecting its sheltering eaves far outward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the quaint windows are filled with little panes and garnished with white muslin curtains and brightened with boxes of blooming flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across the front of the house and up the spreading eaves and along the fanciful railings of the shallow porch are elaborate carvingswreaths fruits arabesques verses from scripture names dates etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the building is wholly of wood reddish brown in tint a very pleasing color <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it generally has vines climbing over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> set such a house against the fresh green of the hillside and it looks ever so cozy and inviting and picturesque one does not find out what a hold the chalet has taken upon him until he presently comes upon a new house a house which is aping the town fashions of germany and france a prim hideous straightupanddown thing plastered all over on the outside to look like stone and altogether so stiff and formal and ugly and forbidding and so out of tune with the gracious landscape and so deaf and dumb and dead to the poetry of its surroundings that it suggests an undertaker at a picnic a corpse at in the course of the morning we passed the spot where pontius pilate is said to have thrown himself into the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the legend goes that after the crucifixion his conscience troubled him and he fled from jerusalem and wandered about the earth weary of life and a prey to tortures of the mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eventually he hid himself away on the heights of mount pilatus and dwelt alone among the clouds and crags for years but rest and peace were still denied him presently we passed the place where a man of better odor was born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the childrens friend santa claus or st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some unaccountable reputations in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has ranked for ages as the peculiar friend of children yet it appears he was not much of a friend to his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had ten of them and when fifty years old he left them and sought out as dismal a refuge from the world as possible and became a hermit in order that he might reflect upon pious themes without being disturbed by the joyous and other judging by pilate and st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholas there exists no rule for the construction of hermits they seem made out of all kinds of material <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but pilate attended to the matter of expiating his sin while he was alive whereas st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholas will probably have to go on climbing down sooty chimneys christmas eve forever and conferring kindness on other peoples children to make up for deserting his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his bones are kept in a church in a village sachseln which we visited and are naturally held in great reverence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his portrait is common in the farmhouses of the region but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during his hermit life according to legend he partook of the bread and wine of the communion once a month a constant marvel with us as we sped along the bases of the steep mountains on this journey was not that avalanches occur but that they are not occurring all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one does not understand why rocks and landslides do not plunge down these declivities daily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a landslip occurred three quarters of a century ago on the route from arth to brunnen which was a formidable thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mass of conglomerate two miles long a thousand feet broad and a hundred feet thick broke away from a cliff three thousand feet high and hurled itself into the valley below we had such a beautiful day and such endless pictures of limpid lakes and green hills and valleys and majestic mountains and milky cataracts dancing down the steeps and gleaming in the sun that we could not help feeling sweet toward all the world so we tried to drink all the milk and eat all the grapes and apricots and berries and buy all the bouquets of wild flowers which the little peasant boys and girls offered for sale at short distancesand they were entirely too shortall along the road were groups of neat and comely children with their wares nicely and temptingly set forth in the grass under the shade trees and as soon as we approached they swarmed into the road holding out their baskets and milk bottles and ran beside the carriage barefoot and bareheaded and importuned us to buy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seldom desisted early but continued to run and insistbeside the wagon while they could and behind it until they lost breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they turned and chased a returning carriage back to their tradingpost again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after several hours of this without any intermission it becomes almost annoying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know what we should have done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however there were plenty of these loaded with dusty tourists and piled high with luggage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed from lucerne to interlaken we had the spectacle among other scenery of an unbroken procession of our talk was mostly anticipatory of what we should see on the downgrade of the brunig by and by after we should pass the summit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all our friends in lucerne had said that to look down upon meiringen and the rushing bluegray river aar and the broad level green valley and across at the mighty alpine precipices that rise straight up to the clouds out of that valley and up at the microscopic chalets perched upon the dizzy eaves of those precipices and winking dimly and fitfully through the drifting veil of vapor and still up and up at the superb oltschiback and the other beautiful cascades that leap from those rugged heights robed in powdery spray ruffled with foam and girdled with rainbowsto look upon these things they say was to look upon the last possibility of the sublime and the enchanting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore as i say we talked mainly of these coming wonders if we were conscious of any impatience it was to get there in favorable season if we felt any anxiety it was that the day might remain perfect and enable us to see those marvels at their best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we approached the kaiserstuhl a part of the harness gave way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in distress for a moment but only a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the foreandaft gear that was brokenthe thing that leads aft from the forward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the wagon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in america this would have been a heavy leathern strap but all over the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the size of your little fingerclothesline is what it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cabs use it private carriages freightcarts and wagons all sorts of vehicles have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in munich i afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fiftyfour halfbarrels of beer i had before noticed that the cabs in heidelberg used itnot new rope but rope that had been in use since abrahams time and i had felt nervous sometimes behind it when the cab was tearing down a hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i had long been accustomed to it now and had even become afraid of the leather strap which belonged in its place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our driver got a fresh piece of clothesline out of his so much for one european fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every country has its own ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may interest the reader to know how they put horses to on the continent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man stands up the horses on each side of the thing that projects from the front end of the wagon and then throws the tangled mess of gear forward through a ring and hauls it aft and passes the other thing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the other horse opposite to the first one after crossing them and bringing the loose end back and then buckles the other thing underneath the horse and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing i spoke of before and puts another thing over each horses head with broad flappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes and puts the iron thing in his mouth for him to grit his teeth on uphill and brings the ends of these things aft over his back after buckling another one around under his neck to hold his head up and hitching another thing on a thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is climbing a hill and then takes the slack of the thing which i mentioned a while ago and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon and hands the other things up to the driver to steer with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never have buckled up a horse myself but i do not think we had four very handsome horses and the driver was very proud of his turnout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would bowl along on a reasonable trot on the highway but when he entered a village he did it on a furious run and accompanied it with a frenzy of ceaseless whipcrackings that sounded like volleys of musketry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tore through the narrow streets and around the sharp curves like a moving earthquake showering his volleys as he went and before him swept a continuous tidal wave of scampering children ducks cats and mothers clasping babies which they had snatched out of the way of the coming destruction and as this living wave washed aside along the walls its elements being safe forgot their fears and turned their admiring gaze upon that gallant driver he was a great man to those villagers with his gaudy clothes and his terrific ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever he stopped to have his cattle watered and fed with loaves of bread the villagers stood around admiring him while he swaggered about the little boys gazed up at his face with humble homage and the landlord brought out foaming mugs of beer and conversed proudly with him while he drank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he mounted his lofty box swung his explosive whip and away he went again like a storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not seen anything like this before since i was a boy and the stage used to flourish the village with the dust flying when we reached the base of the kaiserstuhl we took two more horses we had to toil along with difficulty for an hour and a half or two hours for the ascent was not very gradual but when we passed the backbone and approached the station the driver surpassed all his previous efforts in the way of rush and clatter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not have six horses all the time so he made up to this point we had been in the heart of the william tell region <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hero is not forgotten by any means or held in doubtful veneration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wooden image with his bow drawn above the doors of taverns was a about noon we arrived at the foot of the brunig pass and made a twohour stop at the village hotel another of those clean pretty and thoroughly wellkept inns which are such an astonishment to people who are accustomed to hotels of a dismally different pattern in remote countrytowns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a lake here in the lap of the great mountains the green slopes that rose toward the lower crags were graced with scattered swiss cottages nestling among miniature farms and gardens and from out a leafy carriage after carriage laden with tourists and trunks arrived and the quiet hotel was soon populous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were early at the table dhote and saw the people all come in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were of various nationalities but we were the only americans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next to me sat an english bride and next to her sat her new husband whom she called neddy though he was big enough and stalwart enough to be entitled to his full name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had a pretty little lovers quarrel over what wine they should have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neddy was for obeying the guidebook what that nahsty stuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt nahsty pet its quite good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its oful nahsty neddy and i shahnt drink it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the question was what she must have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said he you know very well papa always has champagne on his table and ive always been used to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neddy made a playful pretense of being distressed about the expense and this amused her so much that she nearly exhausted herself with laughterand this pleased him so much that he repeated his jest a couple of times and added new and killing varieties to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the bride finally recovered she gave neddy a lovebox on the arm well you would have menothing else would do so youll have to make the best of a bad bargain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do order the champagne im oful dry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so with a mock groan which made her laugh again the fact that this young woman had never moistened the selvedge edge of her soul with a less plebeian tipple than champagne had a marked and subduing effect on harris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he believed she belonged to the royal family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we heard two or three different languages spoken by people at the table and guessed out the nationalities of most of the guests to our satisfaction but we failed with an elderly gentleman and his wife and a young girl who sat opposite us and with a gentleman of about thirtyfive who sat three seats beyond harris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we did not hear any of these speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but finally the lastnamed gentleman left while we were not noticing but we looked up as he reached the far end of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stopped there a moment and made his toilet with a pocket comb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he was a german or else he had lived in german hotels long enough to catch the fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the elderly couple and the young girl rose to leave they bowed respectfully to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this national custom is worth six of the other one after dinner we talked with several englishmen and they inflamed our desire to a hotter degree than ever to see the sights of meiringen from the heights of the brunig pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they said the view was marvelous and that one who had seen it once could never forget it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they also spoke of the romantic nature of the road over the pass and how in one place it had been cut through a flank of the solid rock in such a way that the mountain overhung the tourist as he passed by and they furthermore said that the sharp turns in the road and the abruptness of the descent would afford us a thrilling experience for we should go down in a flying gallop and seem to be spinning around the rings of a whirlwind like a drop of whiskey descending the spirals of a corkscrew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got all the information out of these gentlemen that we could need and then to make everything complete i asked them if a body could get hold of a little fruit and milk here and there in case of necessity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they threw up their hands in speechless intimation that the road was simply paved with refreshmentpeddlers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were impatient to get away now and the rest of our twohour stop rather dragged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but finally the set time arrived and we began the ascent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed it was a wonderful road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was smooth and compact and clean and the side next the precipices was guarded all along by dressed stone posts about three feet high placed at short distances apart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the road could not have been better built if napoleon the first had built it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seems to have been the introducer of the sort of roads which europe now uses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all literature which describes life as it existed in england france and germany up to the close of the last century is filled with pictures of coaches and carriages wallowing through these three countries in mud and slush halfwheel deep but after napoleon had floundered through a conquered kingdom he generally arranged things so that the rest of the world could follow dryshod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went on climbing higher and higher and curving hither and thither in the shade of noble woods and with a rich variety and profusion of wild flowers all about us and glimpses of rounded grassy backbones below us occupied by trim chalets and nibbling sheep and other glimpses of far lower altitudes where distance diminished the chalets to toys and obliterated the sheep altogether and every now and then some ermined monarch of the alps swung magnificently into view for a moment then drifted it was an intoxicating trip altogether the exceeding sense of satisfaction that follows a good dinner added largely to the enjoyment the having something especial to look forward to and muse about like the approaching grandeurs of meiringen sharpened the zest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> smoking was never so good before solid comfort was never solider we lay back against the thick cushions silent meditative i rubbed my eyes opened them and started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been dreaming i was at sea and it was a thrilling surprise to wake up and find land all around me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took me a couple seconds to come to as you may say then i took in the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the horses were drinking at a trough in the edge of a town the driver was taking beer harris was snoring at my side the courier with folded arms and bowed head was sleeping on the box two dozen barefooted and bareheaded children were gathered about the carriage with their hands crossed behind gazing up with serious and innocent admiration at the dozing tourists baking there in the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several small girls held nightcapped babies nearly as big as themselves in their arms and even these fat we had slept an hour and a half and missed all the scenery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not need anybody to tell me that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had been a girl i could have cursed for vexation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was i woke up the agent and gave him a piece of my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of being humiliated he only upbraided me for being so wanting in vigilance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said he had expected to improve his mind by coming to europe but a man might travel to the ends of the earth with me and never see anything for i was manifestly endowed with the very genius of ill luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he even tried to get up some emotion about that poor courier who never got a chance to see anything on account of my heedlessness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when i thought i had borne about enough of this kind of talk i threatened to make harris tramp back to the summit and make a report on that scenery we drove sullenly through brienz dead to the seductions of its bewildering array of swiss carvings and the clamorous hoohooing of its cuckoo clocks and had not entirely recovered our spirits when we rattled across a bridge over the rushing blue river and entered the pretty town of interlaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was just about sunset chapter xxxii we located ourselves at the jungfrau hotel one of those huge establishments which the needs of modern travel have created in every attractive spot on the continent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a great gathering at dinner and as usual the table dhote was served by waitresses dressed in the quaint and comely costume of the swiss peasants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this consists of a simple gros de laine trimmed with ashes of roses with overskirt of scare bleu ventre saint gris cut bias on the offside with facings of petit polonaise and narrow insertions of pate de foie gras backstitched to the mise en scene in the form of a jeu desprit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it gives one of these waitresses a woman of forty had sidewhiskers reaching halfway down her jaws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were two fingers broad dark in color pretty thick and the hairs were an inch long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one sees many women on the continent with quite conspicuous mustaches but this was the only woman i saw who had reached the dignity of whiskers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after dinner the guests of both sexes distributed themselves about the front porches and the ornamental grounds belonging to the hotel to enjoy the cool air but as the twilight deepened toward darkness they gathered themselves together in that saddest and solemnest and most constrained of all places the great blank drawingroom which is the chief feature of all continental summer hotels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they grouped themselves about in couples and threes and mumbled there was a small piano in this room a clattery wheezy asthmatic thing certainly the very worst miscarriage in the way of a piano that the world has seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in turn five or six dejected and homesick ladies approached it doubtingly gave it a single inquiring thump and retired with the lockjaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the boss of that instrument was she was a brandnew bride innocent girlish happy in herself and her grave and worshiping stripling of a husband she was about eighteen just out of school free from affections unconscious of that passionless multitude around her and the very first time she smote that old wreck one recognized that it had met its destiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her stripling brought an armful of aged sheetmusic from their room for this bride went heeled as you might sayand bent the bride fetched a swoop with her fingers from one end of the keyboard to the other just to get her bearings as it were and you could see the congregation set their teeth with the agony of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then without any more preliminaries she turned on all the horrors of the battle of prague that venerable shivaree and waded chindeep in the blood of the slain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made a fair and honorable average of two false notes in every five but her soul was in arms and she never stopped to correct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the audience stood it with pretty fair grit for a while but when the cannonade waxed hotter and fiercer and the discord average rose to four in five the procession began to move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few stragglers held their ground ten minutes longer but when the girl began to wring the true inwardness out of the cries of the wounded they struck their colors there never was a completer victory i was the only noncombatant left on the field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would not have deserted my countrywoman anyhow but indeed i had no desires in that direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of us like mediocrity but we all reverence perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this girls music was perfection in its way it was the worst music that i moved up close and never lost a strain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she got through i asked her to play it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did it with a pleased alacrity and a heightened enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made it all discords this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she got an amount of anguish into the cries of the wounded that shed a new light on human suffering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was on the warpath all the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the time crowds of people gathered on the porches and pressed their noses against the windows to look and marvel but the bravest never ventured in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bride went off satisfied and happy with her young fellow when her appetite was finally gorged and the tourists what a change has come over switzerland and in fact all europe during this century <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seventy or eighty years ago napoleon was the only man in europe who could really be called a traveler he was the only man who had devoted his attention to it and taken a powerful interest in it he was the only man who had traveled extensively but now everybody goes everywhere and switzerland and many other regions which were unvisited and unknown remotenesses a hundred years ago are in our days a buzzing hive of restless strangers every summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning when we looked out of our windows we saw a wonderful sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across the valley and apparently quite neighborly and close at hand the giant form of the jungfrau rose cold and white into the clear sky beyond a gateway in the nearer highlands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it reminded me somehow of one of those colossal billows which swells suddenly up beside ones ship at sea sometimes with its crest and shoulders snowy white and the rest of its noble proportions streaked downward with creamy foam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took out my sketchbook and made a little picture i do not regard this as one of my finished works in fact i do not rank it among my works at all it is only a study it is hardly more than what one might call a sketch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other artists have done me the grace to admire it but i am severe in my judgments of my own pictures and this it was hard to believe that that lofty wooded rampart on the left which so overtops the jungfrau was not actually the higher of the two but it was not of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is only two or three thousand feet high and of course has no snow upon it in summer whereas the jungfrau is not much shorter of fourteen thousand feet high and therefore that lowest verge of snow on her side which seems nearly down to the valley level is really about seven thousand feet higher up in the air than the summit of that wooded rampart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the distance that makes the deception <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wooded height is but four or five miles removed from us walking down the street of shops in the forenoon i was attracted by a large picture carved frame and all from a single block of chocolatecolored wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are people who know everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of these had told us that continental shopkeepers always raise their prices on english and americans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many people had told us it was expensive to buy things through a courier whereas i had supposed it was just the reverse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i saw this picture i conjectured that it was worth more than the friend i proposed to buy it for would like to pay but still it was worth while to inquire so i told the courier to step in and ask the price as if he wanted it for himself i told him not to speak in english and above all not to reveal the fact that he was a courier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the courier came presently and reported the price <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said to myself it is a hundred francs too much and so dismissed the matter from my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the afternoon i was passing that place with harris and the picture attracted me again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stepped in to see how much higher broken german would raise the price <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shopwoman named a figure just a hundred francs lower than the courier had named <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said i would take it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after i had given directions as to where it was to be shipped the shipped the shopwoman said if your please do not let your courier know you bought it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what makes you think i have a courier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah that is very simple he told me himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tell mewhy did you charge him more than you are charging me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is very simple also i do not have to pay you a percentage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would have had to pay the courier a percentage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the courier always has his percentage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this case it would have been a hundred francs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the tradesman does not pay a part of it the purchaser pays all of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are occasions when the tradesman and the courier agree upon a price which is twice or thrice the value of the article then the two divide and both get a percentage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it seems to me that the purchaser does all the paying even then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have bought this picture myself therefore why shouldnt the courier know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah indeed it would take all my little profit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would come and demand his hundred francs and i should have to pay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has not done the buying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not dare to refuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would never bring travelers here again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more than that he would denounce me to the other couriers they would divert custom from me and my business would be injured <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went away in a thoughtful frame of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to see why a courier could afford to work for fiftyfive dollars a month and his fares <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a month or two later i was able to understand why a courier did not have to pay any board and lodging and why my hotel bills were always larger when i had him another thing was also explained now apparently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one town i had taken the courier to the bank to do the translating when i drew some money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had sat in the readingroom till the transaction was finished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a clerk had brought the money to me in person and had been exceedingly polite even going so far as to precede me to the door and holding it open for me and bow me out as if i had been a distinguished personage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exchange had been in my favor ever since i had been in europe but just that one time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got simply the face of my draft and no extra francs whereas i had expected to get quite a number of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the first time i had ever used the courier at the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had suspected something then and as long as he remained with me afterward i managed bank matters still if i felt that i could afford the tax i would never travel without a courier for a good courier is a convenience whose value cannot be estimated in dollars and cents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without him travel is a bitter harassment a purgatory of little exasperating annoyances a ceaseless and pitiless punishmenti mean to an irascible man without a courier travel hasnt a ray of pleasure in it anywhere but with him it is a continuous and unruffled delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is always at hand never has to be sent for if your bell is not answered promptlyand it seldom isyou have only to open the door and speak the courier will hear and he will have the order attended to or raise an insurrection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you tell him what day you will start and whither you are goingleave all the rest to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you need not inquire about trains or fares or car changes or hotels or anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the proper time he will put you in a cab or an omnibus and drive you to the train or the boat he has packed your luggage and transferred it he has paid all the bills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other people have preceded you half an hour to scramble for impossible places and lose their tempers but you can take your time the courier has secured your seats for you at the station the crowd mash one another to pulp in the effort to get the weighers attention to their trunks they dispute hotly with these tyrants who are cool and indifferent they get their baggage billets at last and then have another squeeze and another rage over the disheartening business of trying to get them recorded and paid for and still another over the equally disheartening business of trying to get near enough to the ticket office to buy a ticket and now with their tempers gone to the dogs they must stand penned up and packed together laden with wraps and satchels and shawlstraps with the weary wife and babies in the waitingroom till the doors are thrown openand then all hands make a grand final rush to the train find it full and have to stand on the platform and fret until some more cars are put on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are in a condition to kill somebody by this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime you have been sitting in your car smoking on the journey the guard is polite and watchfulwont allow anybody to get into your compartmenttells them you are just recovering from the smallpox and do not like to be disturbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the courier has made everything right with the guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at waystations the courier comes to your compartment to see if you want a glass of water or a newspaper or anything at eatingstations he sends luncheon out to you while the other people scramble and worry in the diningrooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anything breaks about the car you are in and a stationmaster proposes to pack you and your agent into a compartment with strangers the courier reveals to him confidentially that you are a french duke born deaf and dumb and the official comes and makes affable signs that he has ordered a choice car at customhouses the multitude file tediously through hot and irritated and look on while the officers burrow into the trunks and make a mess of everything but you hand your keys to the courier and sit still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps you arrive at your destination in a rainstorm at ten at nightyou generally do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the multitude spend half an hour verifying their baggage and getting it transferred to the omnibuses but the courier puts you into a vehicle without a moments loss of time and when you reach your hotel you find your rooms have been secured two or three days in advance everything is ready you can go at once to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of those other people will have to drift around to two or three hotels in the rain i have not set down half of the virtues that are vested in a good courier but i think i have set down a sufficiency of them to show that an irritable man who can afford one and does not employ him is not a wise economist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my courier was the worst one in europe yet he was a good deal better than none at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it could not pay him to be a better one than he was because i could not afford to buy things through him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a good enough courier for the small amount he got out of his service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes to travel with a courier i have had dealings with some very bad couriers but i have also had dealings with one who might fairly be called perfection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a young polander named joseph n <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke eight languages and seemed to be equally at home in all of them he was shrewd prompt posted and punctual he was fertile in resources and singularly gifted in the matter of overcoming difficulties he not only knew how to do everything in his line but he knew the best ways and the quickest he was handy with children and invalids all his employer needed to do was to take life easy and leave everything to the courier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his address is care of messrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gay son strand london he was formerly a conductor of gays tourist parties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excellent couriers are somewhat rare if the reader is about to travel chapter xxxiii the beautiful giesbach fall is near interlaken on the other side of the lake of brienz and is illuminated every night with those gorgeous theatrical fires whose name i cannot call just at this moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was said to be a spectacle which the tourist ought by no means to miss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was strongly tempted but i could not go there with propriety because one goes in a boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the task which i had set myself was to walk over europe on foot not skim over it in a boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had made a tacit contract with myself it was my duty to abide by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was willing to make boat trips for pleasure but i could it cost me something of a pang to lose that fine sight but i lived down the desire a nd gained in my selfrespect through the triumph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a finer and a grander sight however where i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the mighty dome of the jungfrau softly outlined against the sky and faintly silvered by the starlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was something subduing in the influence of that silent and solemn and awful presence one seemed to meet the immutable the indestructible the eternal face to face and to feel the trivial and fleeting nature of his own existence the more sharply by the contrast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one had the sense of being under the brooding contemplation of a spirit not an inert mass of rocks and icea spirit which had looked down through the slow drift of the ages upon a million vanished races of men and judged them and would judge a million moreand still be there watching unchanged and unchangeable after all life while i was feeling these things i was groping without knowing it toward an understanding of what the spell is which people find in the alps and in no other mountainsthat strange deep nameless influence which once felt cannot be forgottenonce felt leaves always behind it a restless longing to feel it againa longing which is like homesickness a grieving haunting yearning which will plead implore and persecute till it has its will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i met dozens of people imaginative and unimaginative cultivated and uncultivated who had come from far countries and roamed through the swiss alps year after yearthey could not explain why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had come first they said out of idle curiosity because everybody talked about it they had come since because they could not help it and they should keep on coming while they lived for the same reason they had tried to break their chains and stay away but it was futile now they had no desire to break them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> others came nearer formulating what they felt they said they could find perfect rest and peace nowhere else when they were troubled all frets and worries and chafings sank to sleep in the presence of the benignant serenity of the alps the great spirit of the mountain breathed his own peace upon their hurt minds and sore hearts and healed them they could not think base thoughts or do mean and sordid down the road a piece was a kursaalwhatever that may be and we joined the human tide to see what sort of enjoyment it might afford <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the usual openair concert in an ornamental garden with wines beer milk whey grapes etc.the whey and the grapes being necessaries of life to certain invalids whom physicians cannot repair and who only continue to exist by the grace of whey or grapes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these departed spirits told me in a sad and lifeless way that there is no way for him to live but by whey and dearly dearly loved whey he didnt know whey he did but he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after making some other remains preserved from decomposition by the grape system told me that the grapes were of a peculiar breed highly medicinal in their nature and that they were counted out and administered by the grapedoctors as methodically as if they were pills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the new patient if very feeble began with one grape before breakfast took three during breakfast a couple between meals five at luncheon three in the afternoon seven at dinner four for supper and part of a grape just before going to bed by way of a general regulator <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the quantity was gradually and regularly increased according to the needs and capacities of the patient until by and by you would find him disposing of his one grape per second all the day long and his regular barrel he said that men cured in this way and enabled to discard the grape system never afterward got over the habit of talking as if they were dictating to a slow amanuensis because they always made a pause between each two words while they sucked the substance out of an imaginary grape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said these were tedious people to talk with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that men who had been cured by the other process were easily distinguished from the rest of mankind because they always tilted their heads back between every two words and swallowed a swig of imaginary whey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said it was an impressive thing to observe two men who had been cured by the two processes engaged in conversationsaid their pauses and accompanying movements were so continuous and regular that a stranger would think himself in the presence of a couple of automatic machines <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one finds out a great many wonderful things by traveling i did not remain long at the kursaal the music was good enough but it seemed rather tame after the cyclone of that arkansaw expert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides my adventurous spirit had conceived a formidable enterprisenothing less than a trip from interlaken by the gemmi and visp clear to zermatt on foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it was necessary to plan the details and get ready for an early start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the courier this was not the one i have just been speaking of thought that the portier of the hotel would be able to tell us how to find our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he showed us the whole thing on a reliefmap and we could see our route with all its elevations and depressions its villages and its rivers as clearly as if we were sailing over it in a balloon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a reliefmap is a great thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the portier also wrote down each days journey and the nightly hotel on a piece of paper and made our course so plain that we should never be able to get lost without i put the courier in the care of a gentleman who was going to lausanne and then we went to bed after laying out the walkingcostumes and putting them into condition however when we came down to breakfast at am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it looked so much like rain that i hired a twohorse topbuggy for the first third of the journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for two or three hours we jogged along the level road which skirts the beautiful lake of thun with a dim and dreamlike picture of watery expanses and spectral alpine forms always before us veiled in a mellowing mist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a steady downpour set in and hid everything but the nearest objects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we kept the rain out of our faces with umbrellas and away from our bodies with the leather apron of the buggy but the driver sat unsheltered and placidly soaked the weather in and seemed to like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had the road to ourselves the weather began to clear while we were driving up a valley called the kienthal and presently a vast black cloudbank in front of us dissolved away and uncurtained the grand proportions and the soaring loftiness of the blumis alp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a sort of breathtaking surprise for we had not supposed there was anything behind that lowhung blanket of sable cloud but level valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what we had been mistaking for fleeting glimpses of sky away aloft there were really patches of the blumiss snowy crest caught through shredded rents in the drifting we dined in the inn at frutigen and our driver ought to have dined there too but he would not have had time to dine and get drunk both so he gave his mind to making a masterpiece of the latter and succeeded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a german gentleman and his two younglady daughters had been taking their nooning at the inn and when they left just ahead of us it was plain that their driver was as drunk as ours and as happy and goodnatured too which was saying a good deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these rascals overflowed with attentions and information for their guests and with brotherly love for each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they tied their reins and took off their coats and hats so that they might be able to give unencumbered attention to conversation the road was smooth it led up and over and down a continual succession of hills but it was narrow the horses were used to it and could not well get out of it anyhow so why shouldnt the drivers entertain themselves and us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noses of our horses projected sociably into the rear of the forward carriage and as we toiled up the long hills our driver stood up and talked to his friend and his friend stood up and talked back to him with his rear to the scenery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the top was reached and we went flying down the other side there was no change in the program <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i carry in my memory yet the picture of that forward driver on his knees on his high seat resting his elbows on its back and beaming down on his passengers with happy eye and flying hair and jolly red face and offering his card to the old german gentleman while he praised his hack and horses and both teams were whizzing down a long hill with nobody in a position to tell whether toward sunset we entered a beautiful green valley dotted with chalets a cozy little domain hidden away from the busy world in a cloistered nook among giant precipices topped with snowy peaks that seemed to float like islands above the curling surf of the sea of vapor that severed them from the lower world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down from vague and vaporous heights little ruffled zigzag milky currents came crawling and found their way to the verge of one of those tremendous overhanging walls whence they plunged a shaft of silver shivered to atoms in middescent and turned to an air puff of luminous dust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there in grooved depressions among the snowy desolations of the upper altitudes one glimpsed the extremity of a glacier with its seagreen up the valley under a dizzy precipice nestled the village of kandersteg our haltingplace for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were soon there and housed in the hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the waning day had such an inviting influence that we did not remain housed many moments but struck out and followed a roaring torrent of icewater up to its far source in a sort of little grasscarpeted parlor walled in all around by vast precipices and overlooked by clustering summits of ice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the snuggest little croquetground imaginable it was perfectly level and not more than a mile long by half a mile wide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the walls around it were so gigantic and everything about it was on so mighty a scale that it was belittled by contrast to what i have likened it toa cozy and carpeted parlor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so high above the kandersteg valley that there was nothing between it and the snowypeaks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had never been in such intimate relations with the high altitudes before the snowpeaks had always been remote and unapproachable grandeurs hitherto but now we were hobanobif one may use such a seemingly irreverent expression about creations we could see the streams which fed the torrent we had followed issuing from under the greenish ramparts of glaciers but two or three of these instead of flowing over the precipices sank down into the rock and sprang the green nook which i have been describing is called the gasternthal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the glacier streams gather and flow through it in a broad and rushing brook to a narrow cleft between lofty precipices here the rushing brook becomes a mad torrent and goes booming and thundering down toward kandersteg lashing and thrashing its way over and among monster boulders and hurling chance roots and logs about like straws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no lack of cascades along this route <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the path by the side of the torrent was so narrow that one had to look sharp when he heard a cowbell and hunt for a place that was wide enough to accommodate a cow and a christian side by side and such places were not always to be had at an instants notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cows wear churchbells and that is a good idea in the cows for where that torrent is you couldnt hear an ordinary i needed exercise so i employed my agent in setting stranded logs and dead trees adrift and i sat on a boulder and watched them go whirling and leaping head over heels down the boiling torrent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a wonderfully exhilarating spectacle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i had had enough exercise i made the agent take some by running a race with one after dinner we had a walk up and down the kandersteg valley in the soft gloaming with the spectacle of the dying lights of day playing about the crests and pinnacles of the still and solemn upper realm for contrast and text for talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no sounds but the dulled complaining of the torrent and the occasional tinkling of a distant bell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spirit of the place was a sense of deep pervading peace one might dream his life tranquilly away there and not miss the summer departed with the sun and winter came with the stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it grew to be a bitter night in that little hotel backed up against a precipice that had no visible top to it but we kept warm and woke in time in the morning to find that everybody else had left for gemmi three hours before so our little plan of helping that german family principally chapter xxxiv we hired the only guide left to lead us on our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was over seventy but he could have given me ninetenths of his strength and still had all his age entitled him to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shouldered our satchels overcoats and alpenstocks and we set out up the steep path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man soon begged us to hand over our coats and waistcoats to him to carry too and we did it one could not refuse so little a thing to a poor old man like that he should have had them if he had been a hundred when we began that ascent we could see a microscopic chalet perched away up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was on our right across the narrow head of the valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when we got up abreast it on its own level mountains were towering high above on every hand and we saw that its altitude was just about that of the little gasternthal which we had visited the evening before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still it seemed a long way up in the air in that waste and lonely wilderness of rocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had an unfenced grassplot in front of it which seemed about as big as a billiardtable and this grassplot slanted so sharply downward and was so brief and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge of the absolute precipice that it was a shuddery thing to think of a persons venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard there would be nothing for him to seize nothing could keep him from rolling five revolutions would bring him to the edge and over he would go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a frightful distance he would fall!for there are very few birds that fly as high as his startingpoint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would strike and bounce two or three times on his way down but this would be no advantage to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would as soon taking an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such a front yard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would rather in fact for the distance down would be about the same and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not see how the peasants got up to that chalet as we strolled on climbing up higher and higher we were continually bringing neighboring peaks into view and lofty prominence which had been hidden behind lower peaks before so by and by while standing before a group of these giants we looked around for the chalet again there it was away down below us apparently on an inconspicuous ridge in the valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as far below us now as it had been after a while the path led us along a railed precipice and we looked overfar beneath us was the snug parlor again the little gasternthal with its water jets spouting from the face of its rock walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could have dropped a stone into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had been finding the top of the world all alongand always finding a still higher top stealing into view in a disappointing way just ahead when we looked down into the gasternthal we felt pretty sure that we had reached the genuine top at last but it was not so there were much higher altitudes to be scaled yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were still in the pleasant shade of forest trees we were still in a region which was cushioned with beautiful mosses and aglow with the manytinted luster of innumerable we found indeed more interest in the wild flowers than in anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we gathered a specimen or two of every kind which we were unacquainted with so we had sumptuous bouquets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but one of the chief interests lay in chasing the seasons of the year up the mountain and determining them by the presence of flowers and berries which we were acquainted with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance it was the end of august at the level of the sea in the kandersteg valley at the base of the pass we found flowers which would not be due at the sealevel for two or three weeks higher up we entered october and gathered fringed gentians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made no notes and have forgotten the details but the construction of the floral in the high regions we found rich store of the splendid red flower called the alpine rose but we did not find any examples of the ugly swiss favorite called edelweiss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its name seems to indicate that it is a noble flower and that it is white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be noble enough but it is not attractive and it is not white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fuzzy blossom is the color of bad cigar ashes and appears to be made of a cheap quality of gray plush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has a noble and distant way of confining itself to the high altitudes but that is probably on account of its looks it apparently has no monopoly of those upper altitudes however for they are sometimes intruded upon by some of the loveliest of the valley families of wild flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody in the alps wears a sprig of edelweiss in his hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the natives pet and also the tourists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the morning as we loafed along having a good time other pedestrians went staving by us with vigorous strides and with the intent and determined look of men who were walking for a wager <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these wore loose kneebreeches long yarn stockings and hobnailed highlaced walkingshoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were gentlemen who would go home to england or germany and tell how many miles they had beaten the guidebook every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i doubted if they ever had much real fun outside of the mere magnificent exhilaration of the tramp through the green valleys and the breezy heights for they were almost always alone and even the finest scenery loses incalculably when there is no one to enjoy all the morning an endless double procession of mulemounted tourists filed past us along the narrow paththe one procession going the other coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had taken a good deal of trouble to teach ourselves the kindly german custom of saluting all strangers with doffed hat and we resolutely clung to it that morning although it kept us bareheaded most of the time a nd was not always responded to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still we found an interest in the thing because we naturally liked to know who were english and americans among the passersby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all continental natives responded of course so did some of the english and americans but as a general thing these two races gave no sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever a man or a woman showed us cold neglect we spoke up confidently in our own tongue and asked for such information as we happened to need and we always got a reply in the same language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the english and american folk are not less kindly than other races they are only more reserved and that comes of habit and education <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one dreary rocky waste away above the line of vegetation we met a procession of twentyfive mounted young men all from america <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got answering bows enough from these of course for they were of an age to learn to do in rome as rome does at one extremity of this patch of desolation overhung by bare and forbidding crags which husbanded drifts of everlasting snow in their shaded cavities was a small stretch of thin and discouraged grass and a man and a family of pigs were actually living here in some shanties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> consequently this place could be really reckoned as property it had a money value and was doubtless taxed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think it must have marked the limit of real estate in this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be hard to set a money value upon any piece of earth that lies between that spot and the empty realm of space <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that man may claim the distinction of owning the end of the world for if there from here forward we moved through a stormswept and smileless desolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all about us rose gigantic masses crags and ramparts of bare and dreary rock with not a vestige or semblance of plant or tree or flower anywhere or glimpse of any creature that had life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the frost and the tempests of unnumbered ages had battered and hacked at these cliffs with a deathless energy destroying them piecemeal so all the region about their bases was a tumbled chaos of great fragments which had been split off and hurled to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soiled and aged banks of snow lay close about our path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ghastly desolation of the place was as tremendously complete as if dore had furnished the workingplans for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but every now and then through the stern gateways around us we caught a view of some neighboring majestic dome sheathed with glittering ice and displaying its white purity at an elevation compared to which ours was groveling and plebeian and this spectacle always chained ones interest and admiration at once i have just said that there was nothing but death and desolation in these hideous places but i forgot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the most forlorn and arid and dismal one of all where the racked and splintered debris was thickest where the ancient patches of snow lay against the very path where the winds blew bitterest and the general aspect was mournfulest and dreariest and furthest from any suggestion of cheer or hope i found a solitary wee forgetmenot flourishing away not a droop about it anywhere but holding its bright blue star up with the prettiest and gallantest air in the world the only happy spirit the only smiling thing in all that grisly desert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to say cheer up!as long as we are here let us make the best of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i judged she had earned a right to a more hospitable place so i plucked her up and sent her to america to a friend who would respect her for the fight she had made all by her small self to make a whole vast despondent alpine desolation stop breaking its heart over the unalterable and hold up its we stopped for a nooning at a strongly built little inn called the schwarenbach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it sits in a lonely spot among the peaks where it is swept by the trailing fringes of the cloudrack and is rained on and snowed on and pelted and persecuted by the storms nearly every day of its life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the only habitation in the whole close at hand now was a chance for a bloodcurdling alpine adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> close at hand was the snowy mass of the great altels cooling its topknot in the sky and daring us to an ascent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was fired with the idea and immediately made up my mind to procure the necessary guides ropes etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i instructed harris to go to the landlord of the inn and set him about our preparations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime i went diligently to work to read up and find out what this muchtalkedof mountainclimbing was like and how one should go about itfor in these matters i was ignorant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hinchliffs summer months among the alps published it is very difficult to free the mind from excitement on the evening before a grand expedition i saw that i was too calm so i walked the room a while and worked myself into a high excitement but the books next remark that the adventurer must get up at two in the morningcame as near as anything to flatting it all out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however i reinforced it and read on about how mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hinchliff dressed by candlelight and was soon down among the guides who were bustling about in the passage packing provisions and making every preparation for the start the whole sky was blazing with stars larger and brighter than they appear through the dense atmosphere breathed by inhabitants of the lower parts of the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed actually suspended from the dark vault of heaven and their gentle light shed a fairylike gleam over the snowfields around the foot of the matterhorn which raised its stupendous pinnacle on high penetrating to the heart of the great bear and crowning itself with a diadem of his magnificent stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a sound disturbed the deep tranquillity of the night except the distant roar of streams which rush from the high plateau of the st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theodule glacier and fall headlong over precipitous rocks till they lose themselves in the mazes of the gorner glacier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took his hot toast and coffee and then about half past three his caravan of ten men filed away from the riffel hotel and began the steep climb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at half past five he happened to turn around and beheld the glorious spectacle of the matterhorn just touched by the rosyfingered morning and looking like a huge pyramid of fire rising out of the barren ocean of ice and rock around it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the breithorn and the dent blanche caught the radiant glow but the intervening mass of monte rosa made it necessary for us to climb many long hours before we could hope to see the sun himself yet the whole air soon grew warmer after the splendid birth of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gazed at the lofty crown of monte rosa and the wastes of snow that guarded its steep approaches and the chief guide delivered the opinion that no man could conquer their awful heights and put his foot upon that summit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they toiled up and up and still up they passed the grand plateau then toiled up a steep shoulder of the mountain clinging like flies to its rugged face and now they were confronted by a tremendous wall from which great blocks of ice and snow were evidently in the habit of falling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they turned aside to skirt this wall and gradually ascended until their way was barred by a maze of gigantic snow crevicesso they turned aside again and began a long climb of sufficient steepness to make a zigzag course necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fatigue compelled them to halt frequently for a moment or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at one of these halts somebody called out look at mont blanc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we were at once made aware of the very great height we had attained by actually seeing the monarch of the alps and his attendant satellites right over the top of the breithorn itself at least feet high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these people moved in single file and were all tied to a strong rope at regular distances apart so that if one of them slipped on those giddy heights the others could brace themselves on their alpenstocks and save him from darting into the valley thousands of feet below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by and by they came to an icecoated ridge which was tilted up at a sharp angle and had a precipice on one side of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had to climb this so the guide in the lead cut steps in the ice with his hatchet and as fast as he took his toes out of one of these slight holes the toes slowly and steadily we kept on our way over this dangerous part of the ascent and i dare say it was fortunate for some of us that attention was distracted from the head by the paramount necessity of looking after the feet for while on the left the incline of ice was so steep that it would be impossible for any man to save himself in case of a slip unless the others could hold him up on the right we might drop a pebble from the hand over precipices of unknown extent down upon the tremendous great caution therefore was absolutely necessary and in this exposed situation we were attacked by all the fury of that grand enemy of aspirants to monte rosaa severe and bitterly cold wind from the north <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fine powdery snow was driven past us in the clouds penetrating the interstices of our clothes and the pieces of ice which flew from the blows of peters ax were whisked into the air and then dashed over the precipice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had quite enough to do to prevent ourselves from being served in the same ruthless fashion and now and then in the more violent gusts of wind were glad to stick our alpenstocks into the ice and hold on hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having surmounted this perilous steep they sat down and took a brief rest with their backs against a sheltering rock and their heels dangling over a bottomless abyss then they climbed to the base of another ridgea more the whole of the ridge was exceedingly narrow and the fall on each side desperately steep but the ice in some of these intervals between the masses of rock assumed the form of a mere sharp edge almost like a knife these places though not more than three or four short paces in length looked uncommonly awkward but like the sword leading true believers to the gates of paradise they must needs be passed before we could attain to the summit of our ambition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these were in one or two places so narrow that in stepping over them with toes well turned out for greater security one end of the foot projected over the awful precipice on the right while the other was on the beginning of the ice slope on the left which was scarcely less steep than the rocks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on these occasions peter would take my hand and each of us stretching as far as we could he was thus enabled to get a firm footing two paces or rather more from me whence a spring would probably bring him to the rock on the other side then turning around he called to me to come and taking a couple of steps carefully i was met at the third by his outstretched hand ready to clasp mine and in a moment stood by his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others followed in much the same fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once my right foot slipped on the side toward the precipice but i threw out my left arm in a moment so that it caught the icy edge under my armpit as i fell and supported me considerably at the same instant i cast my eyes down the side on which i had slipped and contrived to plant my right foot on a piece of rock as large as a cricketball which chanced to protrude through the ice on the very edge of the precipice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being thus anchored fore and aft as it were i believe i could easily have recovered myself even if i had been alone though it must be confessed the situation would have been an awful one as it was however a jerk from peter settled the matter very soon and i was on my legs all right in an instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rope is an immense help in places of this kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now they arrived at the base of a great knob or dome veneered with ice and powdered with snowthe utmost summit the last bit of solidity between them and the hollow vault of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they set to work with their hatchets and were soon creeping insectlike up its surface with their heels projecting over the thinnest kind of nothingness thickened up a little with a few wandering shreds and films of cloud moving in a lazy procession far below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently one mans toehold broke and he fell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he dangled in midair at the end of the rope like a spider a little bit later the party stood upon the wee pedestal of the very summit in a driving wind and looked out upon the vast green expanses of italy and a shoreless when i had read thus far harris broke into the room in a noble excitement and said the ropes and the guides were secured and asked if i was ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said i believed i wouldnt ascend the altels this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said alpclimbing was a different thing from what i had supposed it was and so i judged we had better study its points a little more before we went definitely into it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i told him to retain the guides and order them to follow us to zermatt because i meant to use them there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said i could feel the spirit of adventure beginning to stir in me and was sure that the fell fascination of alpclimbing would soon be upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said he could make up his mind to it that we would do a deed before we were a week older which would make the hair of the timid this made harris happy and filled him with ambitious anticipations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went at once to tell the guides to follow us to zermatt and bring all their paraphernalia chapter xxxv a great and priceless thing is a new interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how it takes possession of a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how it clings to him how it rides him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i strode onward from the schwarenback hostelry a changed man a reorganized personality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walked into a new world i saw with new eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been looking aloft at the giant showpeaks only as things to be worshiped for their grandeur and magnitude and their unspeakable grace of form i looked up at them now as also things to be conquered and climbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my sense of their grandeur and their noble beauty was neither lost nor impaired i had gained a new interest in the mountains without losing the old ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed the steep lines up inch by inch with my eye and noted the possibility or impossibility of following them with my feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i saw a shining helmet of ice projecting above the clouds i tried to imagine i saw files of black specks toiling up it roped together with a we skirted the lonely little lake called the daubensee and presently passed close by a glacier on the right a thing like a great river frozen solid in its flow and broken square off like a wall at its mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we came upon a new board shanty and found some men engaged in building a stone house so the schwarenback was soon to have a rival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we bought a bottle or so of beer here at any rate they called it beer but i knew by the price that it was dissolved jewelry and i perceived by the we were surrounded by a hideous desolation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stepped forward to a sort of jumpingoff place and were confronted by a startling contrast we seemed to look down into fairyland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two or three thousand feet below us was a bright green level with a pretty town in its midst and a silvery stream winding among the meadows the charming spot was walled in on all sides by gigantic precipices clothed with pines and over the pines out of the softened distances rose the snowy domes and peaks of the monte rosa region <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how exquisitely green and beautiful that little valley down there was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the distance was not great enough to obliterate details it only made them little and mellow and dainty like landscapes and towns seen through the wrong end of a spyglass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right under us a narrow ledge rose up out of the valley with a green slanting benchshaped top and grouped about upon this greenbaize bench were a lot of black and white sheep which looked merely like oversized worms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bench seemed lifted well up into our neighborhood we began our descent now by the most remarkable road i have ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wound it corkscrew curves down the face of the colossal precipicea narrow way with always the solid rock wall at one elbow and perpendicular nothingness at the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we met an everlasting procession of guides porters mules litters and tourists climbing up this steep and muddy path and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a tolerably fat mule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always took the inside when i heard or saw the mule coming and flattened myself against the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i preferred the inside of course but i should have had to take it anyhow because the mule prefers the outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mules preferenceon a precipiceis a thing to be respected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well his choice is always the outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his life is mostly devoted to carrying bulky panniers and packages which rest against his bodytherefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge of mountain paths to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or banks on the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he goes into the passenger business he absurdly clings to his old habit and keeps one leg of his passenger always dangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that passengers heart is in the highlands so to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more than once i saw a mules hind foot cave over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into the bottom abyss and i noticed that upon these occasions there was one place where an eighteeninch breadth of light masonry had been added to the verge of the path and as there was a very sharp turn here a panel of fencing had been set up there at some time as a protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this panel was old and gray and feeble and the light masonry had been loosened by recent rains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a young american girl came along on a mule and in making the turn the mules hind foot caved all the loose masonry and one of the fenceposts overboard the mule gave a violent lurch inboard to save himself and succeeded in the effort but that girl turned as white as the snows of mont blanc the path was simply a groove cut into the face of the precipice there was a fourfoot breadth of solid rock under the traveler and fourfoot breadth of solid rock just above his head like the roof of a narrow porch he could look out from this gallery and see a sheer summitless and bottomless wall of rock before him across a gorge or crack a biscuits toss in width but he could not see the bottom of his own precipice unless he lay down and projected his nose over the edge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every few hundred yards at particularly bad places one came across a panel or so of plank fencing but they were always old and weak and they generally leaned out over the chasm and did not make any rash promises to hold up people who might need support <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was one of these panels which had only its upper board left a pedestrianizing english youth came tearing down the path was seized with an impulse to look over the precipice and without an instants thought he threw his weight upon that crazy board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never made a gasp before that came so near suffocating me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the english youths face simply showed a lively surprise but nothing more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went swinging along valleyward again as if he did not know he had just swindled a coroner by the the alpine litter is sometimes like a cushioned box made fast between the middles of two long poles and sometimes it is a chair with a back to it and a support for the feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is carried by relays of strong porters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the motion is easier than that of any other conveyance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we met a few men and a great many ladies in litters it seemed to me that most of the ladies looked pale and nauseated their general aspect gave me the idea that they were patiently enduring a horrible suffering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a rule they looked at their laps and left the scenery but the most frightened creature i saw was a led horse that overtook us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor fellow he had been born and reared in the grassy levels of the kandersteg valley and had never seen anything like this hideous place before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every few steps he would stop short glance wildly out from the dizzy height and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as violently as if he had been running a race and all the while he quaked from head to heel as with a palsy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a handsome fellow and he made a fine statuesque picture of terror but it was pitiful to see this dreadful path has had its tragedy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baedeker with his the descent on horseback should be avoided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a comtesse dherlincourt fell from her saddle over the precipice and was killed on the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we looked over the precipice there and saw the monument which commemorates the event <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it stands in the bottom of the gorge in a place which has been hollowed out of the rock to protect it from the torrent and the storms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our old guide never spoke but when spoken to and then limited himself to a syllable or two but when we asked him about this tragedy he showed a strong interest in the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said the countess was very pretty and very younghardly out of her girlhood in fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was newly married and was on her bridal tour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young husband was riding a little in advance one guide was leading the husbands horse another was leading the brides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the guide that was leading the husbands horse happened to glance back and there was that poor young thing sitting up staring out over the precipice and her face began to bend downward a little and she put up her two hands slowly and met itsoand put them flat against her eyessoand then she sank out of the saddle with a sharp shriek and one caught only the flash of a dress and it was all over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah yes that guide saw these thingsyes he saw them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw them all just as i have told you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah yes he saw them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this had been the one event of the old mans life so one may be sure he had forgotten no detail connected with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we listened to all he had to say about what was done and what happened and what was said after the sorrowful occurrence when we had wound down toward the valley until we were about on the last spiral of the corkscrew harriss hat blew over the last remaining bit of precipicea small cliff a hundred or hundred and fifty feet highand sailed down toward a steep slant composed of rough chips and fragments which the weather had flaked away from the precipices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went leisurely down there expecting to find it without any trouble but we had made a mistake as to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hunted during a couple of hoursnot because the old straw hat was valuable but out of curiosity to find out how such a thing could manage to conceal itself in open ground where there was nothing left for it to hide behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when one is reading in bed and lays his paperknife down he cannot find it again if it is smaller than a saber that hat was as stubborn as any paperknife could have been and we finally had to give it up but we found a fragment that had once belonged to an operaglass and by digging around and turning over the rocks we gradually collected all the lenses and the cylinders and the various odds and ends that go to making up a complete operaglass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we afterward had the thing reconstructed and the owner can have his adventurous lostproperty by submitting proofs and paying costs of rehabilitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had hopes of finding the owner there distributed around amongst the rocks for it would have made an elegant paragraph but we were disappointed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still we were far from being disheartened for there was a considerable area which we had not thoroughly searched we were satisfied he was there somewhere so we resolved to wait over a day at then we sat down to polish off the perspiration and arrange about what we would do with him when we got him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harris was for contributing him to the british museum but i was for mailing him to his widow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the difference between harris and me harris is all for display i am all for the simple right even though i lose money by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harris argued in favor of his proposition against mine i argued in favor of mine and against his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the discussion warmed into a dispute the dispute warmed into a quarrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and my mind is made up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the museum may whistle when it gets him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the widow may save herself the trouble of whistling for i will see that she never gets him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me that you are taking on a good many airs about these remains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont quite see what youve got to say about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got all to say about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd never have been thought of if i hadnt found their operaglass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the corpse belongs to me and ill do as i please with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was leader of the expedition and all discoveries achieved by it naturally belonged to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was entitled to these remains and could have enforced my right but rather than have bad blood about the matter i said we would toss up for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i threw heads and won but it was a barren victory for although we spent all the next day searching we never found a bone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot the town in the valley is called leuk or leukerbad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we pointed our course toward it down a verdant slope which was adorned with fringed gentians and other flowers and presently entered the narrow alleys of the outskirts and waded toward the middle of the town through liquid fertilizer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they ought to either pave that village or harriss body was simply a chamoispasture his person was populous with the little hungry pests his skin when he stripped was splotched like a scarletfever patients so when we were about to enter one of the leukerbad inns and he noticed its sign chamois hotel he refused to stop there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said the chamois was plentiful enough without hunting up hotels where they made a specialty of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was indifferent for the chamois is a creature that will neither bite me nor abide with me but to calm harris at the table dhote we had this for an incident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a very grave manin fact his gravity amounted to solemnity and almost to austeritysat opposite us and he was tight but doing his best to appear sober <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took up a corked bottle of wine tilted it over his glass awhile then set it out of the way with a contented look and went presently he put his glass to his mouth and of course found it empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked puzzled and glanced furtively and suspiciously out of the corner of his eye at a benignant and unconscious old lady who sat at his right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shook his head as much as to say no she couldnt have done it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tilted the corked bottle over his glass again meantime searching around with his watery eye to see if anybody was watching him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ate a few mouthfuls raised his glass to his lips and of course it was still empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he bent an injured and accusing sideglance upon that unconscious old lady which was a study to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went on eating and gave no sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took up his glass and his bottle with a wise private nod of his head and set them gravely on the lefthand side of his plate poured himself another imaginary drinkwent to work with his knife and fork once morepresently lifted his glass with good confidence and found it empty this was almost a petrifying surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he straightened himself up in his chair and deliberately and sorrowfully inspected the busy old ladies at his elbows first one and then the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last he softly pushed his plate away set his glass directly in front of him held on to it with his left hand and proceeded to pour with his right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time he observed that nothing came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned the bottle clear upside down still nothing issued from it a plaintive look came into his face and he said as if ic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he set the bottle down it was at that table dhote too that i had under inspection the largest lady i have ever seen in private life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was over seven feet high and magnificently proportioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what had first called my attention to her was my stepping on an outlying flange of her foot and hearing from up toward the ceiling a deep pardon msieu but you encroach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was when we were coming through the hall and the place was dim and i could see her only vaguely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing which called my attention to her the second time was that at a table beyond ours were two very pretty girls and this great lady came in and sat down between them and me and blotted out my view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a handsome face and she was very finely formedperfected formed i should say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she made everybody around her look trivial and commonplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ladies near her looked like children and the men about her looked mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they looked like failures and they looked as if they felt so too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat with her back to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw such a back in my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would have so liked to see the moon rise over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole congregation waited under one pretext or another till she finished her dinner and went out they wanted to see her at full altitude and they found it worth tarrying for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she filled ones idea of what an empress ought to be when she rose up in her unapproachable grandeur and moved we were not at leuk in time to see her at her heaviest weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had suffered from corpulence and had come there to get rid of her extra flesh in the baths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five weeks of soaking five uninterrupted hours of it every dayhad accomplished those baths remove fat and also skindiseases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the patients remain in the great tanks for hours at a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dozen gentlemen and ladies occupy a tank together and amuse themselves with rompings and various games <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have floating desks and tables and they read or lunch or play chess in water that is breastdeep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tourist can step in and view this novel spectacle if he chooses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a poorbox and he will have to contribute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are several of these big bathinghouses and you can always tell when you are near one of them by the romping noises and shouts of laughter that proceed from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water is running water and changes all the time else a patient with a ringworm might take the bath with only a partial success since while he was ridding himself of the next morning we wandered back up the green valley leisurely with the curving walls of those bare and stupendous precipices rising into the clouds before us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had never seen a clean bare precipice stretching up five thousand feet above me before and i never shall expect to see another one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they exist perhaps but not in places where one can easily get close to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this pile of stone is peculiar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from its base to the soaring tops of its mighty towers all its lines and all its details vaguely suggest human architecture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are rudimentary bowwindows cornices chimneys demarcations of stories etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could sit and stare up there and study the features and exquisite graces of this grand structure bit by bit and day after day and never weary his interest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the termination toward the town observed in profile is the perfection of shape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it comes down out of the clouds in a succession of rounded colossal terracelike projectionsa stairway for the gods at its head spring several lofty stormscarred towers one after another with faint films of vapor curling always about them like spectral banners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there were a king whose realms included the whole world here would be the place meet and proper for such a monarch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would only need to hollow it out and put in the electric light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our search for those remains having failed we inspected with a glass the dim and distant track of an oldtime avalanche that once swept down from some pinegrown summits behind the town and swept away the houses and buried the people then we struck down the road that leads toward the rhone to see the famous ladders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these perilous things are built against the perpendicular face of a cliff two or three hundred feet high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the peasants of both sexes were climbing up and down them with heavy loads on their backs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ordered harris to make the ascent so i could put the thrill and horror of it in my book and he accomplished the feat successfully though a subagent for three francs which i paid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it makes me shudder yet when i think of what i felt when i was clinging there between heaven and earth in the person of that proxy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times the world swam around me and i could hardly keep from letting go so dizzying was the appalling danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many a person would have given up and descended but i stuck to my task and would not yield until i had accomplished it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt a just pride in my exploit but i would not have repeated it for the wealth of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall break my neck yet with some such foolhardy performance for warnings never seem to have any lasting effect on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the people of the hotel found that i had been climbing those crazy ladders it made me an object of next morning early we drove to the rhone valley and took the train for visp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there we shouldered our knapsacks and things and set out on foot in a tremendous rain up the winding gorge toward zermatt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hour after hour we slopped along by the roaring torrent and under noble lesser alps which were clothed in rich velvety green all the way up and had little atomy swiss homes perched the rain continued to pour and the torrent to boom and we continued to enjoy both <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the one spot where this torrent tossed its white mane highest and thundered loudest and lashed the big boulders fiercest the canton had done itself the honor to build the flimsiest wooden bridge that exists in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while we were walking over it along with a party of horsemen i noticed that even the larger raindrops made it shake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i called harriss attention to it and he noticed it too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me that if i owned an elephant that was a keepsake and i thought a good deal of him i would think twice we climbed up to the village of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholas about half past four in the afternoon waded ankledeep through the fertilizerjuice and stopped at a new and nice hotel close by the little church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stripped and went to bed and sent our clothes down to be baked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the horde of soaked tourists did the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that chaos of clothing got mixed in the kitchen and there were consequences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not get back the same drawers i sent down when our things came up at sixfifteen i got a pair on a new plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were merely a pair of white rufflecuffed absurdities hitched together at the top with a narrow band and they did not come quite down to my knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were pretty enough but they made me feel like two people and disconnected at that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man must have been an idiot that got himself up like that to rough it in the swiss mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shirt they brought me was shorter than the drawers and hadnt any sleeves to itat least it hadnt anything more than what mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darwin would call rudimentary sleeves these had edging around them but the bosom was ridiculously plain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the knit silk undershirt they brought me was on a new plan and was really a sensible thing it opened behind and had pockets in it to put your shoulderblades in but they did not seem to fit mine and so i found it a sort of uncomfortable garment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gave my bobtail coat to somebody else and sent me an ulster suitable for a giraffe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to tie my collar on because there was no button behind on that foolish little shirt when i was dressed for dinner at sixthirty i was too loose in some places and too tight in others and altogether i felt slovenly and illconditioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however the people at the table dhote were no better off than i was they had everybodys clothes but their own on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a long stranger recognized his ulster as soon as he saw the tail of it following me in but nobody claimed my shirt or my drawers though i described them as well as i was able <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gave them to the chambermaid that night when i went to bed and she probably found the owner for my own there was a lovable english clergyman who did not get to the table dhote at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his breeches had turned up missing and without any equivalent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said he was not more particular than other people but he had noticed that a clergyman at dinner without chapter xxxvi we did not oversleep at st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then rest his soul for a true seaman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as for you john silver long youve been a mate of mine but youre mate of mine no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i die like a dog ill die in my dooty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kill me too if you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with that this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was not destined to go far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a cry john seized the branch of a tree whipped the crutch out of his armpit and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it struck poor tom point foremost and with stunning violence right between the shoulders in the middle of his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his hands flew up he gave a sort of gasp and fell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether he were injured much or little none could ever tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like enough to judge from the sound his back was broken on the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had no time given him to recover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silver agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from my place of ambush i could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know what it rightly is to faint but i do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist silver and the birds and the tall spyglass hilltop going round and round and topsyturvy before my eyes and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together his crutch under his arm his hat upon his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just before him tom lay motionless upon the sward but the murderer minded him not a whit cleansing his bloodstained knife the while upon a wisp of grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything else was unchanged the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain and i could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now john put his hand into his pocket brought out a whistle and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not tell of course the meaning of the signal but it instantly awoke my fears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had already slain two of the honest people after tom and alan might not i come next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly i began to extricate myself and crawl back again with what speed and silence i could manage to the more open portion of the wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i did so i could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades and this sound of danger lent me wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i was clear of the thicket i ran as i never ran before scarce minding the direction of my flight so long as it led me from the murderers and as i ran fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed could anyone be more entirely lost than i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the gun fired how should i dare to go down to the boats among those fiends still smoking from their crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm and therefore of my fatal knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was all over i thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goodbye to the hispaniola goodbye to the squire the doctor and the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this while as i say i was still running and without taking any notice i had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the liveoaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mingled with these were a few scattered pines some fifty some nearer seventy feet high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the side of the hill which was here steep and stony a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my eyes turned instinctively in that direction and i saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what it was whether bear or man or monkey i could in no wise tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed dark and shaggy more i knew not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was now it seemed cut off upon both sides behind me the murderers before me this lurking nondescript <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and immediately i began to prefer the dangers that i knew to those i knew not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods and i turned on my heel and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly the figure reappeared and making a wide circuit began to head me off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was tired at any rate but had i been as fresh as when i rose i could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer running manlike on two legs but unlike any man that i had ever seen stooping almost double as it ran <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet a man it was i could no longer be in doubt about that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to recall what i had heard of cannibals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was within an ace of calling for help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the mere fact that he was a man however wild had somewhat reassured me and my fear of silver began to revive in proportion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood still therefore and cast about for some method of escape and as i was so thinking the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as i remembered i was not defenceless courage glowed again in my heart and i set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk but he must have been watching me closely for as soon as i began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he hesitated drew back came forward again and at last to my wonder and confusion threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that i once more stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben gunn he answered and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward like a rusty lock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im poor ben gunn i am and i havent spoke with a christian these three years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his skin wherever it was exposed was burnt by the sun even his lips were black and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all the beggarmen that i had seen or fancied he was the chief for raggedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was clothed with tatters of old ships canvas and old seacloth and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings brass buttons bits of stick and loops of tarry gaskin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about his waist he wore an old brassbuckled leather belt which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had heard the word and i knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marooned three years agone he continued and lived on goats since then and berries and oysters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wherever a man is says i a man can do for himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but mate my heart is sore for christian diet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mightnt happen to have a piece of cheese about you now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well manys the long night ive dreamed of cheesetoasted mostlyand woke up again and here i were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever i can get aboard again said i you shall have cheese by the stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket smoothing my hands looking at my boots and generally in the intervals of his speech showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever you can get aboard again says you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why now whos to hinder you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not you i know was my reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and right you was he cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now youwhat do you call yourself mate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jim jim says he quite pleased apparently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well now jim ive lived that rough as youd be ashamed to hear of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now for instance you wouldnt think i had had a pious motherto look at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why no not in particular i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah well said he but i hadremarkable pious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i was a civil pious boy and could rattle off my catechism that fast as you couldnt tell one word from another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and heres what it come to jim and it begun with chuckfarthen on the blessed gravestones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what it begun with but it went furthern that and so my mother told me and predicked the whole she did the pious woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it were providence that put me here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive thought it all out in this here lonely island and im back on piety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont catch me tasting rum so much but just a thimbleful for luck of course the first chance i have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im bound ill be good and i see the way to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and jimlooking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisperim rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude and i suppose i must have shown the feeling in my face for he repeated the statement hotly rich <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ill tell you what ill make a man of you jim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah jim youll bless your stars you will you was the first that found me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now jim you tell me true that aint flints ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this i had a happy inspiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to believe that i had found an ally and i answered him at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not flints ship and flint is dead but ill tell you true as you ask methere are some of flints hands aboard worse luck for the rest of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes the cook and the ringleader too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was still holding me by the wrist and at that he give it quite a wring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you was sent by long john he said im as good as pork and i know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but where was you do you suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had made my mind up in a moment and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard me with the keenest interest and when i had done he patted me on the head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre a good lad jim he said and youre all in a clove hitch aint you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you just put your trust in ben gunnben gunns the man to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you think it likely now that your squire would prove a liberalminded one in case of helphim being in a clove hitch as you remark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him the squire was the most liberal of men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aye but you see returned ben gunn i didnt mean giving me a gate to keep and a suit of livery clothes and such thats not my mark jim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i mean is would he be likely to come down to the toon of say one thousand pounds out of money thats as good as a mans own already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure he would said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as it was all hands were to share <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added with a look of great shrewdness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i cried the squires a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besides if we got rid of the others we should want you to help work the vessel home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah said he so you would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he seemed very much relieved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ill tell you what he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so much ill tell you and no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i were in flints ship when he buried the treasure he and six alongsix strong seamen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they was ashore nigh on a week and us standing off and on in the old walrus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one fine day up went the signal and here come flint by himself in a little boat and his head done up in a blue scarf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was getting up and mortal white he looked about the cutwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there he was you mind and the six all deaddead and buried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he done it not a man aboard us could make out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was battle murder and sudden death leastwayshim against six <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy bones was the mate long john he was quartermaster and they asked him where the treasure was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah says he you can go ashore if you like and stay he says but as for the ship shell beat up for more by thunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i was in another ship three years back and we sighted this island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boys said i heres flints treasure lets land and find it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the capn was displeased at that but my messmates were all of a mind and landed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twelve days they looked for it and every day they had the worse word for me until one fine morning all hands went aboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for you benjamin gunn says they heres a musket they says and a spade and pickaxe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can stay here and find flints money for yourself they says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well jim three years have i been here and not a bite of christian diet from that day to this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now you look here look at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do i look like a man before the mast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor i werent neither i says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with that he winked and pinched me hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just you mention them words to your squire jim he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor he werent neitherthats the words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three years he were the man of this island light and dark fair and rain and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer says you and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother so be as shes alive youll say but the most part of gunns time this is what youll saythe most part of his time was took up with another matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then youll give him a nip like i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he pinched me again in the most confidential manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he continued then youll up and youll say this gunn is a good man youll say and he puts a precious sight more confidencea precious sight mind thatin a genleman born than in these genleman of fortune having been one hisself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i said i dont understand one word that youve been saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but thats neither here nor there for how am i to get on board <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah said he thats the hitch for sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well theres my boat that i made with my two hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i keep her under the white rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the worst come to the worst we might try that after dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for just then although the sun had still an hour or two to run all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i began to run towards the anchorage my terrors all forgotten while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> left left says he keep to your left hand mate jim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theers where i killed my first goat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont come down here now theyre all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of benjamin gunn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and theres the cetemery cemetery he must have meant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i come here and prayed nows and thens when i thought maybe a sunday would be about doo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it werent quite a chapel but it seemed more solemn like and then says you ben gunn was shorthandedno chapling nor so much as a bible and a flag you says <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he kept talking as i ran neither expecting nor receiving any answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cannonshot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another pause and then not a quarter of a mile in front of me i beheld the union jack flutter in the air above a wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> narrative continued by the doctor how the it was about half past onethree bells in the sea phrasethat the two boats went ashore from the hispaniola <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain the squire and i were talking matters over in the cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had there been a breath of wind we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us slipped our cable and away to sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the wind was wanting and to complete our helplessness down came hunter with the news that jim hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it never occurred to us to doubt jim hawkins but we were alarmed for his safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the men in the temper they were in it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pitch was bubbling in the seams the nasty stench of the place turned me sick if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery it was in that abominable anchorage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each hard by where the river runs in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them was whistling lillibullero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> waiting was a strain and it was decided that hunter and i should go ashore with the jollyboat in quest of information <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gigs had leaned to their right but hunter and i pulled straight in in the direction of the stockade upon the chart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance lillibullero stopped off and i could see the pair discussing what they ought to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had they gone and told silver all might have turned out differently but they had their orders i suppose and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to lillibullero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a slight bend in the coast and i steered so as to put it between us even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i jumped out and came as near running as i durst with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not gone a hundred yards when i reached the stockade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was how it was a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well on the knoll and enclosing the spring they had clapped a stout log house fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all round this they had cleared a wide space and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high without door or opening too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people in the loghouse had them in every way they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all they wanted was a good watch and food for short of a complete surprise they might have held the place against a regiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what particularly took my fancy was the spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the hispaniola with plenty of arms and ammunition and things to eat and excellent wines there had been one thing overlookedwe had no water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not new to violent deathi have served his royal highness the duke of cumberland and got a wound myself at fontenoy but i know my pulse went dot and carry one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jim hawkins is gone was my first thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is something to have been an old soldier but more still to have been a doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no time to dillydally in our work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so now i made up my mind instantly and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jollyboat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by good fortune hunter pulled a good oar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we made the water fly and the boat was soon alongside and i aboard the schooner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found them all shaken as was natural <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the squire was sitting down as white as a sheet thinking of the harm he had led us to the good soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and one of the six forecastle hands was little better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres a man says captain smollett nodding towards him new to this work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came nighhand fainting doctor when he heard the cry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another touch of the rudder and that man would join us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told my plan to the captain and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we put old redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hunter brought the boat round under the sternport and joyce and i set to work loading her with powder tins muskets bags of biscuits kegs of pork a cask of cognac and my invaluable medicine chest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime the squire and the captain stayed on deck and the latter hailed the coxswain who was the principal man aboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hands he said here are two of us with a brace of pistols each <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any one of you six make a signal of any description that mans dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were a good deal taken aback and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion thinking no doubt to take us on the rear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when they saw redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley they went about ship at once and a head popped out again on deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the head popped back again and we heard no more for the time of these six very fainthearted seamen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time tumbling things in as they came we had the jollyboat loaded as much as we dared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joyce and i got out through the sternport and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lillibullero was dropped again and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point one of them whipped ashore and disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats but i feared that silver and the others might be close at hand and all might very well be lost by trying for too much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all three made the first journey heavily laden and tossed our stores over the palisade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then leaving joyce to guard themone man to be sure but with half a dozen muskets hunter and i returned to the jollyboat and loaded ourselves once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we proceeded without pausing to take breath till the whole cargo was bestowed when the two servants took up their position in the block house and i with all my power sculled back to the hispaniola <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had the advantage of numbers of course but we had the advantage of arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not one of the men ashore had a musket and before they could get within range for pistol shooting we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a halfdozen at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the squire was waiting for me at the stern window all his faintness gone from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he caught the painter and made it fast and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pork powder and biscuit was the cargo with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and redruth and the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun on the clean sandy bottom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time the tide was beginning to ebb and the ship was swinging round to her anchor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs and though this reassured us for joyce and hunter who were well to the eastward it warned our party to be off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat which we then brought round to the ships counter to be handier for captain smollett <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now men said he do you hear me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no answer from the forecastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its to you abraham grayits to you i am speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> smollett a little louder i am leaving this ship and i order you to follow your captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you are a good man at bottom and i dare say not one of the lot of yous as bad as he makes out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have my watch here in my hand i give you thirty seconds to join me in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come my fine fellow continued the captain dont hang so long in stays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a sudden scuffle a sound of blows and out burst abraham gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im with you sir said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us and we had shoved off and given way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were clear out of the ship but not yet ashore in our stockade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> narrative continued by the doctor the jollyboats this fifth trip was quite different from any of the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five grown men and three of themtrelawney redruth and the captainover six feet high was already more than she was meant to carry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> add to that the powder pork and breadbags <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several times we shipped a little water and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain made us trim the boat and we got her to lie a little more evenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the same we were afraid to breathe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the second place the ebb was now makinga strong rippling current running westward through the basin and then southard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landingplace behind the point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs where the pirates might appear at any moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot keep her head for the stockade sir said i to the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was steering while he and redruth two fresh men were at the oars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tide keeps washing her down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could you pull a little stronger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not without swamping the boat said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must bear up sir if you pleasebear up until you see youre gaining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until i had laid her head due east or just about right angles to the way we ought to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well never get ashore at this rate said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if its the only course that we can lie sir we must even lie it returned the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see sir he went on if once we dropped to leeward of the landingplace its hard to say where we should get ashore besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs whereas the way we go the current must slacken and then we can dodge back along the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the currents less aready sir said the man gray who was sitting in the foresheets you can ease her off a bit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you my man said i quite as if nothing had happened for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly the captain spoke up again and i thought his voice was a little changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have thought of that said i for i made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could never get the gun ashore and if they did they could never haul it through the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look astern doctor replied the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had entirely forgotten the long nine and there to our horror were the five rogues busy about her getting off her jacket as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only that but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the roundshot and the powder for the gun had been left behind and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> israel was flints gunner said gray hoarsely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any risk we put the boats head direct for the landingplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing and i could keep her steady for the goal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the worst of it was that with the course i now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the hispaniola and offered a target like a barn door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could hear as well as see that brandyfaced rascal israel hands plumping down a roundshot on the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trelawney out and away said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trelawney will you please pick me off one of these men sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hands if possible said the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trelawney was as cool as steel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked to the priming of his gun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now cried the captain easy with that gun sir or youll swamp the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all hands stand by to trim her when he aims <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the squire raised his gun the rowing ceased and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had the gun by this time slewed round upon the swivel and hands who was at the muzzle with the rammer was in consequence the most exposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however we had no luck for just as trelawney fired down he stooped the ball whistled over him and it was one of the other four who fell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore and looking in that direction i saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here come the gigs sir said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give way then cried the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we mustnt mind if we swamp her now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we cant get ashore alls up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only one of the gigs is being manned sir i added the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll have a hot run sir returned the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not them i mind its the roundshot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell us squire when you see the match and well hold water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded and we had shipped but little water in the process <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were now close in thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gig was no longer to be feared the little point had already concealed it from our eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ebbtide which had so cruelly delayed us was now making reparation and delaying our assailants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the one source of danger was the gun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i durst said the captain id stop and pick off another man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade though he was not dead and i could see him trying to crawl away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the captain quick as an echo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he and redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the report fell in at the same instant of time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the first that jim heard the sound of the squires shot not having reached him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where the ball passed not one of us precisely knew but i fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate the boat sank by the stern quite gently in three feet of water leaving the captain and myself facing each other on our feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other three took complete headers and came up again drenched and bubbling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far there was no great harm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no lives were lost and we could wade ashore in safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there were all our stores at the bottom and to make things worse only two guns out of five remained in a state for service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mine i had snatched from my knees and held over my head by a sort of instinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the captain he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer and like a wise man lock uppermost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other three had gone down with the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to add to our concern we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our halfcrippled state but the fear before us whether if hunter and joyce were attacked by half a dozen they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hunter was steady that we knew joyce was a doubtful casea pleasant polite man for a valet and to brush ones clothes but not entirely fitted for a man of war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with all this in our minds we waded ashore as fast as we could leaving behind us the poor jollyboat and a good half of all our powder and provisions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> narrative continued by the doctor end of the we made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain said i trelawney is the dead shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give him your gun his own is useless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they exchanged guns and trelawney silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time observing gray to be unarmed i handed him my cutlass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand knit his brows and make the blade sing through the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side and almost at the same time seven mutineersjob anderson the boatswain at their headappeared in full cry at the southwestern corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they paused as if taken aback and before they recovered not only the squire and i but hunter and joyce from the block house had time to fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the four shots came in rather a scattering volley but they did the business one of the enemy actually fell and the rest without hesitation turned and plunged into the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after reloading we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was stone deadshot through the heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush a ball whistled close past my ear and poor tom redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both the squire and i returned the shot but as we had nothing to aim at it is probable we only wasted powder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain and gray were already examining him and i saw with half an eye that all was over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried groaning and bleeding into the loghouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor old fellow he had not uttered one word of surprise complaint fear or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now when we had laid him down in the loghouse to die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had lain like a trojan behind his mattress in the gallery he had followed every order silently doggedly and well he was the oldest of our party by a score of years and now sullen old serviceable servant it was he that was to die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand crying like a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom my man said i youre going home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i had had a lick at them with the gun first he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom said the squire say you forgive me wont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would that be respectful like from me to you squire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a little while of silence he said he thought somebody might read a prayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its the custom sir he added apologetically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and not long after without another word he passed away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime the captain whom i had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets had turned out a great many various storesthe british colours a bible a coil of stoutish rope pen ink the logbook and pounds of tobacco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had found a longish firtree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure and with the help of hunter he had set it up at the corner of the loghouse where the trunks crossed and made an angle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then climbing on the roof he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this seemed mightily to relieve him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reentered the loghouse and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had an eye on toms passage for all that and as soon as all was over came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you take on sir he said shaking the squires hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alls well with him no fear for a hand thats been shot down in his duty to captain and owner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it maynt be good divinity but its a fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> livesey he said in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him it was a question not of weeks but of months that if we were not back by the end of august blandly was to send to find us but neither sooner nor later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can calculate for yourself i said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why yes returned the captain scratching his head and making a large allowance sir for all the gifts of providence i should say we were pretty close hauled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a pity sir we lost that second load <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what i mean replied the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for powder and shot well do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the rations are short very short so short dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> livesey that were perhaps as well without that extra mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he pointed to the dead body under the flag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then with a roar and a whistle a roundshot passed high above the roof of the loghouse and plumped far beyond us in the wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve little enough powder already my lads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the second trial the aim was better and the ball descended inside the stockade scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain said the squire the house is quite invisible from the ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must be the flag they are aiming at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would it not be wiser to take it in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sir not i and as soon as he had said the words i think we all agreed with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it was not only a piece of stout seamanly good feeling it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all through the evening they kept thundering away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had no ricochet to fear and though one popped in through the roof of the loghouse and out again through the floor we soon got used to that sort of horseplay and minded it no more than cricket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is one good thing about all this observed the captain the wood in front of us is likely clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ebb has made a good while our stores should be uncovered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> volunteers to go and bring in pork <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gray and hunter were the first to come forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well armed they stole out of the stockade but it proved a useless mission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in israels gunnery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silver was in the sternsheets in command and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain sat down to his log and here is the alexander smollett master david livesey ships doctor abraham gray carpenters mate john trelawney owner john hunter and richard joyce owners servants landsmenbeing all that is left faithful of the ships companywith stores for ten days at short rations came ashore this day and flew british colours on the loghouse in treasure island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thomas redruth owners servant landsman shot by the and at the same time i was wondering over poor jim hawkins fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hail on the land side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somebody hailing us said hunter who was on guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i ran to the door in time to see jim hawkins safe and sound come climbing over the stockade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> narrative resumed by jim hawkins the garrison as soon as ben gunn saw the colours he came to a halt stopped me by the arm and sat down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said he theres your friends sure enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far more likely its the mutineers i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why in a place like this where nobody puts in but genlemen of fortune silver would fly the jolly roger you dont make no doubt of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres been blows too and i reckon your friends has had the best of it and here they are ashore in the old stockade as was made years and years ago by flint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah he was the man to have a headpiece was flint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barring rum his match were never seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he were afraid of none not he ony silversilver was that genteel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i that may be so and so be it all the more reason that i should hurry on and join my friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay mate returned ben not you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre a good boy or im mistook but youre ony a boy all told <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rum wouldnt bring me there where youre goingnot rum wouldnt till i see your born genleman and gets it on his word of honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you wont forget my words a precious sight thats what youll say a precious sight more confidence and then nips him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when ben gunn is wanted you know where to find him jim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just wheer you found him today <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand and hes to come alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youll say this ben gunn says you has reasons of his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i i believe i understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have something to propose and you wish to see the squire or the doctor and youre to be found where i found you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why from about noon observation to about six bells <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good said i and now may i go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> precious sight and reasons of his own says you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reasons of his own thats the mainstay as between man and man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well thenstill holding mei reckon you can go jim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and jim if you was to see silver you wouldnt go for to sell ben gunn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wild horses wouldnt draw it from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if them pirates camp ashore jim what would you say but thered be widders in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here he was interrupted by a loud report and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island and balls kept crashing through the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i moved from hidingplace to hidingplace always pursued or so it seemed to me by these terrifying missiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but towards the end of the bombardment though still i durst not venture in the direction of the stockade where the balls fell oftenest i had begun in a manner to pluck up my heart again and after a long detour to the east crept down among the shoreside trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun had just set the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage the tide too was far out and great tracts of sand lay uncovered the air after the heat of the day chilled me through my jacket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hispaniola still lay where she had anchored but sure enough there was the jolly rogerthe black flag of piracy flying from her peak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even as i looked there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering and one more roundshot whistled through the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the last of the cannonade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockadethe poor jollyboat i afterwards discovered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> away near the mouth of the river a great fire was glowing among the trees and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going the men whom i had seen so gloomy shouting at the oars like children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length i thought i might return towards the stockade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was pretty far down on the low sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east and is joined at halfwater to skeleton island and now as i rose to my feet i saw some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes an isolated rock pretty high and peculiarly white in colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which ben gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and i should know where to look for one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i skirted among the woods until i had regained the rear or shoreward side of the stockade and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had soon told my story and began to look about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the loghouse was made of unsquared trunks of pine roof walls and floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a porch at the door and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kindno other than a great ships kettle of iron with the bottom knocked out and sunk to her bearings as the captain said among the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little had been left besides the framework of the house but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very close around the stockadetoo close for defence they saidthe wood still flourished high and dense all of fir on the land side but towards the sea with a large admixture of liveoaks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cold evening breeze of which i have spoken whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was sand in our eyes sand in our teeth sand in our suppers sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle for all the world like porridge beginning to boil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our chimney was a square hole in the roof it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> add to this that gray the new man had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old tom redruth still unburied lay along the wall stiff and stark under the union jack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we had been allowed to sit idle we should all have fallen in the blues but captain smollett was never the man for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all hands were called up before him and he divided us into watches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor and gray and i for one the squire hunter and joyce upon the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tired though we all were two were sent out for firewood two more were set to dig a grave for redruth the doctor was named cook i was put sentry at the door and the captain himself went from one to another keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes which were almost smoked out of his head and whenever he did so he had a word for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that man smollett he said once is a better man than i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when i say that it means a deal jim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another time he came and was silent for a while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he put his head on one side and looked at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is this ben gunn a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know sir said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not very sure whether hes sane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if theres any doubt about the matter he is returned the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island jim cant expect to appear as sane as you or me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doesnt lie in human nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it cheese you said he had a fancy for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well jim says he just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve seen my snuffbox havent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you never saw me take snuff the reason being that in my snuffbox i carry a piece of parmesan cheesea cheese made in italy very nutritious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before supper was eaten we buried old tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bareheaded in the breeze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a good deal of firewood had been got in but not enough for the captains fancy and he shook his head over it and told us we must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appears they were at their wits end what to do the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but our best hope it was decided was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the hispaniola <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen two others were wounded and one at least the man shot beside the gunseverely wounded if he were not dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every time we had a crack at them we were to take it saving our own lives with the extremest care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and besides that we had two able alliesrum and the climate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the first though we were about half a mile away we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night and as for the second the doctor staked his wig that camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies the half of them would be on their backs before a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he added if we are not all shot down first theyll be glad to be packing in the schooner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its always a ship and they can get to buccaneering again i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first ship that ever i lost said captain smollett <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was dead tired as you may fancy and when i got to sleep which was not till after a great deal of tossing i slept like a log of wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when i was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard someone say and then immediately after with a cry of surprise silver himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at that up i jumped and rubbing my eyes ran to a loophole in the wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sure enough there were two men just outside the stockade one of them waving a white cloth the other no less a person than silver himself standing placidly by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was still quite early and the coldest morning that i think i ever was abroad ina chill that pierced into the marrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sky was bright and cloudless overhead and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but where silver stood with his lieutenant all was still in shadow and they waded kneedeep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was plainly a damp feverish unhealthy spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep indoors men said the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten to one this is a trick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain was in the porch keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot should any be intended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned and spoke to us doctors watch on the lookout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> livesey take the north side if you please jim the east gray west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the watch below all hands to load muskets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he turned again to the mutineers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what do you want with your flag of truce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time it was the other man who replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> capn silver sir to come on board and make terms he shouted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we could hear him adding to himself capn is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these poor lads have chosen me capn after your desertion sir laying a particular emphasis upon the word desertion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were willing to submit if we can come to terms and no bones about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all i ask is your word capn smollett to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade and one minute to get out o shot before a gun is fired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my man said captain smollett i have not the slightest desire to talk to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wish to talk to me you can come thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if theres any treachery itll be on your side and the lord help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats enough capn shouted long john cheerily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know a gentleman and you may lay to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold silver back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor was that wonderful seeing how cavalier had been the captains answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he advanced to the stockade threw over his crutch got a leg up and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will confess that i was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry indeed i had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain who had now seated himself on the threshold with his elbows on his knees his head in his hands and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was whistling come lasses and lads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what with the steepness of the incline the thick tree stumps and the soft sand he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he stuck to it like a man in silence and at last arrived before the captain whom he saluted in the handsomest style <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was tricked out in his best an immense blue coat thick with brass buttons hung as low as to his knees and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here you are my man said the captain raising his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you aint agoing to let me inside capn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a main cold morning to be sure sir to sit outside upon the sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why silver said the captain if you had pleased to be an honest man you might have been sitting in your galley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre either my ships cookand then you were treated handsomeor capn silver a common mutineer and pirate and then you can go hang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well well capn returned the seacook sitting down as he was bidden on the sand youll have to give me a hand up again thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sweet pretty place you have of it here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the top of the morning to you jim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why there you all are together like a happy family in a manner of speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you have anything to say my man better say it said the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right you were capn smollett replied silver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dooty is dooty to be sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well now you look here that was a good lay of yours last night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont deny it was a good lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of you pretty handy with a handspikeend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ill not deny neither but what some of my people was shookmaybe all was shook maybe i was shook myself maybe thats why im here for terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you mark me capn it wont do twice by thunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well have to do sentrygo and ease off a point or so on the rum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe you think we were all a sheet in the winds eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ill tell you i was sober i was ony dog tired and if id awoke a second sooner id a caught you at the act i would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wasnt dead when i got round to him not he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> says captain smollett as cool as can be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all that silver said was a riddle to him but you would never have guessed it from his tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for me i began to have an inkling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ben gunns last words came back to my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire and i reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well here it is said silver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we want that treasure and well have itthats our point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would just as soon save your lives i reckon and thats yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have a chart havent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats as may be replied the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well you have i know that returned long john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you neednt be so husky with a man there aint a particle of service in that and you may lay to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i mean is we want your chart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i never meant you no harm myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that wont do with me my man interrupted the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we know exactly what you meant to do and we dont care for now you see you cant do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if abe gray silver broke out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gray told me nothing and i asked him nothing and whats more i would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so theres my mind for you my man on that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this little whiff of temper seemed to cool silver down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been growing nettled before but now he pulled himself together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape or might not as the case were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and seein as how you are about to take a pipe capn ill make so free as do likewise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he filled a pipe and lighted it and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while now looking each other in the face now stopping their tobacco now leaning forward to spit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as good as the play to see them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now resumed silver here it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you give us the chart to get the treasure by and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do that and well offer you a choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either you come aboard along of us once the treasure shipped and then ill give you my affydavy upon my word of honour to clap you somewhere safe ashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or if that aint to your fancy some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing then you can stay here you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well divide stores with you man for man and ill give my affydavy as before to speak the first ship i sight and send em here to pick you up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> handsomer you couldnt look to get now you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i hoperaising his voice that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words for what is spoke to one is spoke to all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> refuse that and youve seen the last of me but musketballs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youll come up one by one unarmed ill engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wont my name is alexander smollett ive flown my sovereigns colours and ill see you all to davy jones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant sail the shiptheres not a man among you fit to sail the ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant fight us gray there got away from five of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your ships in irons master silver youre on a lee shore and so youll find <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stand here and tell you so and theyre the last good words youll get from me for in the name of heaven ill put a bullet in your back when next i meet you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bundle out of this please hand over hand and double quick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silvers face was a picture his eyes started in his head with wrath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook the fire out of his pipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wholl give me a hand up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a man among us moved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> growling the foulest imprecations he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he spat into the spring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what i think of ye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before an hours out ill stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before an hours out yell laugh upon the other side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> them that diell be the lucky ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with a dreadful oath he stumbled off ploughed down the sand was helped across the stockade after four or five failures by the man with the flag of truce and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as silver disappeared the captain who had been closely watching him turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but gray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the first time we had ever seen him angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then as we all slunk back to our places gray he said ill put your name in the log youve stood by your duty like a seaman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trelawney im surprised at you sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doctor i thought you had worn the kings coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if that was how you served at fontenoy sir youd have been better in your berth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctors watch were all back at their loopholes the rest were busy loading the spare muskets and everyone with a red face you may be certain and a flea in his ear as the saying is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain looked on for a while in silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lads said he ive given silver a broadside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pitched it in redhot on purpose and before the hours out as he said we shall be boarded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were outnumbered i neednt tell you that but we fight in shelter and a minute ago i should have said we fought with discipline <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive no manner of doubt that we can drub them if you choose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he went the rounds and saw as he said that all was clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the two short sides of the house east and west there were only two loopholes on the south side where the porch was two again and on the north side five <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a round score of muskets for the seven of us the firewood had been built into four pilestables you might sayone about the middle of each side and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle the cutlasses lay ranged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> toss out the fire said the captain the chill is past and we mustnt have smoke in our eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the iron firebasket was carried bodily out by mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trelawney and the embers smothered among sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hawkins help yourself and back to your post to eat it continued captain smollett <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lively now my lad youll want it before youve done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hunter serve out a round of brandy to all hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and while this was going on the captain completed in his own mind the plan of the defence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doctor you will take the door he resumed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see and dont expose yourself keep within and fire through the porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hunter take the east side there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joyce you stand by the west my man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trelawney you are the best shotyou and gray will take this long north side with the five loopholes its there the danger is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports things would begin to look dirty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hawkins neither you nor i are much account at the shooting well stand by to load and bear a hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the captain had said the chill was past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon the sane was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackets and coats were flung aside shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders and we stood there each at his post in a fever of heat and anxiety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is as dull as the doldrums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and just at that moment came the first news of the attack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you please sir said joyce if i see anyone am i to fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you sir returned joyce with the same quiet civility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing followed for a time but the remark had set us all on the alert straining ears and eyesthe musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so some seconds passed till suddenly joyce whipped up his musket and fired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley shot behind shot like a string of geese from every side of the enclosure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several bullets struck the loghouse but not one entered and as the smoke cleared away and vanished the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a bough waved not the gleam of a musket barrel betrayed the presence of our foes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next best thing to tell the truth muttered captain smollett <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how many should say there were on your side doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three shots were fired on this side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw the three flashestwo close togetherone farther to the west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how many on yours mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this was not so easily answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had come many from the northseven by the squires computation eight or nine according to gray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the east and west only a single shot had been fired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was plain therefore that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but captain smollett made no change in his arrangements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade he argued they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor had we much time left to us for thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly with a loud huzza a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same moment the fire was once more opened from the woods and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctors musket into bits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> squire and gray fired again and yet again three men fell one forwards into the enclosure two back on the outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of these one was evidently more frightened than hurt for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two had bit the dust one had fled four had made good their footing inside our defences while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men each evidently supplied with several muskets kept up a hot though useless fire on the loghouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the four who had boarded made straight before them for the building shouting as they ran and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several shots were fired but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the head of job anderson the boatswain appeared at the middle loophole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he roared in a voice of thunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same moment another pirate grasped hunters musket by the muzzle wrenched it from his hands plucked it through the loophole and with one stunning blow laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile a third running unharmed all around the house appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment since we were firing under cover at an exposed enemy now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the loghouse was full of smoke to which we owed our comparative safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cries and confusion the flashes and reports of pistolshots and one loud groan rang in my ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out lads out and fight em in the open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i snatched a cutlass from the pile and someone at the same time snatching another gave me a cut across the knuckles which i hardly felt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> someone was close behind i knew not whom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> right in front the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill and just as my eyes fell upon him beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the captain and even in the hurlyburly i perceived a change in his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mechanically i obeyed turned eastwards and with my cutlass raised ran round the corner of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next moment i was face to face with anderson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he roared aloud and his hanger went up above his head flashing in the sunlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not time to be afraid but as the blow still hung impending leaped in a trice upon one side and missing my foot in the soft sand rolled headlong down the slope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i had first sallied from the door the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one man in a red nightcap with his cutlass in his mouth had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well so short had been the interval that when i found my feet again all was in the same posture the fellow with the red nightcap still halfway over another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet in this breath of time the fight was over and the victory was ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gray following close behind me had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony the pistol still smoking in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a third as i had seen the doctor had disposed of at a blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the four who had scaled the palisade one only remained unaccounted for and he having left his cutlass on the field was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when i asked vahna she only laughed and clapped her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meantime my mountain sickness tuned up something fierce and i sat down on a big rock to wait for it to ease down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on now i said when i felt better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop your fooling and tell me where that nugget is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its nearer to you right now than ill ever get she answered her big eyes going sudden wistful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gold is the love of your i didnt say anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was no time to tell her about sarah here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but vahna seemed to shake off her depressed feelings and began to laugh and tease again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i jumped up as though it was a redhot stove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all it was was a rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> either she had gone clean loco or this was her idea of a joke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave me the hatchet and told me to take a hack at the boulder which i did again and again for yellow spots sprang up from under every blow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jones rose suddenly to his full height and flung out his long arms his face turned to the southern skies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the movement shot panic into the heart of a swan that had drawn nearer with amiably predatory designs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its consequent abrupt retreat collided it with a stout old lady who squealed and dropped her bag of peanuts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gold i tell you solid gold and that pure and soft that i chopped chips out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been coated with some sort of rainproof paint or lacquer made out of asphalt or something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder id taken it for a rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was ten feet long all of five feet through and tapering to both ends like an egg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from his pocket he drew and opened a leather case from which he took an object wrapped in tissuepaper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unwrapping it he dropped into my hand a chip of pure soft gold the size of a tendollar goldpiece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could make out the greyish substance on one side with which it had been painted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i chopped that from one end of the thing jones went on replacing the chip in its paper and leather case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and lucky i put it in my pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for right at my back came one loud word more like a croak than a word in my way of thinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there was that lean old fellow with the eagle beak that had dropped in on us one night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there was about thirty indians with him all slim young fellows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> vahnad flopped down and begun whimpering but i told her get up and make friends with them for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jones winced and her husband abruptly checked the particular flow of his narrative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then get up and fight along with me i said to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was some hellion there on the top of the world clawing and scratching tooth and nail a regular she cat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i wasnt idle though all i had was that hatchet and my long arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they were too many for me and there was no place for me to put my back against a wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i come to minutes after theyd cracked me on the head here feel this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> removing his hat julian jones guided my finger tips through his thatch of sandy hair until they sank into an indentation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was fully three inches long and went into the bone itself of the skull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i come to there was vahna spreadeagled on top of the nugget and the old fellow with a beak jabbering away solemnly as if going through some sort of religious exercises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his hand he had a stone knife you know a thin sharp sliver of some obsidianlike stuff same as they make arrowheads out of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt lift a hand being held down and being too weak besides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and well anyway that stone knife did for her and me they didnt even do the honour of killing there on top their sacred peak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they chucked me off of it like so much carrion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the buzzards didnt get me either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can see the moonlight yet shining on all those peaks of snow as i went down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why sir it was a fivehundredfoot fall only i didnt make it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went into a big snowdrift in a crevice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when i come to hours after i know for it was full day when i next saw the sun i found myself in a regular snowcave or tunnel caused by the water from the melting snow running along the ledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact the stone above actually overhung just beyond where i first landed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few feet more to the side either way and id almost be going yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a straight miracle thats what it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was two years and over before i knew what happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all i knew was that i was julian jones and that id been blacklisted in the big strike and that i was married to sarah here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know anything in between and when sarah tried to talk about it it gave me pains in the head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean my head was queer and i knew it was queer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then sitting on the porch of her fathers farmhouse back in nebraska one moonlight evening sarah came out and put that gold chip into my hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seems shed just found it in the torn lining of the trunk id brought back from ecuador i who for two years didnt even know id been to ecuador or australia or anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i just sat there looking at the chip in the moonlight and turning it over and over and figuring what it was and where itd come from when all of a sudden there was a snap inside my head as if something had broken and then i could see vahna spreadeagled on that big nugget and the old fellow with the beak waving the stone knife and  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is everything that had happened from the time i first left nebraska to when i crawled to the daylight out of the snow after they had chucked me off the mountaintop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but everything thatd happened after that id clean forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when sarah said i was her husband i wouldnt listen to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> took all her family and the preacher thatd married us to convince me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later on i wrote to seth manners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the railroad hadnt killed him yet and he pieced out a lot for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got them at the hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day he said making his regular run i crawled out on to the track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt stand upright i just crawled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took me for a calf or a big dog at first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wasnt anything human he said and i didnt know him or anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as near as i can make out it was ten days after the mountaintop to the time seth picked me up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i ate i dont know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it was doctors at quito and paloma nursing me she must have packed that gold chip in my trunk until they found out i was a man without a mind and the railroad sent me back to nebraska <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate thats what seth writes me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she corresponded with the railroad before they shipped me and all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jones nodded affirmation of his words sighed and evidenced unmistakable signs of eagerness to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint been able to work since her husband continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i aint been able to figure out how to get back that big nugget <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sarahs got money of her own and she wont let go a penny he wont get down to that country no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but sarah vahnas dead you know that julian jones protested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know anything about anything she answered decisively except that that country is no place for a married man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her lips snapped together and she fixed an unseeing stare across to where the afternoon sun was beginning to glow into sunset <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gazed for a moment at her face white plump tiny and implacable and gave her up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do you account for such a mass of gold being there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a solidgold meteor that fell out of the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was carried there by the indians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up a mountain like that and such enormous weight and size <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to be stumped by that proposition myself after i got my memory back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now how in sam hill i used to begin and then spend hours figuring at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then when i got the answer i felt downright idiotic it was that easy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused then announced they didnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you just said they did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did and they didnt was his enigmatic reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course they never carried that monster nugget up there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what they did was to carry up its contents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waited until he saw enlightenment dawn in my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then of course melted all the gold or welded it or smelted it all into one piece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know the first spaniards down there under a leader named pizarro were a gang of robbers and cut throats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went through the country like the hoofandmouth disease and killed the indians off like cattle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see the indians had lots of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well what the spaniards didnt get the surviving indians hid away in that one big chunk on top the mountain and its been waiting there ever since for me and for you if you want to go in on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here by the lagoon of the palace of fine arts ended my acquaintance with julian jones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on my agreeing to finance the adventure he promised to call on me at my hotel next morning with the letters of seth manners and the railroad and conclude arrangements <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that evening i telephoned his hotel and was informed by the clerk that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> julian jones and wife had departed in the early afternoon with their baggage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jones have rushed him back and hidden him away in nebraska <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember that as we said goodbye there was that in her smile that recalled the vulpine complacency of mona lisa the wise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was the summer of and there was trouble in the tarwater family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grandfather tarwater after remaining properly subdued and crushed for a quiet decade had broken out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time it was the klondike fever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his first and one unvarying symptom of such attacks was song <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one chant only he raised though he remembered no more than the first stanza and but three lines of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the family knew his feet were itching and his brain was tingling with the old madness when he lifted his hoarsecracked voice now like argus of the ancient times we leave this modern greece tumtum tumtum tum tum tumtum to shear the golden fleece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten years earlier he had lifted the chant sung to the air of the doxology when afflicted with the fever to go goldmining in patagonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the multitudinous family had sat upon him but had had a hard time doing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when all else had failed to shake his resolution they had applied lawyers to him with the threat of getting out guardianship papers and of confining him in the state asylum for the insane which was reasonable for a man who had a quarter of a century before speculated away all but ten meagre acres of a california principality and who had displayed no better business acumen ever since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the application of lawyers to john tarwater was like the application of a mustard plaster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for in his judgment they were the gentry more than any other who had skinned him out of the broad tarwater acres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so at the time of his patagonian fever the very thought of so drastic a remedy was sufficient to cure him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he quickly demonstrated he was not crazy by shaking the fever from him and agreeing not to go to patagonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next he demonstrated how crazy he really was by deeding over to his family unsolicited the ten acres on tarwater flat the house barn outbuildings and waterrights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also did he turn over the eight hundred dollars in bank that was the longsaved salvage of his wrecked fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for this the family found no cause for committal to the asylum since such committal would necessarily invalidate what he had done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grandfather is sure peeved said mary his oldest daughter herself a grandmother when her father quit smoking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all he had retained for himself was a span of old horses a mountain buckboard and his one room in the crowded house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> further having affirmed that he would be beholden to none of them he got the contract to carry the united states mail twice a week from kelterville up over tarwater mountain to old almaden which was a sporadically worked quicksilver mine in the upland cattle country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with his old horses it took all his time to make the two weekly round trips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for ten years rain or shine he had never missed a trip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor had he failed once to pay his weeks board into marys hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this board he had insisted on in the convalescence from his patagonian fever and he had paid it strictly though he had given up tobacco in order to be able to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he confided to the ruined water wheel of the old tarwater mill which he had built from the standing timber and which had ground wheat for the first settlers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll never put me in the poor farm so long as i support myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and without a penny to my name it aint likely any lawyer fellowsll come snoopin around after me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet precisely because of these highly rational acts it was held that john tarwater was mildly crazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first time he had lifted the chant of like argus of the ancient times had been in when twentytwo years of age violently attacked by the californian fever he had sold two hundred and forty michigan acres forty of it cleared for the price of four yoke of oxen and a wagon and had started across the plains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we turned off at fort hall where the oregon emigration went northard and swung south for californy was his way of concluding the narrative of that arduous journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and bill ping and me used to rope grizzlies out of the underbrush of cache slough in the sacramento valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> years of freighting and mining had followed and with a stake gleaned from the merced placers he satisfied the landhunger of his race and time by settling in sonoma county <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the ten years of carrying the mail across tarwater township up tarwater valley and over tarwater mountain most all of which land had once been his he had spent his time dreaming of winning back that land before he died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now his huge gaunt form more erect than it had been for years with a glinting of blue fires in his small and closeset eyes he was lifting his ancient chant again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he goes now listen to him said william tarwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody at home laughed harris topping day labourer husband of annie tarwater and father of her nine children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kitchen door opened to admit the old man returning from feeding his horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the song had ceased from his lips but mary was irritable from a burnt hand and a grandchild whose stomach refused to digest properly diluted cows milk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now there aint no use you carryin on that way father she tackled him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the times past for you to cut and run for a place like the klondike and singing wont buy you nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just the same he answered quietly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bet i could go to that klondike place and pick up enough gold to buy back the tarwater lands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you couldnt buy them back for lessn three hundred thousand and then some was williams effort at squelching him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i could pick up three hundred thousand and then some if i was only there the old man retorted placidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank god you cant walk there or youd be startin i know mary cried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to have money her father said humbly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you aint got any now so forget it william advised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> them times is past like roping bear with bill ping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just the same but mary cut him off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seizing the days paper from the kitchen table she flourished it savagely under her aged progenitors nose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there it is in cold print <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the young and robust can stand the klondike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its worse than the north pole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and theyve left their dead aplenty there themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre forty years older n the oldest of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john tarwater did look but his eyes strayed to other photographs on the highly sensational front page <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and look at the photys of them nuggets they brought down he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt i gopher twenty thousand outa the merced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and wouldnt it aben a hundred thousand if that cloudburst hadnt busted my wingdam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now if i was only in the klondike crazy as a loon william sneered in open aside to the rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a nice way to talk to your father old man tarwater censured mildly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my fatherd have walloped the tar out of me with a singletree if id spoke to him that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you are crazy father william began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thats where my father wasnt crazy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old mans been reading some of them magazine articles about men who succeeded after forty annie jibed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and why cant a man succeed after hes seventy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was only seventy this year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mebbe i could succeed if only i could get to the klondike which you aint going to get to mary shut him off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well then he sighed seeins i aint i might just as well go to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood up tall gaunt greatboned and gnarled a splendid ruin of a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his ragged hair and whiskers were not grey but snowy white as were the tufts of hair that stood out on the backs of his huge bony fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he moved toward the door opened it sighed and paused with a backward look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just the same he murmured plaintively the bottoms of my feet is itching something terrible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long before the family stirred next morning his horses fed and harnessed by lantern light breakfast cooked and eaten by lamp fight old man tarwater was off and away down tarwater valley on the road to kelterville <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two things were unusual about this usual trip which he had made a thousand and forty times since taking the mail contract <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not drive to kelterville but turned off on the main road south to santa rosa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even more remarkable than this was the paperwrapped parcel between his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it contained his one decent black suit which mary had been long reluctant to see him wear any more not because it was shabby but because as he guessed what was at the back of her mind it was decent enough to bury him in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at santa rosa in a secondhand clothes shop he sold the suit outright for two dollars and a half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the same obliging shopman he received four dollars for the wedding ring of his long dead wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the span of horses and the wagon he disposed of for seventyfive dollars although twentyfive was all he received down in cash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chancing to meet alton granger on the street to whom never before had he mentioned the ten dollars loaned him in he reminded alton granger of the little affair and was promptly paid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also of all unbelievable men to be in funds he so found the town drunkard for whom he had bought many a drink in the old and palmy days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from him john tarwater borrowed a dollar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he took the afternoon train to san francisco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dozen days later carrying a halfempty canvas sack of blankets and old clothes he landed on the beach of dyea in the thick of the great klondike rush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten thousand tons of outfit lay heaped and scattered and twice ten thousand men struggled with it and clamoured about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freight by indianback over chilcoot to lake linderman had jumped from sixteen to thirty cents a pound which latter was a rate of six hundred dollars a ton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the subarctic winter gloomed near at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all knew it and all knew that of the twenty thousand of them very few would get across the passes leaving the rest to winter and wait for the late spring thaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such the beach old john tarwater stepped upon and straight across the beach and up the trail toward chilcoot he headed cackling his ancient chant a very grandfather argus himself with no outfit worry in the world for he did not possess any outfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night he slept on the flats five miles above dyea at the head of canoe navigation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the dyea river became a rushing mountain torrent plunging out of a dark canyon from the glaciers that fed it far above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here early next morning he beheld a little man weighing no more than a hundred staggering along a footlog under all of a hundred pounds of flour strapped on his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he beheld the little man stumble off the log and fall facedownward in a quiet eddy where the water was two feet deep and proceed quietly to drown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was no desire of his to take death so easily but the flour on his back weighed as much as he and would not let him up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you old man he said to tarwater when the latter had dragged him up into the air and ashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he unlaced his shoes and ran the water out they had further talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next he fished out a tendollar goldpiece and offered it to his rescuer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old tarwater shook his head and shivered for the icewater had wet him to his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i reckon i wouldnt object to settin down to a friendly meal with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little man who was past forty and who had said his name was anson queried with a glance frankly curious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> expect to buy your grub on the inside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nary a dollar to buy it with friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> which aint so important as a warm bite of breakfast right now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ansons camp a quarter of a mile on tarwater found a slender redwhiskered young man of thirty cursing over a fire of wet willow wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> introduced as charles he transferred his scowl and wrath to tarwater who genially oblivious devoted himself to the fire took advantage of the chill morning breeze to create a draught which the other had left stupidly blocked by stones and soon developed less smoke and more flame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third member of the party bill wilson or big bill as they called him came in with a hundredandfortypound pack and what tarwater esteemed to be a very rotten breakfast was dished out by charles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mush was half cooked and mostly burnt the bacon was charred carbon and the coffee was unspeakable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately the meal was wolfed down the three partners took their empty packstraps and headed down trail to where the remainder of their outfit lay at the last camp a mile away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he washed the dishes foraged dry wood mended a broken packstrap put an edge on the butcherknife and campaxe and repacked the picks and shovels into a more carryable parcel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what had impressed him during the brief breakfast was the sort of awe in which anson and big bill stood of charles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once during the morning while anson took a breathing spell after bringing in another hundredpound pack tarwater delicately hinted his impression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see its this way anson said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we get to lake linderman and the trees are chopped and whipsawed into planks ill boss the building of the boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> big bill is a logger and miner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so hell boss getting out the logs and all mining operations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went broke paying the indians to pack that much of it to the top of chilcoot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our last partner is up there with it moving it along by himself down the other side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his names liverpool and hes a sailor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so when the boats built hes the boss of the outfit to navigate the lakes and rapids to klondike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> crayton what might his speciality be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it comes to business and organization hes boss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very lucky to get such a bunch of specialities into one outfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we met on the steamer coming up from san francisco and formed the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i got to be goin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charles is liable to get kicking because i aint packin my share just the same you cant expect a hundredpound man to pack as much as a hundredandsixtypounder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stick around and cook us something for dinner charles on his next load in and noting the effects of the old mans handiness told tarwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and tarwater cooked a dinner that was a dinner washed the dishes had real pork and beans for supper and bread baked in a fryingpan that was so delectable than the three partners nearly foundered themselves on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> supper dishes washed he cut shavings and kindling for a quick and certain breakfast fire showed anson a trick with footgear that was invaluable to any hiker sang his like argus of the ancient times and told them of the great emigration across the plains in fortynine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my goodness the first cheerful and heartylike camp since we hit the beach big bill remarked as he knocked out his pipe and began pulling off his shoes for bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kind of made things easy boys eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then i got a proposition boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can take it or leave it but just listen kindly to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre in a hurry to get in before the freezeup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half the time is wasted over the cooking by one of you that he might be puttin in packin outfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i do the cookin for you you allll get on that much faster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also the cookin ll be better and thatll make you pack better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i can pack quite a bit myself in between times quite a bit yes sir quite a bit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> big bill and anson were just beginning to nod their heads in agreement when charles stopped them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you expect of us in return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he demanded of the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i leave it up to the boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that aint business charles reprimanded sharply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its this way you expect us to feed you all winter eh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all i reckon is a passage to klondike in your boat would be mighty square of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent an ounce of grub old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll starve to death when you get there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been feedin some long time pretty successful old tarwater replied a whimsical light in his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im seventy and aint starved to death never yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you sign a paper to the effect that you shift for yourself as soon as you get to dawson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again charles checked his two partners expressions of satisfaction with the arrangement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were a party of four and we all have a vote on questions like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young liverpool is ahead with the main outfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got a say so and he isnt here to say it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what kind of a party might he be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a roughneck sailor and hes got a quick bad temper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the way he can cuss is simply godawful big bill testified <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but hes square big bill added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anson nodded heartily to this appraisal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well boys tarwater summed up i set out for californy and i got there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and im going to get to klondike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aint a thing can stop me aint a thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to get three hundred thousand outa the ground too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aint a thing can stop me aint a thing because i just naturally need the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mind a bad temper so longs the boy is square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill take my chance an ill work along with you till we catch up with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then if he says no to the proposition i reckon ill lose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but somehow i just cant see m sayin no because thatd mean too close up to freezeup and too late for me to find another chance like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as im sure going to get to klondike its just plumb impossible for him to say no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old john tarwater became a striking figure on a trail unusually replete with striking figures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with thousands of men each back tripping half a ton of outfit retracing every mile of the trail twenty times all came to know him and to hail him as father christmas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as he worked ever he raised his chant with his agefalsetto voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of the three men he had joined could complain about his work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> true his joints were stiff he admitted to a trifle of rheumatism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he moved slowly and seemed to creak and crackle when he moved but he kept on moving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last into the blankets at night he was first out in the morning so that the other three had hot coffee before their one beforebreakfast pack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and between breakfast and dinner and between dinner and supper he always managed to backtrip for several packs himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sixty pounds was the limit of his burden however <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could manage seventyfive but he could not keep it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once he tried ninety but collapsed on the trail and was seriously shaky for a couple of days afterward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a trail where hardworking men learned for the first time what work was no man worked harder in proportion to his strength than old tarwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> driven desperately on by the nearthrust of winter and lured madly on by the dream of gold they worked to their last ounce of strength and fell by the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> others when failure made certain blew out their brains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some went mad and still others under the irk of the mandestroying strain broke partnerships and dissolved lifetime friendships with fellows just as good as themselves and just as strained and mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old tarwater could shame them all despite his creaking and crackling and the nasty hacking cough he had developed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early and late on trail or in camp beside the trail he was ever in evidence ever busy at something ever responsive to the hail of father christmas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> weary backtrippers would rest their packs on a log or rock alongside of where he rested his and would say sing us that song of yourn dad about fortynine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he had wheezingly complied they would arise under their loads remark that it was real heartening and hit the forward trail again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever a man worked his passage and earned it big bill confided to his two partners that mans our old skeezicks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a valuable addition to the party and i for one aint at all disagreeable to the notion of making him a regular partner none of that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we get to dawson were quit of him thats the agreement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wed only have to bury him if we let him stay on with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides theres going to be a famine and every ounce of grubll count <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember were feeding him out of our own supply all the way in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if we run short in the pinch next year youll know the reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steamboats cant get up grub to dawson till the middle of june and thats nine months away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you put as much money and outfit in as the rest of us big bill conceded and youve a say according <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and im going to have my say charles asserted with increasing irritability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and its lucky for you with your fool sentiments that youve got somebody to think ahead for you else youd all starve to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you that famines coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flour will be two dollars a pound or ten and no sellers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across the rubblecovered flats up the dark canyon to sheep camp past the overhanging and everthreatening glaciers to the scales and from the scales up the steep pitches of icescoured rock where packers climbed with hands and feet old tarwater campcooked and packed and sang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he blew across chilcoot pass above timberline in the first swirl of autumn snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those below without firewood on the bitter rim of crater lake heard from the driving obscurity like argus of the ancient times we leave this modern greece tumtum tumtum tum tum tumtum to shear the golden fleece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and out of the snow flurries they saw appear a tall gaunt form with whiskers of flying white that blended with the storm bending under a sixtypound pack of camp dunnage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then three rousing cheers for father christmas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two miles beyond crater lake lay happy camp so named because here was found the uppermost fringe of the timber line where men might warm themselves by fire again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarcely could it be called timber for it was a dwarf rockspruce that never raised its loftiest branches higher than a foot above the moss and that twisted and grovelled like a pigvegetable under the moss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here on the trail leading into happy camp in the first sunshine of half a dozen days old tarwater rested his pack against a huge boulder and caught his breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around this boulder the trail passed laden men toiling slowly forward and men with empty packstraps limping rapidly back for fresh loads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice old tarwater essayed to rise and go on and each time warned by his shakiness sank back to recover more strength <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from around the boulder he heard voices in greeting recognized charles craytons voice and realized that at last they had met up with young liverpool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> quickly charles plunged into business and tarwater heard with great distinctness every word of charles unflattering description of him and the proposition to give him passage to dawson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dam fool proposition was liverpools judgment when charles had concluded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if hes on his last legs why in hell did you hook up with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if theres going to be a famine and it looks like it we need every ounce of grub for ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we only outfitted for four not five <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all right tarwater heard charles assuring the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old codger agreed to leave the final decision to you when we caught up with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all youve got to do is put your foot down and say no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean its up to me to turn the old one down after your encouraging him and taking advantage of his work clear from dyea here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a hard trail liverpool and only the men that are hard will get through charles strove to palliate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and im to do the dirty work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> liverpool complained while tarwaters heart sank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats just about the size of it charles said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then old tarwaters heart uprose again as the air was rent by a cyclone of profanity from the midst of which crackled sentences like dirty skunks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old codger goes down the yukon with us stack on that my hearty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know what hard is unless i show you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill bust the whole outfit to hell and gone if any of you try to side track him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just try to sidetrack him that is all and youll think the day of judgment and all gods blastingness has hit the camp in one chunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such was the invigoratingness of liverpools flow of speech that quite without consciousness of effort the old man arose easily under his load and strode on toward happy camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from happy camp to long lake from long lake to deep lake and from deep lake up over the enormous hogback and down to linderman the mankilling race against winter kept on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men broke their hearts and backs and wept beside the trail in sheer exhaustion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fall gales blew and amid bitter soaking rains and everincreasing snow flurries tarwater and the party to which he was attached piled the last of their outfit on the beach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across the lake a mile above a roaring torrent they located a patch of spruce and built their sawpit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here by hand with an inadequate whipsaw they sawed the spruce trunks into lumber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thrice on the nightshift underneath in the sawpit old tarwater fainted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by day he cooked as well and in the betweenwhiles helped anson in the building of the boat beside the torrent as the green planks came down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind shifted into the north and blew unending gales <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the mornings the weary men crawled from their blankets and in their socks thawed out their frozen shoes by the fire tarwater always had burning for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever arose the increasing tale of famine on the inside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last grub steamboats up from bering sea were stalled by low water at the beginning of the yukon flats hundreds of miles north of dawson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact they lay at the old hudson bay companys post at fort yukon inside the arctic circle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flour in dawson was up to two dollars a pound but no one would sell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bonanza and eldorado kings with money to burn were leaving for the outside because they could buy no grub <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miners committees were confiscating all grub and putting the population on strict rations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man who held out an ounce of grub was shot like a dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a score had been so executed already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and under a strain which had broken so many younger men old tarwater began to break <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his cough had become terrible and had not his exhausted comrades slept like the dead he would have kept them awake nights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he began to take chills so that he dressed up to go to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had finished so dressing not a rag of garment remained in his clothes bag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all he possessed was on his back and swathed around his gaunt old form <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he puts all hes got on now when it aint lower than twenty above whatll he do later on when it goes down to fifty and sixty below <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they lined the roughmade boat down the mountain torrent nearly losing it a dozen times and rowed across the south end of lake linderman in the thick of a fall blizzard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next morning they planned to load and start squarely into the teeth of the north on their perilous traverse of half a thousand miles of lakes and rapids and box canyons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before he went to bed that night young liverpool was out over the camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he returned to find his whole party asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rousing tarwater he talked with him in low tones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve got a passage in our boat and if ever a man earned a passage you have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you know yourself youre pretty well along in years and your health right now aint exciting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you go on with us youll croak surern hell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now wait till i finish dad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the price for a passage has jumped to five hundred dollars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been throwing my feet and ive hustled a passenger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes an official of the alaska commercial and just has to get in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes bid up to six hundred to go with me in our boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you sell it to him poke the six hundred into your jeans and pull south for california while the goins good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can be in dyea in two days and in california in a week more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tarwater coughed and shivered for a space ere he could get freedom of breath for speech <end> <end> 
<start> <start> son he said i just want to tell you one thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i drove my four yoke of oxen across the plains in fortynine and lost nary a one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i drove them plumb to californy and i freighted with them afterward out of sutters fort to american bar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aint nothing can stop me aint nothing at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im going to ride that boat with you at the steering sweep clean to klondike and im going to shake three hundred thousand out of the mossroots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that being so its contrary to reason and common sense for me to sell out my passage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i thank you kindly son i thank you kindly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young sailor shot out his hand impulsively and gripped the old mans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood up wandered away and leaned an instant in the darkening windowframe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from there she turned to fling back at him dont imagine im the least bit sorry for anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he steadied his elbows on the table and hid his face in his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was harder oh damnably harder than he had expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arguments expedients palliations evasions all seemed to be slipping away from him he was left face to face with the mere graceless fact of his inferiority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lifted his head to ask at random youve been here then ever since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it turned out that the farlows were hunting for meall the whilefor this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood facing him her back to the window evidently impatient to be gone yet with something still to say or that she expected to hear him say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sense of her expectancy benumbed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what in heavens name could he say to her that was not an offense or a mockery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your idea of the theatreyou gave that up at once then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt wait for the theatre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to take the first thing that offered i took this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pushed on haltingly im gladextremely gladyoure happy here...id counted on your letting me know if there was anything i could do...the theatre nowif you still regret itif youre not contented here...i know people in that line in londonim certain i can manage it for you when i get back she moved up to the table and leaned over it to ask in a voice that was hardly above a whisper then you do want me to leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dropped his arms with a groan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can you think such things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the time you know i begged you to let me do what i could but you wouldnt hear of it...and ever since ive been wanting to be of useto do something anything to help you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she heard him through motionless without a quiver of the clasped hands she rested on the edge of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you want to help me thenyou can help me to stay here she brought out with lowtoned intensity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the stillness of the pause which followed the bray of a motorhorn sounded far down the drive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly she turned with a last white look at him and fled from the room and up the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood motionless benumbed by the shock of her last words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was afraid thenafraid of himsick with fear of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the discovery beat him down to a lower depth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the motorhorn sounded again close at hand and he turned and went up to his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his letterwriting was a sufficient pretext for not immediately joining the party about the teatable and he wanted to be alone and try to put a little order into his tumultuous thinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upstairs the room held out the intimate welcome of its lamp and fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything in it exhaled the same sense of peace and stability which two evenings before had lulled him to complacent meditation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his armchair again invited him from the hearth but he was too agitated to sit still and with sunk head and hands clasped behind his back he began to wander up and down the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his five minutes with sophy viner had flashed strange lights into the shadowy corners of his consciousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls absolute candour her hard ardent honesty was for the moment the vividest point in his thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered anew as he had wondered before at the way in which the harsh discipline of life had stripped her of false sentiment without laying the least touch on her pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they had parted five months before she had quietly but decidedly rejected all his offers of help even to the suggestion of his trying to further her theatrical aims she had made it clear that she wished their brief alliance to leave no trace on their lives save that of its own smiling memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now that they were unexpectedly confronted in a situation which seemed to her terrified fancy to put her at his mercy her first impulse was to defend her right to the place she had won and to learn as quickly as possible if he meant to dispute it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he had pictured her as shrinking away from him in a tremor of selfeffacement she had watched his movements made sure of her opportunity and come straight down to have it out with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was so struck by the frankness and energy of the proceeding that for a moment he lost sight of the view of his own character implied in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could only go on saying and with the repetition of the words the picture of himself as she must see him pitiably took shape again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he understood then for the first time how vague in comparison with hers had been his own vision of the part he had played in the brief episode of their relation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the incident had left in him a sense of exasperation and self contempt but that as he now perceived was chiefly if not altogether as it bore on his preconceived ideal of his attitude toward another woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had fallen below his own standard of sentimental loyalty and if he thought of sophy viner it was mainly as the chance instrument of his lapse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these considerations were not agreeable to his pride but they were forced on him by the example of her valiant commonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had cut a sorry figure in the business he owed it to her not to close his eyes to the fact any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when he opened them what did he see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the situation detestable at best would yet have been relatively simple if protecting sophy viner had been the only duty involved in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact that that duty was paramount did not do away with the contingent obligations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was darrows instinct in difficult moments to go straight to the bottom of the difficulty but he had never before had to take so dark a dive as this and for the minute he shivered on the brink...well his first duty at any rate was to the girl he must let her see that he meant to fulfill it to the last jot and then try to find out how to square the fulfillment with the other problems already in his path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the oak room he found mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the group as he came toward it down the long drawingrooms composed itself prettily about the teatable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lamps and the fire crossed their gleams on silver and porcelain on the bright haze of effies hair and on the whiteness of annas forehead as she leaned back in her chair behind the teaurn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not move at darrows approach but lifted to him a deep gaze of peace and confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the look seemed to throw about him the spell of a divine security he felt the joy of a convalescent suddenly waking to find the sunlight on his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de chantelle across her knitting discoursed of their afternoons excursion with occasional pauses induced by the hypnotic effect of the fresh air and effie kneeling on the hearth softly but insistently sought to implant in her terriers mind some notion of the relation between a vertical attitude and sugar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow took a chair behind the little girl so that he might look across at her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was almost a necessity for him at the moment to let his eyes rest on annas face and to meet now and then the proud shyness of her gaze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de chantelle presently enquired what had become of owen and a moment later the window behind her opened and her grandson gun in hand came in from the terrace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he stood there in the lamplight with dead leaves and bits of bramble clinging to his mudspattered clothes the scent of the night about him and its chill on his pale bright face he really had the look of a young faun strayed in from the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie abandoned the terrier to fly to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh owen where in the world have you been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i walked miles and miles with nurse and couldnt find you and we met jean and he said he didnt know where youd gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody knows where i go or what i see when i get there thats the beauty of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if youre good he added ill tell you about it one of these days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont really believe ill ever be much better than i am now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let owen have his tea first her mother suggested but the young man declining the offer propped his gun against the wall and lighting a cigarette began to pace up and down the room in a way that reminded darrow of his own caged wanderings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie pursued him with her blandishments and for a while he poured out to her a lowvoiced stream of nonsense then he sat down beside his stepmother and leaned over to help himself to tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked as effie climbed up on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why isnt she here to chain up this ungovernable infant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor miss viner has a headache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie says she went to her room as soon as lessons were over and sent word that she wouldnt be down for tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah said owen abruptly setting down his cup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood up lit another cigarette and wandered away to the piano in the room beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the twilight where he sat a lonely music borne on fantastic chords floated to the group about the teatable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under its influence madame de chantelles meditative pauses increased in length and frequency and effie stretched herself on the hearth her drowsy head against the dog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently her nurse appeared and anna rose at the same time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop a minute in my sittingroom on your way up she paused to say to darrow as she went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few hours earlier her request would have brought him instantly to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had given him on the day of his arrival an inviting glimpse of the spacious booklined room above stairs in which she had gathered together all the tokens of her personal tastes the retreat in which as one might fancy anna leath had hidden the restless ghost of anna summers and the thought of a talk with her there had been in his mind ever since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now he sat motionless as if spellbound by the play of madame de chantelles needles and the pulsations of owens fitful music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she will want to ask me about the girl he repeated to himself with a fresh sense of the insidious taint that embittered all his thoughts the hand of the slender columned clock on the mantelpiece had spanned a halfhour before shame at his own indecision finally drew him to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from her writingtable where she sat over a pile of letters anna lifted her happy smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the impulse to press his lips to it made him come close and draw her upward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she threw her head back as if surprised at the abruptness of the gesture then her face leaned to his with the slow droop of a flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt again the sweep of the secret tides and all his fears went down in them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat down in the sofacorner by the fire and he drew an armchair close to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his gaze roamed peacefully about the quiet room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its just like youit is you he said as his eyes came back to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a good place to be alone ini dont think ive ever before cared to talk with any one here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets be quiet then its the best way of talking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but we must save it up till later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are things i want to say to you now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaned back in his chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say them then and ill listen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to tell me about miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he summoned up a look of faint interrogation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought she seemed surprised at his surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its important naturally she explained that i should find out all i can about her before i leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course...but youve every reason to be satisfied havent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effies very fond of her and she seems to have a delightful influence on the child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we know so little after allabout her antecedents i mean and her past history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why i want you to try and recall everything you heard about her when you used to see her in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh on that score im afraid i shant be of much use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i told you she was a mere shadow in the background of the house i saw her inand that was four or five years ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she was with a mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes an appalling woman who runs a roaring dinnerfactory that used now and then to catch me in its wheels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i escaped from them long ago but in my time there used to be half a dozen fagged hands to tend the machine and miss viner was one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im glad shes out of it poor girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you never really saw anything of her there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> murrett discouraged any competition on the part of her subordinates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> especially such pretty ones i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow made no comment and she continued and mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> murretts own opinion if shed offered you oneprobably wouldnt have been of much value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only in so far as her disapproval would on general principles have been a good mark for miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but surely he went on after a pause you could have found out about her from the people through whom you first heard of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh we heard of her through adelaide painter and in reply to his glance of interrogation she explained that the lady in question was a spinster of south braintree massachusetts who having come to paris some thirty years earlier to nurse a brother through an illness had ever since protestingly and provisionally camped there in a state of contemptuous protestation oddly manifested by her never taking the slipcovers off her drawingroom chairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her long residence on gallic soil had not mitigated her hostility toward the creed and customs of the race but though she always referred to the catholic church as the scarlet woman and took the darkest views of french private life madame de chantelle placed great reliance on her judgment and experience and in every domestic crisis the irreducible adelaide was immediately summoned to givre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its all the odder because my motherinlaw since her second marriage has lived so much in the country that shes practically lost sight of all her other american friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides which you can see how completely she has identified herself with monsieur de chantelles nationality and adopted french habits and prejudices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet when anything goes wrong she always sends for adelaide painter whos more american than the stars and stripes and might have left south braintree yesterday if she hadnt rather brought it over with her in her trunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then if south braintree vouches for miss viner oh but only indirectly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we had that odious adventure with mademoiselle grumeau whod been so highly recommended by monsieur de chantelles aunt the chanoinesse adelaide was of course sent for and she said at once im not the least bit surprised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive always told you that what you wanted for effie was a sweet american girl and not one of these nasty foreigners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unluckily she couldnt at the moment put her hand on a sweet american but she presently heard of miss viner through the farlows an excellent couple who live in the quartier latin and write about french life for the american papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was only too thankful to find anyone who was vouched for by decent people and so far ive had no cause to regret my choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i know after all very little about miss viner and there are all kinds of reasons why i want as soon as possible to find out more to find out all i can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since youve got to leave effie i understand your feeling in that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but is there in such a case any recommendation worth half as much as your own direct experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no and its been so favourable that i was ready to accept it as conclusive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only naturally when i found youd known her in london i was in hopes youd give me some more specific reasons for liking her as much as i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid i can give you nothing more specific than my general vague impression that she seems very plucky and extremely nice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont at any rate know anything specific to the contrary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not conscious of ever having heard any one say two words about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only infer that she must have pluck and character to have stuck it out so long at mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has pluck certainly and pride too which must have made it all the harder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont know how glad i am that your impressions on the whole so good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i particularly wanted you to like her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew her to him with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on that condition im prepared to love even adelaide painter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i almost hope you wont have the chance topoor adelaide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her appearance here always coincides with a catastrophe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh then i must manage to meet her elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held anna closer saying to himself as he smoothed back the hair from her forehead what does anything matter but just this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she answered absently it must be time to dress then she drew back a little and laid her hands on his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it came to him that they were the first words of endearment he had heard her speak and their rareness gave them a magic quality of reassurance as though no danger could strike through such a shield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a knock on the door made them draw apart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anna lifted her hand to her hair and darrow stooped to examine a photograph of effie on the writingtable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door opened and sophy viner entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do come in miss viner anna repeated looking at her kindly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl a quick red in her cheeks still hesitated on the threshold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im so sorry but effie has mislaid her latin grammar and i thought she might have left it here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i need it to prepare for tomorrows lesson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow asked picking up a book from the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held it out to her and she took it and moved to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait a minute please miss viner anna said and as the girl turned back she went on with her quiet smile effie told us youd gone to your room with a headache <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mustnt sit up over tomorrows lessons if you dont feel well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you see i have to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> latins one of my weak points and theres generally only one page of this book between me and effie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she threw the words off with a halfironic smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do excuse my disturbing you she added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you didnt disturb me anna answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow perceived that she was looking intently at the girl as though struck by something tense and tremulous in her face her voice her whole mien and attitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd much better go straight to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie wont be sorry to skip her latin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank youbut im really all right murmured sophy viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her glance making a swift circuit of the room dwelt for an appreciable instant on the intimate propinquity of armchair and sofacorner then she turned back to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at dinner that evening madame de chantelles slender monologue was thrown out over gulfs of silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> owen was still in the same state of moody abstraction as when darrow had left him at the piano and even annas face to her friends vigilant eye revealed not perhaps a personal preoccupation but a vague sense of impending disturbance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she smiled she bore a part in the talk her eyes dwelt on darrows with their usual deep reliance but beneath the surface of her serenity his tense perceptions detected a hidden stir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sufficiently selfpossessed to tell himself that it was doubtless due to causes with which he was not directly concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew the question of owens marriage was soon to be raised and the abrupt alteration in the young mans mood made it seem probable that he was himself the centre of the atmospheric disturbance for a moment it occurred to darrow that anna might have employed her afternoon in preparing madame de chantelle for her grandsons impending announcement but a glance at the elder ladys unclouded brow showed that he must seek elsewhere the clue to owens taciturnity and his stepmothers concern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> possibly anna had found reason to change her own attitude in the matter and had made the change known to owen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this again was negatived by the fact that during the afternoons shooting young leath had been in a mood of almost extravagant expansiveness and that from the moment of his late return to the house till just before dinner there had been to darrows certain knowledge no possibility of a private talk between himself and his stepmother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this obscured if it narrowed the field of conjecture and darrows gropings threw him back on the conclusion that he was probably reading too much significance into the moods of a lad he hardly knew and who had been described to him as subject to sudden changes of humour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to annas fancied perturbation it might simply be due to the fact that she had decided to plead owens cause the next day and had perhaps already had a glimpse of the difficulties awaiting her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but darrow knew that he was too deep in his own perplexities to judge the mental state of those about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might be after all that the variations he felt in the currents of communication were caused by his own inward tremor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such at any rate was the conclusion he had reached when shortly after the two ladies left the drawingroom he bade owen goodnight and went up to his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever since the rapid selfcolloquy which had followed on his first sight of sophy viner he had known there were other questions to be faced behind the one immediately confronting him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the score of that one at least his mind if not easy was relieved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had done what was possible to reassure the girl and she had apparently recognized the sincerity of his intention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had patched up as decent a conclusion as he could to an incident that should obviously have had no sequel but he had known all along that with the securing of miss viners peace of mind only a part of his obligation was discharged and that with that part his remaining duty was in conflict <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been his first business to convince the girl that their secret was safe with him but it was far from easy to square this with the equally urgent obligation of safeguarding annas responsibility toward her child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow was not much afraid of accidental disclosures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both he and sophy viner had too much at stake not to be on their guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fear that beset him was of another kind and had a profounder source <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted to do all he could for the girl but the fact of having had to urge anna to confide effie to her was peculiarly repugnant to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his own ideas about sophy viner were too mixed and indeterminate for him not to feel the risk of such an experiment yet he found himself in the intolerable position of appearing to press it on the woman he desired above all others to protect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> till late in the night his thoughts revolved in a turmoil of indecision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his pride was humbled by the discrepancy between what sophy viner had been to him and what he had thought of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this discrepancy which at the time had seemed to simplify the incident now turned out to be its most galling complication <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bare truth indeed was that he had hardly thought of her at all either at the time or since and that he was ashamed to base his judgement of her on his meagre memory of their adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the essential cheapness of the whole affairas far as his share in it was concernedcame home to him with humiliating distinctness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would have liked to be able to feel that at the time at least he had staked something more on it and had somehow in the sequel had a more palpable loss to show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the plain fact was that he hadnt spent a penny on it which was no doubt the reason of the prodigious score it had since been rolling up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate beat about the case as he would it was clear that he owed it to annaand incidentally to his own peace of mindto find some way of securing sophy viners future without leaving her installed at givre when he and his wife should depart for their new post <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night brought no aid to the solving of this problem but it gave him at any rate the clear conviction that no time was to be lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his first step must be to obtain from miss viner the chance of another and calmer talk and he resolved to seek it at the earliest hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had gathered that effies lessons were preceded by an early scamper in the park and conjecturing that her governess might be with her he betook himself the next morning to the terrace whence he wandered on to the gardens and the walks beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the atmosphere was still and pale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the muffled sunlight gleamed like gold tissue through grey gauze and the beech alleys tapered away to a blue haze blent of sky and forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was one of those elusive days when the familiar forms of things seem about to dissolve in a prismatic shimmer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stillness was presently broken by joyful barks and darrow tracking the sound overtook effie flying down one of the long alleys at the head of her pack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond her he saw miss viner seated near the stonerimmed basin beside which he and anna had paused on their first walk to the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl coming forward at his approach returned his greeting almost gaily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his first glance showed him that she had regained her composure and the change in her appearance gave him the measure of her fears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time he saw in her again the sidelong grace that had charmed his eyes in paris but he saw it now as in a painted picture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shall we sit down a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked as effie trotted off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl looked away from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid theres not much time we must be back at lessons at halfpast nine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its barely ten minutes past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets at least walk a little way toward the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she glanced down the long walk ahead of them and then back in the direction of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you like she said in a low voice with one of her quick fluctuations of colour but instead of taking the way he proposed she turned toward a narrow path which branched off obliquely through the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow was struck and vaguely troubled by the change in her look and tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was in them an undefinable appeal whether for help or forbearance he could not tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it occurred to him that there might have been something misleading in his so pointedly seeking her and he felt a momentary constraint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to ease it he made an abrupt dash at the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came out to look for you because our talk of yesterday was so unsatisfactory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to hear more about youabout your plans and prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been wondering ever since why youve so completely given up the theatre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her face instantly sharpened to distrust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to live she said in an offhand tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i understand perfectly that you should like it herefor a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his glance strayed down the goldroofed windings ahead of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its delightful you couldnt be better placed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only i wonder a little at your having so completely given up any idea of a different future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she waited for a moment before answering i suppose im less restless than i used to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its certainly natural that you should be less restless here than at mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> murretts yet somehow i dont seem to see you permanently given up to forming the young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatexactlydo you seem to see me permanently given up to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know you warned me rather emphatically against the theatre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she threw off the statement without impatience as though they were discussing together the fate of a third person in whom both were benevolently interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i did it was because you so emphatically refused to let me help you to a start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stopped short and faced him and you think i may let you now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow felt the blood in his cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not understand her attitudeif indeed she had consciously taken one and her changes of tone did not merely reflect the involuntary alternations of her mood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it humbled him to perceive once more how little he had to guide him in his judgment of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said to himself if id ever cared a straw for her i should know how to avoid hurting her nowand his insensibility struck him as no better than a vulgar obtuseness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had a fixed purpose ahead and could only push on to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope at any rate youll listen to my reasons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres been time on both sides to think them over since he caught himself back and hung helpless on the since whatever words he chose he seemed to stumble among reminders of their past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she walked on beside him her eyes on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then im to understanddefinitelythat you do renew your with all my heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if youll only let me she raised a hand as though to check him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its extremely friendly of youi do believe you mean it as a friend but i dont quite understand why finding me as you say so well placed here you should show more anxiety about my future than at a time when i was actually and rather desperately adrift <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you show any at all it must at any rate be for different reasons.in fact it can only be she went on with one of her disconcerting flashes of astuteness for one of two reasons either because you feel you ought to help me or because for some reason you think you owe it to mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leath to let her know what you know of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow stood still in the path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind him he heard effies call and at the childs voice he saw sophy turn her head with the alertness of one who is obscurely on the watch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the look was so fugitive that he could not have said wherein it differed from her normal professional air of having her pupil on her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie sprang past them and darrow took up the girls challenge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to my reasons for wanting to help you a good deal depends on the words one uses to define rather indefinite things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its true enough that i want to help you but the wish isnt due to...to any past kindness on your part but simply to my own interest in you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not put it that our friendship gives me the right to intervene for what i believe to be your benefit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took a few hesitating steps and then paused again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow noticed that she had grown pale and that there were rings of shade about her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he paused with a sense of approaching peril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me you were friendsgreat friends yes he admitted were great friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you might naturally feel yourself justified in telling her that you dont think im the right person for effie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he uttered a sound of protest but she disregarded it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont say youd like to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the natural alternative would be to try to persuade me that id be better off somewhere else than here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but supposing that failed and you saw i was determined to stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you might think it your duty to tell mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laid the case before him with a cold lucidity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should in your place i believe she ended with a little laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt feel justified in telling her behind your back if i thought you unsuited for the place but i should certainly feel justified he rejoined after a pause in telling you if i thought the place unsuited to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thats what youre trying to tell me now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but not for the reasons you imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what then are your reasons if you please <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive already implied them in advising you not to give up all idea of the theatre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre too various too gifted too personal to tie yourself down at your age to the dismal drudgery of teaching <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and is that what youve told mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she rushed the question out at him as if she expected to trip him up over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was moved by the simplicity of the stratagem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive told her exactly nothing he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and whatexactlydo you mean by nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you and she were talking about me when i came into her sittingroom yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow felt his blood rise at the thrust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive told her simply that id seen you once or twice at mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and not that youve ever seen me since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and not that ive ever seen you since <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she believes youshe completely believes you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he uttered a protesting exclamation and his flush reflected itself in the girls cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt mean to ask you that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she halted and again cast a rapid glance behind and ahead of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she held out her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then thank you and let me relieve your fears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shant be effies governess much longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the announcement darrow tried to merge his look of relief into the expression of friendly interest with which he grasped her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you really do agree with me then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youll give me a chance to talk things over with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shook her head with a faint smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not thinking of the stage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive had another offer thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the relief was hardly less great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all his personal responsibility ceased with her departure from givre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll tell me about that thenwont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh youll hear about it soon...i must catch effie now and drag her back to the blackboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she walked on for a few yards and then paused again and confronted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been odious to youand not quite honest she broke out suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he repeated caught in a fresh wave of wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean in seeming not to trust you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its come over me again as we talked that at heart ive always known i could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her colour rose in a bright wave and her eyes clung to his for a swift instant of reminder and appeal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the same space of time the past surged up in him confusedly then a veil dropped between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned and saw the little girl trotting back to them her hand in owen leaths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even through the stir of his subsiding excitement darrow was at once aware of the change effected by the young mans approach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment sophy viners cheeks burned redder then they faded to the paleness of white petals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she lost however nothing of the bright bravery which it was her way to turn on the unexpected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps no one less familiar with her face than darrow would have discerned the tension of the smile she transferred from himself to owen leath or have remarked that her eyes had hardened from misty grey to a shining darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but her observer was less struck by this than by the corresponding change in owen leath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter when he came in sight had been laughing and talking unconcernedly with effie but as his eye fell on miss viner his expression altered as suddenly as hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the change for darrow was less definable but perhaps for that reason it struck him as more sharply significant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> owen like sophy viner had the kind of face which seems less the stage on which emotions move than the very stuff they work in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in moments of excitement his odd irregular features seemed to grow fluid to unmake and remake themselves like the shadows of clouds on a stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow through the rapid flight of the shadows could not seize on any specific indication of feeling he merely perceived that the young man was unaccountably surprised at finding him with miss viner and that the extent of his surprise might cover all manner of implications <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrows first idea was that owen if he suspected that the conversation was not the result of an accidental encounter might wonder at his stepmothers suitor being engaged at such an hour in private talk with her little girls governess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought was so disturbing that as the three turned back to the house he was on the point of saying to owen i came out to look for your mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the contingency he feared even so simple a phrase might seem like an awkward attempt at explanation and he walked on in silence at miss viners side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently he was struck by the fact that owen leath and the girl were silent also and this gave a new turn to his thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> silence may be as variously shaded as speech and that which enfolded darrow and his two companions seemed to his watchful perceptions to be quivering with crossthreads of communication <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first he was aware only of those that centred in his own troubled consciousness then it occurred to him that an equal activity of intercourse was going on outside of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something was in fact passing mutely and rapidly between young leath and sophy viner but what it was and whither it tended darrow when they reached the house was but just beginning to divine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anna leath from the terrace watched the return of the little group <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked down on them as they advanced across the garden from the serene height of her unassailable happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they were coming toward her in the mild morning light her child her stepson her promised husband the three beings who filled her life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she smiled a little at the happy picture they presented effies gambols encircling it in a moving frame within which the two men came slowly forward in the silence of friendly understanding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed part of the deep intimacy of the scene that they should not be talking to each other and it did not till afterward strike her as odd that neither of them apparently felt it necessary to address a word to sophy viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anna herself at the moment was floating in the midcurrent of felicity on a tide so bright and buoyant that she seemed to be one with its warm waves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first rush of bliss had stunned and dazzled her but now that each morning she woke to the calm certainty of its recurrence she was growing used to the sense of security it gave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel as if i could trust my happiness to carry me as if it had grown out of me like wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she phrased it to darrow as later in the morning they paced the garden paths together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his answering look gave her the same assurance of safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the evening before he had seemed preoccupied and the shadow of his mood had faintly encroached on the great golden orb of their blessedness but now it was uneclipsed again and hung above them high and bright as the sun at noon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upstairs in her sittingroom that afternoon she was thinking of these things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning mists had turned to rain compelling the postponement of an excursion in which the whole party were to have joined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie with her governess had been despatched in the motor to do some shopping at francheuil and anna had promised darrow to join him later in the afternoon for a quick walk in the rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had gone to his room after luncheon to get some belated letters off his conscience and when he had left her she had continued to sit in the same place her hands crossed on her knees her head slightly bent in an attitude of brooding retrospection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she looked back at her past life it seemed to her to have consisted of one ceaseless effort to pack into each hour enough to fill out its slack folds but now each moment was like a misers bag stretched to bursting with pure gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was roused by the sound of owens step in the gallery outside her room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it paused at her door and in answer to his knock she called out come in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the door closed behind him she was struck by his look of pale excitement and an impulse of compunction made her say youve come to ask me why i havent spoken to your grandmother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sent about him a glance vaguely reminding her of the strange look with which sophy viner had swept the room the night before then his brilliant eyes came back to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive spoken to her myself he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i left her to come here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annas first feeling was one of annoyance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was really something comically incongruous in this boyish surrender to impulse on the part of a young man so eager to assume the responsibilities of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with a faintly veiled amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you asked me to help you and i promised you i would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was hardly worth while to work out such an elaborate plan of action if you intended to take the matter out of my hands without telling me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh dont take that tone with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stared at his quivering face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might she pursued still halflaughing more properly make that request of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> owen reddened and his vehemence suddenly subsided <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meant that i had to speakthats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont give me a chance to explain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him gently wondering a little at her own impatience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont i always want to give you every chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its because i do that i wanted to talk to your grandmother firstthat i was waiting and watching for the right moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his voice rose again and took the sharp edge it had in moments of high pressure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his stepmother turned away and seated herself in her sofa corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh my dear its not a privilege to quarrel over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve taken a load off my shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit down and tell me all about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant sit down he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his immediate response was to throw himself into the armchair at her side where he lounged for a moment without speaking his legs stretched out his arms locked behind his thrownback head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anna her eyes on his face waited quietly for him to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellof course it was just what one expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she takes it so badly you mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the heavy batteries were brought up my father givre monsieur de chantelle the throne and the altar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even my poor mother was dragged out of oblivion and armed with imaginary protests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellyou were prepared for all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i was till i began to hear her say it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it sounded so incredibly silly that i told her so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a fool but i couldnt help it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youve mortally offended her i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats exactly what i wanted to prevent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laid a hand on his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you tiresome boy not to wait and let me speak for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he moved slightly away so that her hand slipped from its place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont understand he said frowning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see how i can till you explain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you thought the time had come to tell your grandmother why not have asked me to do it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had my reasons for waiting but if youd told me to speak i should have done so naturally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he evaded her appeal by a sudden turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what were your reasons for waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her stepsons eyes were on her face and under his gaze she felt a faint disquietude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was feeling my way...i wanted to be absolutely sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she delayed again for a just perceptible instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why simply of our side of the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you told me you were the other day when we talked it over before they came back from ouchy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh my dearif you think that in such a complicated matter every day every hour doesnt more or less modify ones surest sureness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats just what im driving at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to know what has modified yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made a slight gesture of impatience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what does it matter now the things done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know that i could give any clear reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he got to his feet and stood looking down on her with a tormented brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its absolutely necessary that you should <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at his tone her impatience flared up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not necessary that i should give you any explanation whatever since youve taken the matter out of my hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all i can say is that i was trying to help you that no other thought ever entered my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused a moment and then added if you doubted it you were right to do what youve done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he retorted with a fugitive stress on the pronoun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face had cleared to its old look of trust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont be offended if ive seemed to he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant quite explain myself either...its all a kind of tangle isnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why i thought id better speak at once or rather why i didnt think at all but just suddenly blurted the thing out anna gave him back his look of conciliation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well the how and why dont much matter now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the point is how to deal with your grandmother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve not told me what she means to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh she means to send for adelaide painter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the name drew a faint note of mirth from him and relaxed both their faces to a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps anna added its really the best thing for us all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dragging that woman into our secrets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this could hardly be a secret much longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had moved to the hearth where he stood pushing about the small ornaments on the mantelshelf but at her answer he turned back to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent of course spoken of it to any one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no but i intend to now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused for his reply and as it did not come she continued if adelaide painters to be told theres no possible reason why i shouldnt tell mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> owen abruptly set down the little statuette between his fingers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none whatever i want every one to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she smiled a little at his overemphasis and was about to meet it with a word of banter when he continued facing her you havent as yet said a word to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive told him nothing except what the discussion of our own planshis and mineobliged me to that you were thinking of marrying and that i wasnt willing to leave france till id done what i could to see you through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at her first words the colour had rushed to his forehead but as she continued she saw his face compose itself and his blood subside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had my word you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thats allpositively allyouve ever said to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a moments embarrassed hesitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was understood wasnt it that my grandmother was to be the first to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> welland so she has been hasnt she since youve told her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned back to his restless shifting of the knickknacks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youre sure that nothing youve said to darrow could possibly have given him a hint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do you put it in that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whyas if you thought some one else might have spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what on earth my dear boy can you be driving at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im trying to find out whether you think he knows anything definite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughed at his obstinate insistence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to test my veracity i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sound of a step in the gallery she added here he isyou can ask him yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she met darrows knock with an invitation to enter and he came into the room and paused between herself and owen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was struck as he stood there by the contrast between his happy careless goodlooks and her stepsons frowning agitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow met her eyes with a smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or is our walk given up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i was just going to get ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued to linger between the two looking slowly from one to the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theres something we want to tell you first owen is engaged to miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sense of an indefinable interrogation in owens mind made her as she spoke fix her eyes steadily on darrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had paused just opposite the window so that even in the rainy afternoon light his face was clearly open to her scrutiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a second immense surprise was alone visible on it so visible that she half turned to her stepson with a faint smile for his refuted suspicions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why she wondered should owen have thought that darrow had already guessed his secret and what after all could be so disturbing to him in this not improbable contingency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate his doubt must have been dispelled there was nothing feigned about darrows astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when her eyes turned back to him he was already crossing to owen with outstretched hand and she had through an unaccountable faint flutter of misgiving a mere confused sense of their exchanging the customary phrases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her next perception was of owens tranquillized look and of his smiling return of darrows congratulatory grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had the eerie feeling of having been overswept by a shadow which there had been no cloud to cast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later owen had left the room and she and darrow were alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had turned away to the window and stood staring out into the downpour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i am surprised he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you hadnt thought of its being miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should i have thought of miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see now why i wanted so much to find out what you knew about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made no comment and she pursued now that you do know its she if theres anything he moved back into the room and went up to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was serious with a slight shade of annoyance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what on earth should there be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i told you ive never in my life heard any one say two words about miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anna made no answer and they continued to face each other without moving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the moment she had ceased to think about sophy viner and owen the only thought in her mind was that darrow was alone with her close to her and that for the first time their hands and lips had not met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he glanced back doubtfully at the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps youd rather not go out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hesitated as if waiting for him to urge her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to go at once to my mother inlawowens just been telling her she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that accounts for my having on my way up heard some one telephoning for miss painter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the allusion they laughed together vaguely and anna moved toward the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held it open for her and followed her out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left her at the door of madame de chantelles sitting room and plunged out alone into the rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind flung about the stripped treetops of the avenue and dashed the stinging streams into his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked to the gate and then turned into the highroad and strode along in the open buffeted by slanting gusts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the evenly ridged fields were a blurred waste of mud and the russet coverts which he and owen had shot through the day before shivered desolately against a driving sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow walked on and on indifferent to the direction he was taking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his thoughts were tossing like the treetops <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annas announcement had not come to him as a complete surprise that morning as he strolled back to the house with owen leath and miss viner he had had a momentary intuition of the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it had been no more than an intuition the merest faint cloudpuff of surmise and now it was an attested fact darkening over the whole sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in respect of his own attitude he saw at once that the discovery made no appreciable change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had been bound to silence before he was no less bound to it now the only difference lay in the fact that what he had just learned had rendered his bondage more intolerable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hitherto he had felt for sophy viners defenseless state a sympathy profoundly tinged with compunction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now he was halfconscious of an obscure indignation against her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> superior as he had fancied himself to readymade judgments he was aware of cherishing the common doubt as to the disinterestedness of the woman who tries to rise above her past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder she had been sick with fear on meeting him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in his power to do her more harm than he had dreamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> assuredly he did not want to harm her but he did desperately want to prevent her marrying owen leath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to get away from the feeling to isolate and exteriorize it sufficiently to see what motives it was made of but it remained a mere blind motion of his blood the instinctive recoil from the thing that no amount of arguing can make straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tramp prolonged as it was carried him no nearer to enlightenment and after trudging through two or three sallow mudstained villages he turned about and wearily made his way back to givre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he walked up the black avenue making for the lights that twinkled through its pitching branches he had a sudden realisation of his utter helplessness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might think and combine as he would but there was nothing absolutely nothing that he could do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dropped his wet coat in the vestibule and began to mount the stairs to his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on the landing he was overtaken by a soberfaced maid who in tones discreetly lowered begged him to be so kind as to step for a moment into the marquises sittingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somewhat disconcerted by the summons he followed its bearer to the door at which a couple of hours earlier he had taken leave of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it opened to admit him to a large lamplit room which he immediately perceived to be empty and the fact gave him time to note even through his disturbance of mind the interesting degree to which madame de chantelles apartment dated and completed her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its looped and corded curtains its purple satin upholstery the sevres jardinieres the rosewood firescreen the little velvet tables edged with lace and crowded with silver knickknacks and simpering miniatures reconstituted an almost perfect setting for the blonde beauty of the sixties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow wondered that fraser leaths filial respect should have prevailed over his aesthetic scruples to the extent of permitting such an anachronism among the eighteenth century graces of givre but a moments reflection made it clear that to its late owner the attitude would have seemed exactly in the traditions of the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de chantelles emergence from an inner room snatched darrow from these irrelevant musings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was already beaded and bugled for the evening and save for a slight pinkness of the eyelids her elaborate appearance revealed no mark of agitation but darrow noticed that in recognition of the solemnity of the occasion she pinched a lace handkerchief between her thumb and forefinger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she plunged at once into the centre of the difficulty appealing to him in the name of all the everards to descend there with her to the rescue of her darling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wasnt she was sure addressing herself in vain to one whose person whose tone whose traditions so brilliantly declared his indebtedness to the principles she besought him to defend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her own reception of darrow the confidence she had at once accorded him must have shown him that she had instinctively felt their unanimity of sentiment on these fundamental questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had in fact recognized in him the one person whom without pain to her maternal piety she could welcome as her sons successor and it was almost as to owens father that she now appealed to darrow to aid in rescuing the wretched boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont think please that im casting the least reflection on anna or showing any want of sympathy for her when i say that i consider her partly responsible for whats happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anna is moderni believe thats what its called when you read unsettling books and admire hideous pictures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed madame de chantelle continued leaning confidentially forward i myself have always more or less lived in that atmosphere my son you know was very revolutionary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only he didnt of course apply his ideas they were purely intellectual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats what dear anna has always failed to understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and im afraid shes created the same kind of confusion in owens mindled him to mix up things you read about with things you do...you know of course that she sides with him in this wretched business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> developing at length upon this theme she finally narrowed down to the point of darrows intervention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow calls me illogical and uncharitable because my feelings toward miss viner have changed since ive heard this news <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve known her it appears for some years anna tells me you used to see her when she was a companion or secretary or something to a dreadfully vulgar mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i ask you as a friend i ask you as one of us to tell me if you think a girl who has had to knock about the world in that kind of position and at the orders of all kinds of people is fitted to be owens wife im not implying anything against her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fearful storm broke over us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all round was like a lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred and i sat back to back perched on a flour bag till daylight with no covering but our shooting jackets our feet in a pool and bodies streaming like cascades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeated lightning seemed to strike the ground within a few yards of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the animals wild with terror stampeded in all directions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning lo and behold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson on his back in the water insensibly drunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first i thought he was dead but he was only dead drunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant move till he can unless we bequeath him to the wolves which are plentiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is the third time he has served us the same trick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took the liberty to ram my heel through the whisky keg we have kept a small one for there were plenty of days and nights to match these but there were worse in store for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one evening travelling along the north platte river before reaching laramie we overtook a mormon family on their way to salt lake city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had a light covered wagon with hardly anything in it but a small supply of flour and bacon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was drawn by four oxen and two cows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mans name was blazzard a yorkshireman from the wolds whose speech was that of learoyd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had only his wife and a very pretty daughter of sixteen or seventeen with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we asked him how he became a mormon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he answered from conviction and entreated us to be baptized in the true faith at his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the offer was tempting for the pretty little milkmaid might have become one of ones wives on the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in truth the sweet nymph urged conversion more persuasively than her papa though with what views who shall say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old farmers acquaintance with the bible was remarkable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he quoted it at every sentence and was eloquent upon the subject of the meaning and the origin of the word bible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he assured us the name was given to the holy book from the circumstance of its contents having passed a synod of prophets just as an act of parliament passes the house of commons by bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was this historical fact that guaranteed the authenticity of the sacred volume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are various reasons for believing this is one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day being sunday was spent in sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the afternoon i helped the yorkshire lassie to herd her cattle which had strayed a long distance amongst the rank herbage by the banks of the platte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heat was intense well over in the sun and the mosquitos rose in clouds at every step in the wet grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an easy job for me on my little grey to gallop after the cows and drive them home it would have been a wearisome one for her and she was very grateful and played dorothea to my hermann <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of our party wore any upper clothing except a flannel shirt i had cut off the sleeves of mine at the elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was better for rough work but the broiling sun had raised big blisters on my arms and throat which were very painful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we got back to camp dorothea laved the burns for me with cool milk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was very pretty and what blackguard heine as carlyle dubs him would have called naive schmutzig <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we parted next morning i thought with a sigh that before the autumn was over she would be in the seraglio of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brigham young who artemus ward used to say was the most married sport had been the final cause of my trip to america sport and the love of adventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the bison buffalo as they are called are now extinct except in preserved districts a few words about them as they then were may interest game hunters of the present day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no description could convey an adequate conception of the numbers in which they congregated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the admirable illustrations in catlins great work on the north american indians afford the best idea to those who have never seen the wonderful sight itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the districts they frequented were vast sandy uplands sparsely covered with the tufty buffalo or gramma grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these regions were always within reach of the watercourses to which morning and evening the herds descended by paths after the manner of sheep or cattle in a pasture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never shall i forget the first time i witnessed the extraordinary event of the evening drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing the black masses galloping down towards the river by the banks of which our party were travelling we halted some hundred yards short of the tracks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to have been caught amongst the animals would have been destruction for do what they would to get out of ones way the weight of the thousands pushing on would have crushed anything that impeded them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the occasion i refer to we approached to within safe distance and fired into them till the ammunition in our pouches was expended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as examples of our sporting exploits three days taken almost at random will suffice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the season was so far advanced that unless we were to winter at fort laramie it was necessary to keep going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was therefore agreed that whoever left the line of march that is the vicinity of the north platte for the purpose of hunting should take his chance of catching up the rest of the party who were to push on as speedily as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on two of the days which i am about to record this rule nearly brought me into trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i quote from my left camp to hunt by self <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got a shot at some deer lying in long grass on banks of a stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while stalking i could hardly see or breathe for mosquitos they were in my eyes nose and mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steady aim was impossible and to my disgust i missed the easiest of shots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the neck and flanks of my little grey are as red as if painted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is weak from loss of blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freds head is now so swollen he cannot wear his hard hat his eyes are bunged up and his face is comic to look at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several deer and antelopes but ground too level and game too wild to let one near <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hardly caring what direction i took followed outskirts of large wood four or five miles away from the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> saw a good many summer lodges but knew by the quantity of game that the indians had deserted them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the afternoon came suddenly upon deer and singling out one of the youngest fawns tried to run it down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the country being very rough i found it hard work to keep between it and the wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first my hat blew off then a pistol jumped out of the holster but i was too near to give up meaning to return for these things afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two or three times i ran right over the fawn which bleated in the most piteous manner but always escaped the deathblow from the greys hoofs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees we edged nearer to the thicket when the fawn darted down the side of a bluff and was lost in the long grass and brushwood i followed at full speed but unable to arrest the impetus of the horse we dashed headlong into the thick scrub and were both thrown with violence to the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was none the worse but the poor beast had badly hurt his shoulder and for the time was dead lame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for an hour at least i hunted for my pistol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was much more to me than my hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a huge horse pistol that threw an ounce ball of exactly the calibre of my double rifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had shot several buffaloes with it by riding close to them in a chase and when in danger of indians i loaded it with slugs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was getting late and i didnt rightly know where i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made for the low country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as we camped last night at least two miles from the river on account of the swamps the difficulty was to find the tracks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor little grey and i hunted for it in vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wet ground was too wet the dry ground too hard to show the tracks in the now imperfect light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the situation was a disagreeable one it might be two or three days before i again fell in with my friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not touched food since the early morning and was rather done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to return to the high ground was to give up for the night but that meant another day behind the cavalcade with diminished chance of overtaking it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the dusk i saw what i fancied was something moving on a mound ahead of me which arose out of the surrounding swamp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spurred on but only to find the putrid carcase of a buffalo with a wolf supping on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brute was gorged and looked as sleek as die schone frau giermund but unlike isegrims spouse she was free to escape for she wasnt worth a bullet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was so famished that i examined the carcase with the hope of finding a cut that would last for a day or two my nose wouldnt have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i plodded on the water up to the saddle girths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mosquitos swarmed in millions and the poor little grey could hardly get one leg before the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i too was so feverish that ignorant of bacteria i filled my round hat with the filthy stagnant water and drank it at a draught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last i made for higher ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was too dark to hunt for tracks so i began to look out for a level bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly my beast who jogged along with his nose to the ground gave a loud neigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i threw the reins on his neck and left matters to his superior instincts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in less than half an hour the joyful light of a camp fire gladdened my eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred told me he had halted as soon as he was able not on my account only but because he too had had a severe fall and was suffering great pain from a july nd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with jim the halfbreed to the hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner on high ground than we sighted game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as far as eye could reach right away to the horizon the plain was black with buffaloes a truly astonishing sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stopped to spy them with amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nearest were not more than half a mile off so we picketed our horses under the sky line and choosing the hollows walked on till crawling became expedient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as is their wont the outsiders were posted on bluffs or knolls in a commanding position these were old bulls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to my inexperience our chance of getting a shot seemed small for we had to cross the dipping ground under the brow whereon the sentinels were lying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> three extra difficulties beset us the prairie dogs a marmot so called from its doglike bark when disturbed were all round us and bolted into their holes like rabbits directly they saw us coming two big grey wolves the regular camp followers of a herd were prowling about in a direct line between us and the bulls lastly the cows though up and feeding were inconveniently out of reach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the meat of the young cow is much preferred to that of the bull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed my leader to a wink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only instruction i didnt like when we started crawling on the hot sand was look out for rattlesnakes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wolves stopped examined us suspiciously then quietly trotted off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what with this and the alarm of the prairie dogs an old bull a patriarch of the tribe jumped up and walked with majestic paces to the top of the knoll <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we lay flat on our faces till he satisfied with the result of his scrutiny resumed his recumbent posture but with his head turned straight towards us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jim to my surprise stealthily crawled on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in another minute or two we had gained a point whence we could see through the grass without being seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we rested to recover breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meanwhile three or four young cows fed to within sixty or seventy yards of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unluckily we both selected the same animal and both fired at the same moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> off went the lot helter skelter all save the old bull who roared out his rage and trotted up close to our hiding place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look out for a bolt whispered jim but dont show yourself nohow till i tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a minute or two the suspense was exciting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his majesty saw us not and turned again to his wives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we instantly reloaded and the startled herd which had only moved a few yards gave us the chance of a second shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first cow had fallen dead almost where she stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second we found at the foot of the hill also with two bullet wounds behind the shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tongues humps and tender loins with some other choice morsels were soon cut off and packed and we returned to camp with a grand supply of beef for jacobs larder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the risk of being tedious i will tell of one more days buffalo hunting to show the vicissitudes of this kind of sport <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before doing so we will glance at another important feature of prairie life a camp of sioux indians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one evening after halting on the banks of the platte we heard distant sounds of tomtoms on the other side of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jim the halfbreed and louis differed as to the tribe and hence the friendliness or hostility of our neighbours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis advised saddling up and putting the night between us he regaled us to boot with a few bloodcurdling tales of indian tortures and of nous autres en haut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jim treated these with scorn and declared he knew by the tunes  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just now he asserted the sioux were friendly and this village was on its way to fort laramie to barter robes buffalo skins for blankets and ammunition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was quite willing to go over and talk to them if we had no objection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred ever ready for adventure would have joined him in a minute but the river which was running strong was full of nasty currents and his injured knee disabled him from swimming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one else seemed tempted so following jims example i stripped to my flannel shirt and moccasins and crossed the river which was easier to get into than out of and soon reached the village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jim was right they were sioux and friendly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they offered us a pipe of kinik the dried bark of the red willow and jabbered away with their kinsman who seemed almost more at home with them than with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing one of their braves with three fresh scalps at his belt i asked for the history of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in sioux gutturals the story was a long one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jims translation amounted to this the scalps were lifted from two crows and a ponkaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crows it appeared were the sioux natural enemies anyhow for they occasionally hunted on each others ranges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the ponkaw whom he would not otherwise have injured was casually met by him on a horse which the sioux recognised for a white mans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon being questioned how he came by it the ponkaw simply replied that it was his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon the sioux called him a liar and proved it by sending an arrow through his body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then strictly speaking i am no collector of scalps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to preserve my own i kept the hair on it as short as a toothbrush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before we left our hosts fed us on raw buffalo meat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this cut in slices and dried crisp in the sun is excellent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their lodges were very comfortable most of them large enough to hold a dozen people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ground inside was covered with buffalo robes and the sewn skins spread tight upon the converging poles formed a tent stout enough to defy all weathers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in winter the lodge can be entirely closed and when a fire is kindled in the centre the smoke escaping at a small hole where the poles join the snugness is complete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the entrance of one of these lodges i watched a squaw and her child prepare a meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the fuel was collected a fat puppy playing with the child was seized by the squaw and knocked on the throat not head with a stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the puppy was then returned kicking to the tender mercies of the infant who exerted its small might to add to the animals miseries while the mother fed the fire and filled a kettle for the stew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the puppy much more alive than dead was held by the hind leg over the flames as long as the squaws fingers could stand them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then let it fall on the embers where it struggled and squealed horribly and would have wriggled off but for the little savage who took good care to provide for the satisfactory singeing of its playmate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> considering the length of its lineage how remarkably hale and well preserved is our own barbarity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we may now take our last look at the buffaloes for we shall july th <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men sulky because they have nothing to eat but rancid ham and biscuit dust which has been so often soaked that it is mouldy and sour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson and i left camp early with the hopes of getting meat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he was shooting prairie dogs his horse made off and cost me nearly an hours riding to catch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then accidentally letting go of my mustang he too escaped and i had to run him down with the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards evening spied a small band of buffaloes which we approached by leading our horses up a hollow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they got our wind however and were gone before we were aware of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were all young and so fast it took a twenty minutes gallop to come up with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samsons horse put his foot in a hole and the cropper they both got gave the band a long start as it became a stern chase and no heading off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length i managed to separate one from the herd by firing my pistol into the brown and then devoted my efforts to him alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once or twice he turned and glared savagely through his mane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when quite isolated he pulled up short so did i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were about sixty yards apart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i flung the reins upon the neck of the mustang who was too blown to stir and handling my rifle waited for the bull to move so that i might see something more than the great shaggy front which screened his body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he stood his ground tossing up the sand with his hoofs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently instead of turning tail he put his head down and bellowing with rage came at me as hard as he could tear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had but a moment for decision to dig spurs into the mustang or risk the shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i chose the latter paused till i was sure of his neck and fired when he was almost under me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant i was sent flying and the mustang was on his back with all four legs in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bull was probably as much astonished as we were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his charge had carried him about thirty yards at most beyond us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he now stood facing me pawing the ground and snorting as before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> badly wounded i knew him to be that was the worst of it especially as my rifle with its remaining loaded barrel lay right between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to hesitate for a second only was to lose the game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no time to think of bruises i crawled eyes on him straight for my weapon got it it was already cocked and the stock unbroken raised my knee for a rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were only twenty yards apart the shot meant death for one of the two and just catching a glimpse of his shoulderblade i pulled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could hear the thud of the heavy bullet and what was sweeter music the ugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beast dropped on his knees and a gush of blood spurted from his nostrils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the wild devil of a mustang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was my first thought now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever one dismounted it was necessary to loosen his long lariat and let it trail on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without this there was no chance of catching him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw at once what had happened by the greatest good fortune at the last moment he must have made an instinctive start which probably saved his life and mine too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bulls horns had just missed his entrails and my leg we were broadside on to the charge and had caught him in the thigh below the hip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a big hole and he was bleeding plentifully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all that he wouldnt let me catch him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could go faster on three legs than i on two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was getting dark i had not touched food since starting nor had i wetted my lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the travelling rule about keeping on was an ugly incubus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson would go his own ways he had sense enough for that but how when where was i to quench my thirst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the tip of lazarus finger or for choice a bottle of bass to cool my tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then too whither would the mustang stray in the night if i rested or fell asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again and again i tried to stalk him by the starlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twice i got hold of his tail but he broke away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i drove him down to the river banks the chance of catching him would be no better and i should lose the dry ground to rest on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was about as unpleasant a night as i had yet passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every now and then i sat down and dropped off to sleep from sheer exhaustion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every time this happened i dreamed of sparkling drinks then woke with a start to a lively sense of the reality and anxious searches for the mustang <end> <end> 
<start> <start> directly the day dawned i drove the animal now very stiff straight down for the platte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted water fully as much as his master and when we sighted it he needed no more driving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a hurry was he in that in his rush for the river he got bogged in the muddy swamp at its edge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seized my chance and had him fast in a minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we both plunged into the stream i clothes and all and drank and that evening i caught up the cavalcade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how curious it is to look back upon such experiences from a different stage of lifes journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how would it have fared with me had my rifle exploded with the fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was knocked out of my hands at full cock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how if the stock had been broken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been thrown at least ten yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how if the horn had entered my thigh instead of the horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how if i had fractured a limb or had been stunned or the bull had charged again while i was creeping up to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> any one or more than one of these contingencies were more likely to happen than not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but nothing did happen save the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a thought of the kind ever crossed my mind either at the time or afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet i was not a thoughtless man only an average man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nine englishmen out of ten with a love of sport as most englishmen are would have done and have felt just as i did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was bruised and still but so one is after a run with hounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had had many a nastier fall hunting in derbyshire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the worst that could happen did not happen but the worst never well so rarely does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one might shoot oneself instead of the pigeon or be caught picking forbidden fruit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> narrow escapes are as good as broad ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the truth is when we are young and active and healthy whatever happens of the pleasant or lucky kind we accept as a matter of course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we only knew when we were well off when we were happy when we possessed all that this world has to give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we but knew that love is only a matter of course so long as youth and its bounteous train is ours we might perhaps make the most of it and give up looking for something better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give up pursuit the effort that makes us strong <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give up the sweets of hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tis better as it is perhaps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kitten plays with its tail and the nightingale sings but they think no more of happiness than the rosebud of its beauty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may be happiness comes not of too much knowing or too much thinking either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fort laramie was a military station and trading post combined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a stone building in what they called a compound or open space enclosed by a palisade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we arrived there it was occupied by a troop of mounted riflemen under canvas outside the compound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the officers lived in the fort and as we had letters to the colonel somner and to the captain rhete they were very kind and very useful to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we pitched our camp by the laramie river four miles from the fort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nearer than that there was not a blade of grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cavalry horses and military mules needed all there was at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of the mules we were allowed to buy or exchange for our own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we accordingly added six fresh ones to our cavalcade and parted with two horses which gave us a total of fifteen mules and six horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> government provisions were not to be had so that we could not replenish our now impoverished stock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a serious matter as will be seen before long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor was the evil lessened by my being laid up with a touch of fever the effect no doubt of those drenches of stagnant water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not be taken into the fort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as we had no tent and had thrown away almost everything but the clothes we wore i had to rough it and take my chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some relics of our medicine chest together with a tough constitution pulled me through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was much weakened and by no means fit for the work before us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred did his best to persuade me from going further <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he confessed that he was utterly sick of the expedition that his injured knee prevented him from hunting or from being of any use in packing and camp work that the men were a set of ruffians who did just as they chose they grumbled at the hardships yet helped themselves to the stores without restraint that we had the rocky mountains yet to cross after that the country was unknown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel somner had strongly advised us to turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forty of his men had tried two months ago to carry despatches to the regiments headquarters in oregon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only five had got through the rest had been killed and scalped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally that we had something like miles to go and were already in the middle of august <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be folly obstinacy madness to attempt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would stop and hunt where we were as long as i liked or he would go back with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would hire fresh good men and buy new horses and now that we knew the country we could get to st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis before the end of september and  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no reasonable answer to be made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply told him i had thought it over and had decided to go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like the plucky fellow and staunch friend that he was he merely shrugged his shoulders and before leaving fort laramie a singular incident occurred which must seem so improbable that its narration may be taken for fiction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was plenty of game near our camping ground and though the weather was very hot one of the party usually took the trouble to bring in something to keep the pot supplied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sage hens the buffalo or elk meat were handed over to jacob who made a stew with bacon and rice enough for the evening meal and the morrows breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after supper when everyone had filled his stomach the large kettle covered with its lid was taken off the fire and this allowed to burn itself out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for four or five mornings running the kettle was found nearly empty and all hands had to put up with a cup of coffee and mouldy biscuit dust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a good deal of unparliamentary language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everyone accused everyone else of filthy greediness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was disgusting that after eating all he could a man hadnt the decency to wait till the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pot had been full for supper and as every man could see it was never half emptied enough was always left for breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a resolution was accordingly passed that each should take his turn of an hours watch at night till the glutton was caught in the act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my hour happened to be from to pm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i strongly suspected the thief to be an indian and loaded my big pistol with slugs on the chance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a clear moonlight night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i propped myself comfortably with a bag of hams and concealed myself as well as i could in a bush of artemisia which was very thick all round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not long been on the lookout when a large grey wolf prowled slowly out of the bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was bright as day but every one of the men was sound asleep in a circle round the remains of the camp fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wolf passed between them hesitating as it almost touched a covering blanket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> step by step it crept up to the kettle took the handle of the lid between its jaws lifted it off placed it noiselessly on the ground and devoured the savoury stew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not fire because of the men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dared not move lest i should disturb the robber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was even afraid the click of cocking the pistol would startle him and prevent my getting a quiet shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when satiated the brute retired as stealthily as he had advanced and as he passed within seven or eight yards of me i let him have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great was my disappointment to see him scamper off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how was it possible i could have missed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must have fired over his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men jumped to their feet and clutched their rifles but though astonished at my story were soon at rest again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after this the kettle was never robbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four days later we were annoyed with such a stench that it was a question of shifting our quarters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in hunting for the nuisance amongst the thicket of wormwood the dead wolf was discovered not twenty yards from our centre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reader would not thank me for an account of the monotonous drudgery the hardships the quarrellings which grew worse from day to day after we left fort laramie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred and i were about the only two who were on speaking terms we clung to each other as a sort of forlorn security against coming disasters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gradually it was dawning on me that under the existing circumstances the fulfilment of my hopes would be as fred had predicted an impossibility and that to persist in the attempt to realise them was to court destruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as yet i said nothing of this to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps i secretly acknowledged to myself that he had been wiser than i and that my stubbornness was responsible for the life itself of every one of the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless thoughts akin to these must often have haunted the mind of my companion but he never murmured only uttered a hasty objurgation when troubles reached a climax and invariably ended with a burst of cheery laughter which only the sulkiest could resist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was after a day of severe trials he proposed that we should go off by ourselves for a couple of nights in search of game of which we were much in need <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men were easily persuaded to halt and rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson had become a sort of nonentity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dysentery had terribly reduced his strength and with it such intelligence as he could boast of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we started at daybreak right glad to be alone together and away from the penal servitude to which we were condemned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we made for the sweetwater not very far from the foot of the south pass where antelope and black tailed deer abounded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we failed however to get near them stalk after stalk miscarried <end> <end> 
<start> <start> disappointed and tired we were looking out for some snug little hollow where we could light a fire without its being seen by the indians when just as we found what we wanted an antelope trotted up to a brow to inspect us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a fairly good shot at him and missed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> meat was the one thing we now sorely needed to save the rapidly diminishing supply of hams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred said nothing but i saw by his look how this trifling accident helped to depress him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was ready to cry with vexation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my rifle was my pride the stag of my life my alter ego <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was never out of my hands every day i practised at prairie dogs at sage hens at a mark even if there was no game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few days before we got to laramie i had killed right and left two wild ducks the second on the wing and now when so much depended on it i could not hit a thing as big as a donkey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact is i was the worse for illness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had constant returns of fever with bad shivering fits which did not improve the steadiness of ones hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however we managed to get a supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while we were examining the spot where the antelope had stood a leveret jumped up and i knocked him over with my remaining barrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we fried him in the one tin plate we had brought with us and thought it the most delicious dish we had had for weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we lay side by side smoke curling peacefully from our pipes we chatted far into the night of other days of cambridge of our college friends of london of the opera of balls of women the last a fruitful subject and of the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was vastly amused at his sudden outburst as some start of one of the horses picketed close to us reminded us of the actual present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever i get out of this dd mess he exclaimed ill never go anywhere without my own french cook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kept his word to the end of his life i believe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a delightful repose a complete forgetting for a night at any rate of all impending care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each was cheered and strengthened for the work to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spirit of enterprise the love of adventure restored for the moment believed itself a match for come what would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very animals seemed invigorated by the rest and the abundance of rich grass spreading as far as we could see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning was bright and cool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a delicious bath in the sweetwater a breakfast on fried ham and coffee and once more in our saddles on the way back to camp we felt or fancied that we felt prepared for anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is just what we were not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson and the men meeting with no game where we had left them had moved on that afternoon in search of better hunting grounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result was that when we overtook them we found five mules up to their necks in a muddy creek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the packs were sunk to the bottom and the animals nearly drowned or strangled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred and i rushed to the rescue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once we cut the ropes which tied them together and setting the men to pull at tails or heads succeeded at last in extricating them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our newborn vigour was nipped in the bud <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were all drenched to the skin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two packs containing the miserable remains of our wardrobe freds and mine were lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the catastrophe produced a good deal of bad language and bad blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> translated into english it came to this they had trusted to us taking it for granted we knew what we were about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what business had we to boss the party if we were as ignorant as the mules <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had guaranteed to lead them through to california  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and had brought them into this almighty fix to slave like niggers and to starve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was just truth enough in the jeremiad to make it sting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would not have been prudent nay not very safe to return curse for curse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the breaking point was reached at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night i for one had not much sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was soaked from head to foot and had not a dry rag for a change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alternate fits of fever and rigor would alone have kept me awake but renewed ponderings upon the situation and confirmed convictions of the peremptory necessity of breaking up the party forced me to the conclusion that this was the right the only course to adopt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for another twentyfour hours i brooded over my plans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two main difficulties confronted me the announcement to the men who might mutiny and the parting with fred which i dreaded far the most of the two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would he not think it treacherous to cast him off after the sacrifices he had made for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> implicitly we were as good as pledged to stand by each other to the last gasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was it not mean and dastardly to run away from the battle because it was dangerous to fight it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had friendship no claims superior to personal safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was not my decision prompted by sheer selfishness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could anything be said in its defence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes sentiment must yield to reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to go on was certain death for all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not too late to return for those who wished it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when i had demonstrated as i could easily do the impossibility of continuance each one could decide for himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men were as reckless as they were ignorant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however they might execrate us we were still their natural leaders their blame indeed implied they felt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sentimental argument could obscure this truth and this conviction was decisive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next night and the day after were from a moral point of view the most trying perhaps of the whole journey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had halted on a wide open plain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> due west of us in the far distance rose the snowy peaks of the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the prairie on that side terminated in bluffs rising gradually to higher spurs of the range <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the packs were thrown off and the men had turned as usual to help themselves to supper i drew fred aside and imparted my resolution to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened to it calmly much more so than i had expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet it was easy to see by his unusual seriousness that he fully weighed the gravity of the purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all he said at the we did so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we placed our saddles side by side they were our regular pillows and covering ourselves with the same blanket well out of earshot discussed the proposition from every practical aspect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he now combated my scheme as i always supposed he would by laying stress upon our bond of friendship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was met on my part by the arguments already set forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then proposed an amendment which almost upset my decision <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true he admitted that we cannot get through as we are going now the provisions will not hold out another month and it is useless to attempt to control the men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there are two ways out of the difficulty we can reach salt lake city and winter there or if you are bent on going to california why shouldnt we take jacob and nelson the canadian pay off the rest of the brutes and travel whether das ewig wirkende that shapes our ends be beneficent or malignant is not easy to tell till after the event <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certain it is that sometimes we seem impelled by latent forces stronger than ourselves if by self be meant ones will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cannot give a reason for all we do the infinite chain of cause and effect which has had no beginning and will have no end is part of the reckoning with this finite minds can never grapple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was destined my stubbornness was none of my making that i should remain obdurate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freds last resource was an attempt to persuade me he really believed i too thought it likely that the men would show fight annex beasts and provisions and leave us to shift for ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were six of them armed as we were to us three or rather us two for samson was a negligible quantity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall see said i and by degrees we dropped asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before the first streak of dawn i was up and off to hunt for the horses and mules which were now allowed to roam in search of feed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on my return the men were afoot taking it easy as usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some artemisia bushes were ablaze for the mornings coffee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one but fred had a suspicion of the coming crisis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i waited till each one had lighted his pipe then quietly requested the lot to gather the provision packs together as it was desirable to take stock and make some estimate of demand and supply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said i turn all the hams out of their bags and let us see how long they will last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i exclaimed with well feigned dismay thats not all surely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are not enough here to last a fortnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mens faces fell but never a murmur nor a sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here spread these empty ham sacks and pour the biscuit on to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont lose any of the dust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall want every crumb mouldy or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing as i think all will agree is to divide what is left into nine equal shares thats our number now and let each one take his ninth part to do what he likes with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you yourselves shall portion out the shares and then draw lots this presentation of the inevitable compelled submission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole amounting to twelve light mule packs it had been fifteen fairly heavy ones after our purchases at fort laramie was still a goodly bulk to look at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nine peddling dividends when seen singly were not quite what the shareholders had anticipated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did they not rebel and visit their wrath upon the directors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because they knew in their hearts that we had again and again predicted the catastrophe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they knew we had warned them scores and scores of times of the consequences of their wilful and reckless improvidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were stupefied aghast at the ruin they had brought upon themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to turn upon us to murder us and divide our three portions between them would have been suicidal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place our situation was as desperate as theirs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we should fight for our lives and it was not certain in fact it was improbable that either jacob or william would side against us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without our aid they had not a compass among them they were helpless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the instinct of selfpreservation bade them trust to our good will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far then the game was won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost humbly they asked what we advised them to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answer was prompt and decisive get back to fort laramie as fast as you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly not we were english gentlemen and would behave as such <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each man should have his own mule each into the bargain should receive his pay according to agreement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then very strongly counselled them not to travel together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> past experience proved how dangerous this must be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to avoid the temptation even the chance of this happening the surest and safest plan would be for each party to start separately and not leave till the last was out of sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my part i had resolved to go alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a melancholy day for everyone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to fill the cup of wretchedness to overflowing the rain beginning with a drizzle ended with a downpour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> consultations took place between men who had not spoken to one another for weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred offered to go on at all events to salt lake city if nelson the canadian and jacob would go with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both eagerly closed with the offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they would be so much nearer to the diggings and were moreover fond of their leader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> louis would go back to fort laramie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> potter and morris would cross the mountains and strike south for the mormon city if their provisions and mules threatened to give out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> william would try his luck alone in the same way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there remained no one but samson undecided and unprovided for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strong weak man sat on the ground in the steady rain smoking pipe after pipe watching first the preparations then the departures one after the other at intervals of an hour or so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> first the singles then the pair then late in the afternoon fred and his two henchmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is needless to depict our separation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think either expected ever to see the other again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet we parted after the manner of trueborn britons as if we should meet again in a day or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a beastly day isnt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but emotions are only partially suppressed by subduing their expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hearts of both were full <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i watched the gradual disappearance of my dear friend and thought with a sigh of my loss in jacob and nelson the two best men of the band <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a comfort to reflect that they had joined fred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacob especially was full of resource nelson of energy and determination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the courage and cool judgment of fred and his presence of mind in emergencies were all pledges for the safety of the trio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they vanished behind a distant bluff i turned to the sodden wreck of the deserted camp and began actively to pack my mules <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he presently asked gazing with dull eyes at his two mules and two horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care what you do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had better pack your mules before it is dark or you may lose i may as well go with you i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont care much about he looked miserable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had held out under a long and heavy strain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> parting with fred had for the moment staggered my resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought of packing two mules twice a day singlehanded weakened as i was by illness appalled me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and though ashamed of the perversity which had led me to fling away the better and accept the worse i yielded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill it took more than an hour before the four mules were ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a fool i left samson to tie the led horses in a string while i did the same with the mules <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed with the mule train some minutes later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two spare horses were nearly as wild as the mules <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not got far when i discerned through the rain a kicking and plunging and general entanglement of the lot ahead of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson had fastened the horses together with slip knots and they were all doing their best to strangle one another and themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to leave the mules was dangerous yet two men were required to release the maddened horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the labour was accomplished and once more the van pushed on with distinct instructions as to the line of march it being now nearly dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mules had naturally vanished in the gloom and by the time i was again in my saddle samson was i knew not where <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on and on i travelled far into the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but failing to overtake my companion and taking for granted that he had missed his way i halted when i reached a stream threw off the packs let the animals loose rolled myself in my blanket and shut my eyes upon a trying day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson still in his rugs was but a couple of hundred yards further up the stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the afternoon of the third day we fell in with william <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had cut himself a long willow wand and was fishing for trout of which he had caught several in the upper reaches of the sweetwater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he threw down his rod hastened to welcome our arrival and at once begged leave to join us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was already sick of solitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had come across potter and morris who had left him that morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had been visited by wolves in the night i too had been awakened by their howlings and poor william did not relish the thought of the mountains alone with his one little white mule which he called cream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he promised to do his utmost to help with the packing and not cost us a cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not tell him how my heart yearned towards him and how miserably my courage had oozed away since we parted but made a favour of his request and granted it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gain so long as it lasted was incalculable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the summit of the south pass is between and feet above the level of the gulf of mexico <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the pass itself is many miles broad undulating on the surface but not abruptly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the peaks of the wind river chain immediately to the north are covered with snow and as we gradually got into the misty atmosphere we felt the cold severely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lariats made of raw hide became rods of ice and the poor animals whose backs were masses of festering raws suffered terribly from exposure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was interesting to come upon proofs of the divide within a mile of the most elevated point in the pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the hudson to this spot all waters had flowed eastward now suddenly every little rivulet was making for the pacific <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the descent is as gradual as the rise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the first day of it we lost two animals a mule and samsons spare horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter never equal to the heavy weight of its owner could go no further and the dreadful state of the mules back rendered packing a brutality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morris and potter who passed us a few days later told us they had seen the horse dead and partially eaten by wolves the mule they had shot to put it out of its misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in due course we reached fort hall a trading post of the hudsons bay company some miles to the northwest of the south pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir george simpson chairman of that company had given me letters which ensured the assistance of its servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was indeed a rest and a luxury to spend a couple of idle days here and revive ones dim recollection of fresh eggs and milk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we were already in september <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our animals were in a deplorable condition and with the exception of a little flour a small supply of dried meat and a horse for samson mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grant the trader had nothing to sell us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told us moreover that before we reached fort boise their next station miles further on we had to traverse a great rocky desert where we might travel four andtwenty hours after leaving water before we met with it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing for it but to press onwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was too late now to cross the sierra nevada range which lay between us and california and with the miserable equipment left to us it was all we could hope to do to reach oregon before the passage of the blue mountains was blocked by the winters snow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> grants warnings were verified to the foot of the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great were our sufferings and almost worse were those of the poor animals from the want of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then too unlike the desert of sahara where the pebbly sand affords a solid footing the soil here is the calcined powder of volcanic debris so fine that every step in it is up to ones ankles while clouds of it rose choking the nostrils and covering road rocky in places but generally deep in the finest floury sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a strong and biting wind blew dead in our teeth smothering us in dust which filled every pore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> william presented such a ludicrous appearance that samson and i went into fits over it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an old felt hat fastened on by a red cotton handkerchief tied under his chin partly hid his lanternjawed visage this naturally of a dolorous cast was screwed into wrinkled contortions by its efforts to resist the piercing gale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dust as white as flour had settled thick upon him the extremity of his nasal organ being the only rosy spot left its pearly drops lodged upon a chin almost as prominent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his shoulders were shrugged to a level with his head and his long legs dangled from the back of we laughed at him it is true but he was so goodnatured so patient so simpleminded and now and then when he and i were alone so sentimental and confidential about mary and the fortune he meant to bring her back that i had a sort of maternal liking for him and even a vicarious affection for mary herself the colour of whose eyes and hair nay whose weight avoirdupois i was now accurately acquainted with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no the honest fellow had not quite the grit of a one night when we had halted after dark he went down to a gully we were not then in the desert to look for water for our tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson armed with the hatchet was chopping wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stayed to arrange the packs and spread the blankets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly i heard a voice from the bottom of the ravine crying out bring the guns for gods sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rushed about in the dark tumbling over the saddles but could nowhere lay my hands on a rifle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still the cry was for guns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my own a muzzleloader was discharged but a rifle none the less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snatching up this and one of my pistols which by the way had fallen into the river a few hours before i shouted for samson and ran headlong to the rescue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before i got to the bottom of the hill i heard groans which sounded like the last of poor william <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i holloaed to know where he was and was answered in a voice that discovered nothing worse than terror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeared that he had met a grizzly bear drinking at the very spot where he was about to fill his can that he had bolted and the bear had pursued him but that he had cobbled the bar with rocks had hit it in the eye or nose he was not sure which and thus narrowly escaped with his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not help laughing at his story though an examination of the place next morning so far verified it that his footprints and the bears were clearly intermingled on the muddy shore of the stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to make up for his fright he was extremely courageous when restored by tea and a pipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we would follow the trail with him hed go right slick in for her anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if his rifle didnt shoot plum hed a bowie as ud rise her hide and no mistake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hed be darnd we were now steering by compass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this we kept as well as the formation of the country and the watercourses would permit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after striking the great shoshone or snake river which eventually becomes the columbia we had to follow its banks in a southerly direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are often supported by basaltic columns several hundred feet in height <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where that was the case though close to water we suffered most from want of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and cold as were the nights it was the middle of september the sun was intensely hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every day every mile we were hoping for a change not merely for access to the water but that we might again pursue our westerly course <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scenery was sometimes very striking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the river hereabouts varies from one hundred to nearly three hundred yards in width sometimes rushing through narrow gorges sometimes descending in continuous rapids sometimes spread out in smooth shallow reaches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was for one of these that we were in search for only at such points was the river passable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was nighttime when we came to one of the great falls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were able here to get at water and having halted through the day on account of the heat kept on while our animals were refreshed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had to ascend the banks again and wind along the brink of the precipice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from this the view was magnificent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moon shone brightly upon the dancing waves hundreds of feet below us and upon the rapids which extended as far as we could see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deep shade of the high cliffs contrasted in its impenetrable darkness with the brilliancy of the silvery foam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the vast plain which we overlooked fading in the soft light rose gradually into a low range of distant hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the incessant roar of the rapids and the desert stillness of all else around though they lulled ones senses yet awed one with a feeling of insignificance and impotence in the presence of such ruthless force amid such serene and cold indifference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unbidden the consciousness was there that for some of us the coming struggle with those mighty waters was fraught with life or death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last we came upon a broad stretch of the river which seemed to offer the possibilities we sought for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rather late in the afternoon we decided to cross here notwithstanding williams strong reluctance to make the venture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> part of his unwillingness was i knew due to apprehension part to his love of fishing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever since we came down upon the snake river we had seen quantities of salmon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he persisted in the belief that they were to be caught with the rod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day before all three of us had waded into the river and flogged it patiently for a couple of hours while heavy fish were tumbling about above and below us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we caught plenty of trout but never pricked a salmon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the broad reach was alive with them and william begged hard to stop for the afternoon and pursue the gentle sport <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson led the way holding the lariat to which the two spare horses were attached <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in crossing streams the mules would always follow the horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were accordingly let loose and left to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> william and i brought up the rear driving before us any mule that at about equal distances from each other and the main land were two small islands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first of these we reached without trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second was also gained but the packs were wetted the current being exceedingly rapid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the space remaining to be forded was at least two hundred yards and the stream so strong that i was obliged to turn my mares head up it to prevent her being carried off her legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while thus resting william with difficulty the water being over his knees sidled up to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted to know if i still meant to cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all answer i laughed at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in truth i had not the smallest misgiving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strong as was the current the smooth rocky bottom gave a good foothold to the animals and judging by the great width of the river there was no reason to suppose that its shallowness would not continue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we paused for a few minutes to observe samson who was now within forty or fifty yards of the opposite bank and as i concluded past all danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly to the astonishment of both of us he and his horse and the led animals disappeared under water the next instant they were struggling and swimming for the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tied together as they were there was a deal of snorting and plunging and samson with his habitual ingenuity had fastened the lariat either to himself or his saddle so that he was several times dragged under before they all got to the bank in safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these events were watched by william with intense anxiety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a pitiable look of terror he assured me he could not swim a yard it was useless for him to try to cross he would turn back and find his way to salt lake city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i remonstrated if you turn back you will certainly starve everything we possess is over there with the mules your blanket even your rifle are with the packs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is impossible to get the mules back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give little cream her head sit still in your saddle and shell carry you through that bit of deep water with ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can live by fishing he plaintively answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still held his long rod and the incongruity of it added to the pathos of his despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reminded him of a bad river we had before crossed and how his mule had swum it safely with him on her back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i promised to keep close to him and help him if need were though i was confident if he left everything to cream there would be no danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well if he must he must <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if anything happened to him would i write and tell mary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew her address leastways if i didnt it was in his bag on the brown mule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and tell her i done my best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water was so clear one could see every crack in the rock beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately i took the precaution to strip to my shirt fastened everything even my socks to the saddle then advanced cautiously ahead of william to the brink of the chasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in fact upon the edge of a precipice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could see to an inch where the gulf began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as my mare stepped into it i slipped off my saddle when she rose i laid hold of her tail and in two or three minutes should have been safe ashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking back to see how it had fared with william i at once perceived his danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had clasped his mule tightly round the neck with his arms and round the body with his long legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was plunging violently to get rid of her load <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already the pair were forty or fifty yards below me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly i turned and swam to his assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the struggles of the mule rendered it dangerous to get at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i did so he was partially dazed his hold was relaxed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dragging him away from the hoofs of the animal i begged him to put his hands on my shoulders or hips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was past any effort of the kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think he heard me even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed hardly conscious of anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his long wet hair plastered over the face concealed his features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond stretching out his arms like an infant imploring help he made no effort to save himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seized him firmly by the collar unfortunately with my right hand leaving only my left to stem the torrent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how to keep his face out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at every stroke i was losing strength we were being swept away for him to hopeless death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length i touched bottom got both hands under his head and held it above the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still breathed still puffed the hair from his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was still a hope if i could but maintain my footing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each instant i was losing ground each instant i was driven back foot by foot towards the gulf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water at first only up to my chest was now up to my shoulders now up to my neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my arms ached till they could bear no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell like lead till his back lay stretched upon the rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his arms were spread out so that his body formed a cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i paddled above it in the clear smooth water gazing at his familiar face till two or three large bubbles burst upon the surface then hardly knowing what i was doing floated mechanically from the trappers grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my turn was now to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first the right or western bank being within sixty or seventy yards being also my proper goal i struck out for it with mere eagerness to land as soon as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well then i would take it quietly not try to cross direct but swim on gently keeping my head that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees i got within twenty yards of the bank was counting joyfully on the rest which a few more strokes would bring me when wsh came a current and swept me right into the middle of the stream again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must get out of this somehow or another better on the wrong side than not at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i let myself go and made for the shore we had started from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when well over to the left bank i was carried out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was i too to be drowned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it began to look like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was getting cold numb exhausted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my flannel shirt stuck to and impeded me i would have it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got it over my head but hadnt unbuttoned the studs it stuck partly over my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tugged to tear it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got a drop of water into my windpipe was choking tugged till i got the shirt right again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tried floating on my back to cough and get my breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was setting in glorious red and gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i noticed this noticed the salmon rolling like porpoises around me and thought of william with his rod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strangest of all for i had not noticed her before little cream was still struggling for dear life not a hundred yards below me sometimes sinking sometimes reappearing but on her way to join her master as surely as i thought that i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in my distress the predominant thought was the loneliness of my fate the loneliness of my body after death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not a living thing to see me die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time i felt not fear but loss of hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could only beat the water with feeble and futile splashes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was completely at its mercy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as we all then do i prayed prayed for strength prayed that i might be spared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my legs dropped powerless in the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could but just keep my nose or mouth above it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my legs sank and my feet touched bottom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant as if from an electric shock a flush of energy suffused my brain and limbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood upright in an almost tranquil pool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an eddy had lodged me on a sandbank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between it and the land was scarcely twenty yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through this gap the stream ran strong as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not want to rest i did not pause to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in i dashed and a single spurt carried me to the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fell on my knees and with a grateful heart poured out gratitude for my deliverance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was on the wrong side the side from which we started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the river was yet to cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not tasted food since our early meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long i had been swimming i know not but it was dark now starlight at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nights were bitterly cold and my only clothing a wet flannel shirt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the craving for companionship someone to talk to even samson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a stronger need than warmth or food or clothing so strong that it impelled me to try again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor sandy soil grew nothing but briars and small cactuses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the dark i kept treading on the little prickly plants but i hurried on till i came in sight of samsons fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see his huge form as it intercepted the comfortable blaze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pictured him making his tea broiling some of williams trout and spreading his things before the fire to dry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see the animals moving around the glow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how should i reach it if ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this frame of mind the attempt was irresistible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i started as near as i could from opposite the two islands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as on horseback i got pretty easily to the first island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond this i was taken off my feet by the stream and only with difficulty did i once more regain the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my next object was to communicate with samson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by putting both hands to my mouth and shouting with all my force i made him hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see him get up and come to the waters edge though he could not see me his stentorian voice is that you william <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you remember a bend near some willows where you wanted to cross yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about two hours higher up the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you know the place again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will see me by daylight in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i start you will take my mare my clothes and some food make for that place and wait till i come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep me in sight as long as you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be gathered from my words that definite instructions were deemed necessary and the inference at least it was mine will follow that if a mistake were possible samson would avail himself of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the river had yet to be crossed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but strange as it now seems to me i had no misgivings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this i knew my trust was complete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i record this as a curious psychological occurrence for it supported me with unfailing energy through the severe trial which i had yet to our experiences are little worth unless they teach us to reflect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us then pause to consider this hourly experience of human beings this remarkable efficacy of prayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there can hardly be a contemplative mind to which with all its difficulties the inquiry is not familiar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to begin with to pray is to expect a miracle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prayer in its very essence says a thoughtful writer implies a belief in the possible intervention of a power which is above nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how was it in my case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was the essence of my belief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing less than this that god would have permitted the laws of nature ordained by his infinite wisdom to fulfil his omniscient designs and pursue their natural course in accordance with his will had not my request persuaded him to suspend those laws in my favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very belief in his omniscience and omnipotence subverts the spirit of such a prayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is on the perfection of god that malebranche bases his argument that dieu nagit pas par des volontes particulieres <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet every prayer affects to interfere with the divine purposes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may here be urged that the divine purposes are beyond our comprehension <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gods purposes may in spite of the inconceivability admit the efficacy of prayer as a link in the chain of causation or as dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mozely holds it may be that a miracle is not an anomaly or irregularity but part of the system of the universe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will not entangle ourselves in the abstruse metaphysical problem which such hypotheses involve but turn for our answer to what we do know to the history of this world to the daily life of man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the sun rises on the evil as well as on the good if the wicked become old yea are mighty in power still the lightning the plague the falling chimneypot smite the good as well as the evil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the dumb animal is not spared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if says huxley our ears were sharp enough to hear all the cries of pain that are uttered in the earth by man and beasts we should be deafened by one continuous scream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there are any marks at all of special design in creation writes john stuart mill one of the things most evidently designed is that a large proportion of all animals should pass their existence in tormenting and devouring other animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have been lavishly fitted out with the instruments for that purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it credible then that the almighty being who as we assume hears this continuous scream animalprayer as we may call it and not only pays no heed to it but lavishly fits out animals with instruments for tormenting and devouring one another that such a being should suspend the laws of gravitation and physiology should perform a miracle equal to that of arresting the sun for all miracles are equipollent simply to prolong the brief and useless existence of such a thing as man of one man out of the myriads who shriek and shriek in vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to pray is to expect a miracle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then comes the further question is this not to expect what never yet has happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only proof of any miracle is the interpretation the witness or witnesses put upon what they have seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> traditional miracles miracles that others have been told that others have seen we need not trouble our heads about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what that proof has been worth hitherto has been commented upon too often to need attention here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor does the weakness of the evidence for miracles depend solely on the fact that it rests in the first instance on the senses which may be deceived or upon inference which may be erroneous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not merely that the infallibility of human testimony discredits the miracles of the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the impossibility that human knowledge that science can ever exhaust the possibilities of nature precludes the immediate reference to the supernatural for all time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is pure sophistry to argue as do canon row and other defenders of miracles that the laws of nature are no more violated by the performance of a miracle than they are by the activities of a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if these arguments of the special pleaders had any force at all it would simply amount to this the activities of man being a part of nature we have no evidence of a supernatural being which is the sole raison detre of miracle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet thousands of men in these days who admit the force of these objections continue in spite of them to pray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huxley the foremost of agnostics speaks with the utmost respect of his friend charles kingsleys conviction from experience of the efficacy of prayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and huxley himself repeatedly assures us in some form or other that the possibilities of may be are to me infinite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the puzzle is in truth on a par with that most insolvable of all puzzles free will or determinism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reason and the instinct of conscience are in both cases irreconcilable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are conscious that we are always free to choose though not to act but reason will have it that this is a delusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no logical clue to the impasse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still reason notwithstanding we take our freedom within limits for granted and with like inconsequence we pray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must i think be admitted that the belief delusive or warranted is efficacious in itself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whether generated in the brain by the nerve centres or whatever may be its origin a force coincident with it is diffused throughout the nervous system which converts the subject of it just paralysed by despair into a vigorous agent or if you will automaton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now those who admit this much argue with no little force that the efficacy of prayer is limited to its reaction upon ourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> prayer as already observed implies belief in supernatural intervention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such belief is competent to beget hope and with it courage energy and effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose contrition and remorse induce the sufferer to pray for divine aid and mercy suppose suffering is the natural penalty of his or her own misdeeds and suppose the contrition and the prayer lead to resistance of similar temptations and hence to greater happiness can it be said that the power to resist temptation or endure the penalty are due to supernatural aid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or must we not infer that the fear of the consequences of vice or folly together with an earnest desire and intention to amend were adequate in themselves to account for the good results <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reason compels us to the latter conclusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would this prove prayer to be delusive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that the laws of nature as argued above are not violated by miracle is a mere perversion of the accepted meaning of miracle an ignoratio elenchi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in the case of prayer that does not ask for the abrogation of natures laws it ceases to be a miracle that we pray for or expect for are not the laws of the mind also laws of nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and can we explain them any more than we can explain physical laws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a psychologist can formulate the mental law of association but he can no more explain it than newton could explain the laws of attraction and repulsion which pervade the world of matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we do not know we cannot know what the conditions of our spiritual being are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the state of mind induced by prayer may in accordance with some mental law be essential to certain modes of spiritual energy specially conducive to the highest of all moral or spiritual results taken in this sense prayer may ask not the suspension but the enactment of some natural law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let it however be granted for arguments sake that the belief in the efficacy of prayer is delusive and that the beneficial effects of the belief the exalted state of mind the enhanced power to endure suffering and resist temptation the happiness inseparable from the assurance that god hears and can and will befriend us let it be granted that all this is due to sheer hallucination is this an argument against prayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for in the first place the incontestable fact that belief does produce these effects is for us an ultimate fact as little capable of explanation as any physical law whatever and may therefore for aught we know or ever can know be ordained by a supreme being <end> <end> 
<start> <start> secondly all the beneficial effects including happiness are as real in themselves as if the belief were no delusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be said that a fools paradise is liable to be turned into a hell of disappointment and that we pay the penalty of building happiness on false foundations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is true in a great measure but it is absolutely without truth as regards our belief in prayer for the simple reason that if death dispel the delusion it at the same time dispels the deluded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however great the mistake it can never be found out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they who make it will have been the better and the happier while they lived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my part though immeasurably preferring the pantheism of goethe or of renan without his pessimism to the anthropomorphic god of the israelites or of their theosophic legatees the christians however inconsistent i still believe in prayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should not pray that i may not die for want of breath nor for rain while the wind was in the wrong quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my prayers would not be like those overheard on his visit to heaven by lucians menippus o jupiter let me become a king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o jupiter let my onions and my garlic thrive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o jupiter let my father soon depart from hence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when the workings of my moral nature were concerned when i needed strength to bear the ills which could not be averted or do what conscience said was right then i should pray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if i had done my best in the same direction i should trust in the unknowable for help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then too is not gratitude to heaven the best of prayers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unhappy he who has never felt it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unhappier still who has never had cause to feel it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be deemed unwarrantable thus to draw the lines between what for want of better terms we call material and spiritual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still reason is but the faculty of a very finite being and as in the enigma of the will utterly incapable of solving any problems beyond those whose data are furnished by the senses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but science demonstratively proves that things are not what they seem their phenomenal existence is nothing else than their relation to our special intelligence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we speak and think as if the discoveries of science were absolutely true true in themselves not relatively so for us only <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet beings with senses entirely different from ours would have an entirely different science <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for them our best established axioms would be inconceivable would have no more science supported by reason assures us that the laws of nature the laws of realistic phenomena are never suspended at the prayers of man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this conclusion the educated world is now rapidly coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if nevertheless men thoroughly convinced of this still choose to believe in the efficacy of prayer reason and science are incompetent to confute them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the belief must be tried elsewhere it must be transferred to the tribunal of conscience or to a metaphysical court in which reason has no jurisdiction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this by no means implies that reason in its own province is to yield to the feeling which so many cite as the we must not be asked to assent to contradictory propositions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must not be asked to believe that injustice cruelty and implacable revenge are not execrable because the bible tells us they were habitually manifested by the tribal god of the israelites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fables of mans fall and of the redemption are fraught with the grossest violation of our moral conscience and will in time be repudiated accordingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is idle to say as the church says these are mysteries above our human reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are fictions fabrications which modern research has traced to their sources and which no unperverted mind would entertain for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fanatical belief in the truth of such dogmas based upon feeling have confronted all who have gone through the severe ordeal of doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a couple of centuries ago those who held them would have burnt alive those who did not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now they have to console themselves with the comforting thought of the fire that shall never be quenched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but even jobs patience could not stand the selfsufficiency of his pious reprovers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sceptic too may retort no doubt but ye are the people and conviction of this kind is but the convenient substitute for knowledge laboriously won for the patient pursuit of truth at all costs a plea in short for ignorance indolence incapacity and the rancorous bigotry begotten of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the distinction is not a purely sentimental one not a belief founded simply on emotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a physical world the world as known to our senses and there is a psychical world the world of feeling consciousness thought and moral life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> granting if it pleases you that material phenomena may be the causes of mental phenomena that la pensee est le produit du corps entier still the two cannot be thought of as one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until it can be proved that there is nothing in the world but matter force and necessity which will never be till we know how we lift our hands to our mouths there remains for us a world of mystery which reason never can invade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a pregnant thought of john mills apropos of material and mental interdependence or identity that the uniform coexistence of one fact with another does not make the one a few words of renans may help to support the argument <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ce qui revele le vrai dieu cest le sentiment moral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> si lhumanite netait quintelligente elle serait athee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> le devoir le devouement le sacrifice toutes choses dont lhistoire est pleine sont inexplicables sans dieu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for all these we need help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it foolishness to pray for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet perhaps not for tout est possible meme whether possible or impossible this much is absolutely certain man must and will have a religion as long as this world lasts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> criticism will change mens dogmas but it will not change mans nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my confidence was restored and with it my powers of endurance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sleep was out of the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was bright and frosty and there was not heat enough in my body to dry my flannel shirt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made shift to pull up some briar bushes and piling them round me as a screen got some little shelter from the light breeze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for hours i lay watching alpha centauri the double star of the great bears pointers dipping under the polar star like the hour hand of a clock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my thoughts strange to say ran little on the morrow they dwelt almost solely upon william nelson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how far was i responsible to what extent to blame for leading him against his will to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he was in my hands still breathing when i let him go knowing as i did so that the deed consigned him living to his grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this way i passed the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as the first streaks of the longedfor dawn broke in the east i heard distant cries which sounded like the whoops of indians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they ceased but presently began again much nearer than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no mistake about them now they were the yappings of a pack of wolves clearly enough upon our track of yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few minutes more and the light though still dim revealed their presence coming on at full gallop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain i sought for stick or stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the river though i took to it would not save me if they meant mischief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they saw me they slackened their pace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they then halted and forming a halfmoon some thirty yards off squatted on their haunches and began at intervals to throw up their heads and howl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my chief hope was in the coming daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were less likely to attack a man then than in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had often met one or two together when hunting these had always bolted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i had never seen a pack before and i knew a pack meant that they were after food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i kept still they got up advanced a yard or two then repeated their former game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every minute the light grew stronger its warmer tints heralded the rising sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing however that my passivity encouraged them and convinced that a single step in retreat would bring the pack upon me i determined in a moment of inspiration to run amuck and trust to providence for the consequences <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flinging my arms wildly into the air and frantically yelling with all my lungs i dashed straight in for the lot of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were as i expected taken by surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they jumped to their feet and turned tail but again stopped this time farther off and howled with vexation at having to wait till their prey succumbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouted to him and he to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finding me thus reinforced the enemy slunk off and i was not sorry to see the last of my ugly foes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i now repeated my instructions about our trysting place waited patiently till samson had breakfasted which he did with the most exasperating deliberation saw him saddle my horse and leave his camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then started upon my travels up the river to meet him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a mile or so the high ground on both banks obliged us to make some little detour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we then lost sight of each other nor was he to be seen when i reached the appointed spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long before i did so i began to feel the effects of my labours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my naked feet were in a terrible state from the cactus thorns which i had been unable to avoid in the dark occasional stones too had bruised and made them very tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unable to shuffle on at more than two miles an hour at fastest the happy thought occurred to me of tearing up my shirt and binding a half round each foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this enabled me to get on much better but when the september sun was high my unprotected skin and head paid the penalty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i waited for a couple of hours i dare say hoping samson would appear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but concluding at length that he had arrived long before me through the slowness of my early progress and had gone further up the river thinking perhaps that i had meant some other place i gave him up and full of internal dn at his incorrigible consistency plodded on and on for i knew not where <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why it may be asked did i not try to cross where i had intended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must confess my want of courage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> true the river here was not half not a third of the width of the scene of my disasters but i was weak in body and in mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had anything human been on the other side to see me to see how brave i was alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could have plucked up heart to risk it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have been such a comfort to have some one to see me drown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is difficult to play the hero with no spectators save oneself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall always have a fellowfeeling with the last man practically my position was about as uncomfortable as his will be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the worst features of it was what we so often suffered from before the inaccessibility of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was broiling and the and soil reflected its scorching rays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was feverish from exhaustion and there was nothing nothing to look forward to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mile after mile i crawled along sometimes half disposed to turn back and try the deep but narrow passage then that inexhaustible fountain of last hopes the unknown tempted me to go forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i passed a rock an indian stood before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as naked as i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> over his shoulder he carried a spear as long as a salmon rod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though neither had foreseen the other he was absolutely unmoved showed no surprise no curiosity no concern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood still and let me come up to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my only or rather my uppermost feeling was gladness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course the thought crossed me of what he might do if he owed the white skins a grudge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any white man had ever harmed one of his tribe i was at his mercy and it was certain that he would show me none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a tall powerful man and in my then condition he could have done what he pleased with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> friday was my model the red man was robinson crusoe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i kneeled at his feet and touched the ground with my forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not seem the least elated by my humility there was not a spark of vanity in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed except for its hideousness and brutality his face was without expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i now proceeded to make a drawing with my finger in the sand of a mule in the water while i imitated by pantomime the struggles of the drowning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then pointed to myself and using my arms as in swimming shook my head and my finger to signify that i could not swim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i worked an imaginary paddle and made him understand that i wanted him to paddle me across the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still he remained unmoved till finally i used one argument which interested him more than all the rest of my story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i untied a part of the shirt round one foot and showed him three gold studs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these i took out and gave to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i also made a drawing of a rifle in the sand and signified that he would get the like if he went with me to my camp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon he turned in the direction i was going and though unbidden by a look i did not hesitate to follow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought i must have dropped before we reached his village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was an osierbed at the waters side where the whole river rushed through a rocky gorge not more than fifty to sixty yards broad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were perhaps nearly a hundred indians here twothirds of whom were women and children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their habitations were formed by interlacing the tops of the osiers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dogs skins spread upon the ground and numerous salmon spears were their only furniture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few minutes my arrival created a prodigious commotion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole population turned out to stare at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children ran into the bushes to hide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but feminine curiosity conquered feminine timidity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although i was in the plight of the forlorn odysseus after his desperate swim i had no blooming foliage to wind greek text which cannot be reproduced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unlike the phaeacian maidens however the tawny nymphs were all as brave as princess nausicaa herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stared and pointed and buzzed and giggled and even touched my skin with the tips of their fingers to see i suppose if the white would come off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ravenous hunger turned up its nose at flirtation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fillets of drying salmon suspended from every bough were a million times more seductive than the dark naiads who had dressed them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slice after slice i tore down and devoured as though my maw were as compendious as jack the giant killers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this so astonished and delighted the young women that they kept supplying me with the expectation perhaps that sooner or later i must share the giants fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while this was going on a conference was being held and i had the satisfaction of seeing some men pull up a lot of dead rushes dexterously tie them into bundles and truss these together by means of spears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had no canoes for the very children were amphibious living so it seemed as much in the water as out of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the raft was completed i was invited to embark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my original friend who had twisted a towrope took this between his teeth and led the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> others swam behind and beside me to push and to pull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the force of the water was terrific but they seemed to care no more for that than fish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my weight sunk the rush bundles a good bit below the surface and to try my nerves my crew every now and then with a wild yell dived simultaneously dragging the raft and me under water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i sat tight and with genuine friendliness they landed me safely on the desired shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite dark before we set forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robinson crusoe walked on as if he knew exactly where my camp was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> probably the whole catastrophe had by this time been bruited for miles above and below the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> five other stalwart young fellows kept us company each with salmon spear in hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the walk seemed interminable but i had shipped a goodly cargo of latent energy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i got home instead of samson i found the camp occupied by half a dozen indians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were squatted round a fire smoking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each one so it seemed had appropriated some article of our goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our blankets were over their shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one had williams long rifle in his lap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few words were exchanged with the newcomers who seated themselves beside their friends but no more notice was taken of me than of the mules which were eating rushes close to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how was i singlehanded to regain possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a diplomatic course commanded itself as the only possible one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were six men who expected rewards but the wherewithal was held in seisin by other six <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fight if there were one should be between the two parties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would hope to prove that when thieves fall out honest men come by their own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is one adage whose truth i needed no further proof of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its first line apostrophises the gods and little fishes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my chief need was for the garment which completes the rhyme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indians having no use for corduroy small clothes i speedily donned mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next i quietly but quickly snatched up williams rifle and presented it to robinson crusoe patting him on the back as if with honours of knighthood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dispossessed was not well pleased but sir robinson was and to all appearances he was a man of leading if of darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while words were passing between the two i sauntered round to the gentleman who sat crosslegged upon my weapon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as heedless of me as i outwardly of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when well within reach mindful that de laudace is no bad motto in love and war i suddenly placed my foot upon his chest tightened the extensor muscle of my leg and sent him heels over head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant the rifle was mine and both barrels cocked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after yesterdays immersion it might not have gone off but the offended indian though furious doubtless inferred from the histrionic attitude which i at once struck that i felt confident it would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with my rifle in hand with my suite looking to me to transfer the plunder to them my position was now secure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put on a shirt the only one left to me by the way my shoes and stockings and my shooting coat and picking out williams effects divided these with his ammunition his carpetbag and his blankets amongst my original friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was beginning to gather my own things together when samson leading my horse unexpectedly rode into the midst of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the indians took their leave and added to the obligation by bequeathing us a large fresh salmon which served us for many a day to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a postscript i may add that i found poor marys address on one of her letters and faithfully kept my promise as soon as i reached pen and ink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what remains to be told will not take long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hardships naturally increased as the means of bearing them diminished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have said the salmon held out for many days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cut it in strips and dried it as well as we could but the flies and maggots robbed us of a large portion of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length we were reduced to two small hams nothing else except a little tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> guessing the distance we had yet to go and taking into account our slow rate of travelling i calculated the number of days which with the greatest economy these could be made to last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allowing only one meal a day and that of the scantiest i scored the hams as a cook scores a leg of roast pork determined under no circumstances to exceed the daily ration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no little discipline was requisite to adhere to this resolution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson broke down under the exposure and privation superadded dysentery rendered him all but helpless and even affected his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole labour of the camp then devolved on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never roused him in the morning till the mules were packed with all but his blanket and the pannikin for his tea and until i had saddled his horse for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not till we halted at night did we get our ration of ham <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this he ate or rather bolted raw like a wild beast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my share i never touched till after i lay down to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so tired have i been that once or twice i woke in the morning with my hand at my mouth the unswallowed morsel between my teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for three weeks we went on in this way never exchanging a word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot say how i might have behaved had fred been in samsons place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope i should have been at least humane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was labouring for my life and was not over tenderhearted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly there was enough to try the patience of a better man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unable one morning to find my own horse i saddled his and started him off so as not to waste time with his spare animal and the three mules <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it so happened that our line of march was rather tortuous owing to some hills we had to round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still as there were high mountains in the distance which we were making for it seemed impossible that anyone could miss his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was twenty minutes perhaps before i found my horse this would give him about a mile or more start of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hurried on but failed to overtake him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the end of an hour i rode to the top of a hill which commanded a view of the course he should have taken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a moving speck was to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew then that he had gone astray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the provisions and blankets were with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think that at any point of my journey i had ever felt fear panic that is till now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> starvation stared me in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my wits refused to suggest a line of action <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt then what i have often felt since what i still feel that it is possible to wrestle successfully with every difficulty that man has overcome but not with that supreme difficulty mans stupidity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did not then occur to me to give a name to the impatience that seeks to gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned back retraced my steps till i came to the track of the mules <end> <end> 
<start> <start> luckily the ground retained the footprints though sometimes these would be lost for a hundred yards or so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as i anticipated samson had wound round the base of the very first hill he came to then instead of correcting the deviation and steering for the mountains had simply followed his nose and was now travelling due east in other words was going back over our track of the day before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was past noon when i overtook him so that a precious days labour was lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said little but that little was a sentence of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first he seemed hardly to take in my meaning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as well as i can make out before we get to the dalles where we ought to find the american outposts we have only about miles to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this should not take more than eight or nine days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can do it in a week alone but not with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have come to the conclusion that with you i may not be able to do it at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have still those mountains pointing to the blue mountain range in the distance to cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are covered with snow as you see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in any case our food will only last eight or nine days more even at the present rate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you shall have the largest half of what is left for you require more than i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i cannot and will not sacrifice my life for your sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it must always be a terrible thing for a judge to pass the sentence of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but then he is fulfilling a duty merely carrying out a law which is not of his making <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover he has no option the responsibility rests with the jury last of all the sufferer is a criminal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between the judges case and mine there was no analogy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my act was a purely selfish one justifiable i still think though certainly not magnanimous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was quite aware of this at the time but a starving man is not burdened with generosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dismounted and without unsaddling the mules took off their packs now reduced to a few pounds which was all the wretched rawbacked and halfdead animals could stagger under and putting my blanket the remains of a ham and a little packet of tea some eight or ten teaspoonfuls on one mule i again prepared to mount my horse and depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took as it were a sneaking glance at samson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was sitting upon the ground with his face between his knees sobbing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at threeandtwenty the heart of a man or of a woman if either has any which of course may be doubtful is apt to play the dynamite with his or her resolves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> waterdrops have ever been formidable weapons of the latter as we all know and not being so accustomed to them then as i have become since the sight of the poor devils abject woe and destitution the thought that illness and suffering were the causes the secret whisper that my act was a cowardly one forced me to follow the lines of least resistance and submit to the decrees of destiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one more page from my ride and the reader will i think have a fair conception of its general character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the last two hours the ascent of the blue mountains had been very steep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in a thick pine forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a track probably made by indians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the summit we found a spring of beautiful water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here we halted for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing for the animals to eat except pine needles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we lighted our fire against the great uptorn roots of a fallen tree and though it was freezing hard we piled on such masses of dead boughs that the huge blaze seemed to warm the surrounding atmosphere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must here give the words of my journal for one exclamation in it has a sort of schoolboy ring that recalls the buoyancy of youthful spirits the spirits indeed to which in early as i was dozing off a pack of hungry wolves that had scented us out set up the most infernal chorus ever heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain i pulled the frozen buffalorobe over my head and tried to get to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the demons drew nearer and nearer howling snarling fighting moaning and making a row in the perfect stillness which reigned around as if hell itself were loose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some time i bore it with patience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length jumping up i yelled in a voice that made the valley ring you devils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the appeal was immediately answered by silence but hearing them tuning up for a second concert i threw some wood on the blazing fire and once more retired to my lair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a few minutes i lay awake to admire a brilliant aurora borealis shooting out its streams of electric light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then turning over on my side i the first objects that caught my eye were the animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were huddled together within a couple of yards of where we lay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two out of the three mules and samsons horse had been attacked by the wolves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the flanks of the horse were terribly torn and the entrails of both the mules were partially hanging out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though all three were still standing with their backs arched they were rapidly dying from loss of blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear little strawberry as we called him to match williams cream and my mare were both intact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few days after this samsons remaining horse gave out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to surrender what remained of my poor beast in order to get my companion through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the last fifty miles of the journey i performed on foot sometimes carrying my rifle to relieve the staggering little mule of a few pounds extra weight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at long last the dalles hove in sight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where is the tent of the commanding officer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked of the first soldier i came across <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pointed to one on the hillside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ags for major dooker was the dutchaccented answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bidding samson stay where he was i made my way as directed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a middleaged officer in undress uniform was sitting on an empty packingcase in front of his tent whittling a piece of its wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray sir said i in my best louis quatorze manner have i let me describe what the major saw a man wasted by starvation to skin and bone blackened almost by months of exposure to scorching suns clad in the shreds of what had once been a shirt torn by every kind of convict labour stained by mud and the sweat and sores of mules the rags of a shooting coat to match no head covering hands festering with sores and which for weeks had not touched water if they could avoid it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such an object in short as the genius of a phil may could alone have depicted as the most repulsive object he could imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am quite tame sir i assure you could even eat out of yes was my amazed reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then come with me i will show you something that may i followed him to a neighbouring tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew aside the flap of it and there on his blanket lay fred calthorpe snoring in perfect bliss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our greetings were less restrained than our parting had been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were truly glad to meet again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had arrived just two days before me although he had been at salt lake city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had been able there to refit had obtained ample supplies and fresh animals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> curiously enough his nelson the frenchcanadian had also been drowned in crossing the snake river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his place however had been filled by another man and jacob had turned out a treasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the good fellow greeted me warmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it was no slight compensation for bygone troubles to be assured by him that our separation had led to the final triumphal success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred and i now shared the same tent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to show what habit will do it was many days before i could accustom myself to sleep under cover of a tent even and in preference slept as i had done for five months under the stars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the officers liberally furnished us with clothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but their excessive hospitality more nearly proved fatal to me than any peril i had met with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ones stomach had quite lost its discretion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> famished people must be slowly nursed one never knew when to leave off eating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a few days i was seriously ill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an absurd incident occurred to me here which might have had an unpleasant ending <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every evening after dinner in the mess tent we played whist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one night quite by accident fred and i happened to be partners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the major and another officer made up the four <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we two had had an extraordinary run of luck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the majors temper had been smouldering for some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the deal fell to me and as bad luck would have it i dealt myself a handful of trumps and all four honours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the last of these was played the now blazing major dashed his cards on the table and there and then called me out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cooler heads of two or three of the others with whom fred had had time to make friends to say nothing of the usual roar of laughter with which he himself heard the challenge brought the matter to a peaceful issue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the following day one of the officers brought me a graceful apology <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as may readily be supposed we had no hankering for further travels such as we had gone through <end> <end> 
<start> <start> san francisco was our destination but though as unknown to us as charles lambs stranger we damned the overland route at a venture and settled as there was no alternative to go in a trading ship to the sandwich islands thence by the same means to california <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on october we procured a canoe large enough for seven or eight persons and embarking with our light baggage fred samson and i took leave of the dalles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some miles the great river the columbia runs through the cascade mountains and is confined as heretofore in a channel of basaltic rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> further down it widens and is ornamented by groups of small wooded islands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one of these we landed to rest our indians and feed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards evening we again put ashore at an indian village where we camped for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it reminded me a little of the danube below linz or of the finest parts of the elbe in saxon switzerland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this is to compare the fulllength portrait with the miniature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is the grandeur of the scale of the best of the american scenery that so strikes the european <end> <end> 
<start> <start> variety however has its charms and before one has travelled fifteen hundred miles on the same river as one may easily do in america one begins to sigh for the rhine or even for a trip from london to greenwich with a whitebait dinner at the end of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day after we descended the cascades <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they are the beginning of an immense fall in the level and form a succession of rapids nearly two miles long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the excitement of this passage is rather too great for pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is like being run away with by a motor down a steep hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bow of the canoe is often several feet below the stern as if about to take a header <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water in glassy ridges and dark furrows rushes headlong and dashes itself madly against the reefs which crop up everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no time one thinks to choose a course even if steerage which seems absurd were possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one is hurled along at railway speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the upreared rock that a moment ago seemed a hundred yards off is now under the very bow of the canoe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one clenches ones teeth holds ones breath ones hour is surely come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no a shout from the indians a magic stroke of the paddle in the bow another in the stern and the dreaded crag is far above out heads far far behind and for the moment we are gliding on undrowned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the lower end of the rapids our indians refusing to go further we had to debark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a settler here was putting up a zinc house for a store <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two others with an officer of the mounted rifles the regiment we had left at the dalles were staying with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they welcomed our arrival and insisted on our drinking half a dozen of poisonous stuff they called champagne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no chairs or table in the house nor as yet any floor and only the beginning of a roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we sat on the ground so that i was able surreptitiously to make libations with my share to the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> according to my journal in a short time the party began to be a noisy one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> healths were drunk toasts proposed compliments to our respective nationalities paid in the most flattering terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the anglosaxon race were destined to conquer the globe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the english were the greatest nation under the sun that is to say they had been <end> <end> 
<start> <start> america of course would take the lead in time to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the americans were certain of it in fact this was already an accomplished fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the big officer a genuine heavy wanted to know where the man was that would give him the lie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wasnt the mounted rifles the crack regiment of the united states army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and wasnt the united states army the finest army in the universe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who that knew anything of history would compare the peninsular campaign to the war in mexico <end> <end> 
<start> <start> talk of waterloo britishers were mighty fond of swaggering about waterloo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for wellington he couldnt shine nohow with general scott then we wished for a war just to let them see what our crack cavalry regiments could do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whose trade it was to sell nutmegs made of wood and clocks that wouldnt figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then some pretty forcible profanity was vented fists were shaken and the zinc walls were struck till they resounded like the threatened thunder of artillery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but freds merry laughter diverted the tragic end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was agreed that there had been too much tall talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> britishers and americans were not such fools as to quarrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let everybody drink everybody elses health <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gentleman in the corner he needed the support of both walls thought it wasnt good to liquor up too much on an empty stomach he put it to the house that we should have supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and a dutch cheese was produced with much eclat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson coupled the ideas of dutch cheeses and yankee hospitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this revived the flagging spirit of emulation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on one side it was thought that british manners were susceptible of amendment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> confusion was then respectively drunk to yankee hospitality english manners and this was an addition of freds to dutch cheeses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after which to change the subject a song was called for and a gentleman who shall be nameless for there was a little mischief in the choice sang rule britannia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not being encored the singer drank to the flag that had braved the battle and the breeze for nearly ninety years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres to uncle sam and his stars and stripes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mounted officer rose to his legs with difficulty and declared that he could not and would not hear his country insulted any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he begged to challenge the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he regretted the necessity but his feelings had been wounded and he could not no he positively could not stand it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a slight push from samson proved the fact the speaker fell to rise no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the company soon followed his example and shortly afterwards there was no sound but that of the adjacent rapids <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early next morning the settlers boat came up and took us a mile down the river where we found a larger one to convey us to fort vancouver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crew were a maltese sailor and a man who had been in the united states army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each had his private opinions as to her management <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally the maltese should have been captain but the soldier was both supercargo and part owner and though it was blowing hard and the sails were fully large the foreigner who was but a poor little creature had to obey orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the river widened and grew rougher we were wetted from stem to stern at every plunge and when it became evident that the soldier could not handle the sails if the maltese was kept at the helm the heavy rifleman who was on board declaring that he knew the river took upon himself to steer us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few minutes the boat was nearly swamped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the maltese prayed and blasphemed in language which no one understood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the oaths of the soldier were intelligible enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heavy now alarmed nervously asked what had better be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my advice was to grease the bowsprit let go the mast and splice the main brace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in another minute or fred who thought it no time for joking called the rifleman a damned fool and authoritatively bade him give up the tiller saying that i had been in her majestys navy and perhaps knew a little more about boats than he did <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this the other replied that he didnt want anyone to learn him he reckond hed been raised to boating as well as the next man and hed be derned if he was going to trust his life to anybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson thinking no doubt of his own took his pipe out of his mouth and towering over the steersman flung him like a child on one side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant i was in his place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a minute or two before the boat had way enough to answer the helm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by that time we were within a dozen yards of a reef <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having noticed however that the little craft was quick in her stays i kept her full till the last put the helm down and round she spun in a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before i could thank my stars the pintle or hook on which the rudder hangs broke off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tiller was knocked out of my hand and the boats head flew into the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out with the sweeps i shouted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the sweeps were under the gear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two men cursed in the names of their respective saints <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heavy whined i told you how it wd be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> samson struggled valiantly to get at an oar while fred setting the example begged all hands to be calm and be ready to fend the stern off the rocks with a boathook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we drifted into the surf i was wondering how many bumps she would stand before she went to pieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> happily the water shallowed and the men by jumping overboard managed to drag the boat through the breakers under the lee of the point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we afterwards drew her up on to the beach kindled a fire got out some provisions and stayed till the storm was over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was then called fort vancouver was a station of the hudsons bay company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we took up our quarters here till one of the companys vessels the mary dare a brig of tons was ready to sail for the sandwich islands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was about the most uncomfortable trip i ever made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sailing merchant brig of tons deeply laden is not exactly a pleasure yacht and miles is a long voyage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for ten days we lay at anchor at the mouth of the columbia detained by westerly gales <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a week after we put to sea all our fresh provisions were consumed and we had to live on our cargo dried salmon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we three and the captain more than filled the little hole of a cabin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there wasnt even a hammock and we had to sleep on the deck or on the lockers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fleas the cockroaches and the rats romped over and under one all night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not counting the time it took to go down the river or the ten days we were kept at its mouth we were just six weeks at sea before we reached woahoo on christmas day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how beautiful the islands looked as we passed between them with a fair wind and studding sails set alow and aloft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their tropical charms seemed more glowing the water bluer the palm trees statelier the vegetation more libertine than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the south the land rises gradually from the shore to a range of lofty mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> immediately behind honolulu the capital a valley with a road winding up it leads to the north side of the island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this valley is or was then richly cultivated principally with taro a large root not unlike the yam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there native huts were dotted about with gardens full of flowers and abundance of tropical fruit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> higher up where it becomes too steep for cultivation growth of all kind is rampant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> acacias oranges maples breadfruit and sandalwood trees rear their heads above the tangled evergreens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the high peaks constantly in the clouds arrest the moisture of the ocean atmosphere and countless rills pour down the mountain sides clothing everything in perpetual verdure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the climate is one of the least changeable in the world the sea breeze blows day and night and throughout the year the day temperature does not vary more than five or six degrees the average being about eightythree degrees fahrenheit in the shade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the town of honolulu was little else than a native village of grass and mat huts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two or three merchants had good houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in one of these fred and samson were domiciled there was no such thing as a hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was the guest of general miller the consulgeneral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what changes may have taken place since the above date i have no means of knowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far as the natives go the change will assuredly have been for the worse for the aborigines in all parts of the world lose their primitive simplicity and soon acquire the worst vices of civilisation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was not innocent of one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> general miller offered to present us at court but he had to give several days notice in order that his majesty might be sufficiently sober to receive us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a negro tailor from the united states fitted us out with suits of black and on the appointed day we put ourselves under the shade of the old generals cocked hat and marched in a body to the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a native band in which a big drum had the leading part received us with god save the queen whether in honour of king tamy or of his visitors was not divulged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were first introduced to a number of chiefs in european uniforms except as to their feet which were mostly bootless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their names sounded like those of the state officers in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i find in my journal one entered as toveytovey another as kanakala <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were then conducted to the presence chamber by the foreign minister mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wiley a very pronounced scotch gentleman with a star of the first magnitude on his breast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king was dressed as an english admiral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queen whose ample undulations also reminded one of the high seas was on his right while in perfect gradation on her right again were four princesses in short frocks and long trousers with plaited tails tied with blue ribbon like the miss kenwigs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little side dispute arose between the stiff old general and the foreign minister as to whose right it was to present us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the consul carried the day but the scot not to be beaten informed tamehameha in a long prefatory oration of the object of the ceremony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> taking one of us by the hand i thought the peppery old general would have thrust him aside mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wiley told the king that it was seldom the sandwich islands were veesited by strangers of such desteenction that the duke of this referring to freds relations and lord the other were the greatest noblemen in the world then with much solemnity quoted a long speech from shakespeare and handed us over to his rival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his majesty who did not understand a word of english or scotch looked grave and held tight to the arm of the throne for the truth is that although he had relinquished his bottle for the hour he had brought its contents with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my salaam was soon made but as i retired backwards i had the misfortune to set my heel on the toes of a blackandtan terrier a privileged pet of the generals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll have the laugh on him so that theyll vote two apiece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll never forget his barn party or us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyll always remember us as were dancing together now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called as they whirled past the fiddlers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the musicians grinned looked at each other hesitated and began a new air and nils sang with them as the couples fell from when other lips and other hearts their tale of love shall tell in language whose excess imparts the power they feel so well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a gay one he is that nils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> svendsens cap lurched dreamily from side to side to the flowing measure of the dance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of days that have as haappy been and youll remember me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moonlight flooded that great silent land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reaped fields lay yellow in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the straw stacks and poplar windbreaks threw sharp black shadows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the roads were white rivers of dust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sky was a deep crystalline blue and the stars were few and faint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything seemed to have succumbed to have sunk to sleep under the great golden tender midsummer moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the splendour of it seemed to transcend human life and human fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the senses were too feeble to take it in and every time one looked up at the sky one felt unequal to it as if one were sitting deaf under the waves of a great river of melody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the road nils ericson was lying against a straw stack in olafs wheat field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his own life seemed strange and unfamiliar to him as if it were something he had read about or dreamed and forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lay very still watching the white road that ran in front of him lost itself among the fields and then at a distance reappeared over a little hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last against this white band he saw something moving rapidly and he got up and walked to the edge of the field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is passing the row of poplars now he thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard the padded beat of hoofs along the dusty road and as she came into sight he stepped out and waved his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then for fear of frightening the horse he drew back and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara had seen him and she came up at a walk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nils took the horse by the bit and stroked his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what are you doing out so late clara vavrika <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went to the house but johanna told me you had gone to your fathers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who can stay in the house on a night like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nils turned the horse into the field <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not far but i want to talk to you tonight i have something to say to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant talk to you at the house with olaf sitting there on the porch weighing a thousand tons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wont be sitting there now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes in bed by this time and asleepweighing a thousand tons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nils plodded on across the stubble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you really going to spend the rest of your life like this night after night summer after summer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> havent you anything better to do on a night like this than to wear yourself and norman out tearing across the country to your fathers and back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides your father wont live forever you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his little place will be shut up or sold and then youll have nobody but the ericsons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have to fasten down the hatches for the winter then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i try never to think of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i lost father id lose everything even my hold over the ericsons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd lose a good deal more than that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd lose your race everything that makes you yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve lost a good deal of it now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of your love of life your capacity for delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara put her hands up to her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent nils ericson i havent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say anything to me but that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nils led the horse up to a straw stack and turned to clara looking at her intently as he had looked at her that sunday afternoon at vavrikas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but why do you fight for that so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what good is the power to enjoy if you never enjoy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your hands are cold again what are you afraid of all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah youre afraid of losing it thats whats the matter with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you will clara vavrika you will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i used to know youlisten youve caught a wild bird in your hand havent you and felt its heart beat so hard that you were afraid it would shatter its little body to pieces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you used to be just like that a slender eager thing with a wild delight inside you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is how i remembered you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i come back and find youa bitter woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a perfect ferret fight here you live by biting and being bitten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you remember what life used to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you remember that old delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never forgotten it or known its like on land or sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew the horse under the shadow of the straw stack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara felt him take her foot out of the stirrup and she slid softly down into his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a deliberate man but his nerves were steel when he wanted anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something flashed out from him like a knife out of a sheath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara felt everything slipping away from her she was flooded by the summer night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thrust his hand into his pocket and then held it out at arms length <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shadow of the straw stack fell sharp across his wrist and in the palm of his hand she saw a silver dollar shining <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats my pile he muttered will you go with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara nodded and dropped her forehead on his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you go with me tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to town to catch the midnight flyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara lifted her head and pulled herself together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we couldnt go away like that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the only way we ever will go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant sit on the bank and think about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the way ive always done and its the right way for people like you and me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres nothing so dangerous as sitting still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve only got one life one youth and you can let it slip through your fingers if you want to nothing easier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd be better off tramping the roads with me than you are here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nils held back her head and looked into her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im not that kind of a tramp clara <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you wont have to take in sewing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im with a norwegian shipping line came over on business with the new york offices but now im going straight back to bergen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i expect ive got as much money as the ericsons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father sent me a little to get started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there i hadnt meant to tell you i wanted you to come on your own nerve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara looked off across the fields <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt that nils but something seems to hold me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid to pull against it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it comes out of the ground i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your father will understand hes made like us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for olaf johanna will take better care of him than ever you could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its now or never clara vavrika <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my bags at the station i smuggled it there yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara clung to him and hid her face against his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit here and talk to me tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to go anywhere tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may never love you like this again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant come that on me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats not my way clara vavrika <end> <end> 
<start> <start> erics mare is over there behind the stacks and im off on the midnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its goodbye or off across the world with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive written a letter to olaf ill mail it in town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he reads it he wont bother usnot if i know him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides i could demand an investigation of his administration of cousin henriks estate and that would be bad for a public man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve no clothes i know but you can sit up tonight and we can get everything on the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wheres your old dash clara vavrika <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats become of your bohemian blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to think you had courage enough for anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wheres your nervewhat are you waiting for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara drew back her head and he saw the slumberous fire in her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for you to say one thing nils ericson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never say that thing to any woman clara vavrika <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaned back lifted her gently from the ground and whispered through his teeth but ill never never let you go not to any man on earth but me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara sank down on a sheaf of wheat and covered her face with her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not know what she was going to do whether she would go or stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great silent country seemed to lay a spell upon her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ground seemed to hold her as if by roots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her knees were soft under her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt as if she could not bear separation from her old sorrows from her old discontent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were dear to her they had kept her alive they were a part of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there would be nothing left of her if she were wrenched away from them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never could she pass beyond that skyline against which her restlessness had beat so many times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt as if her soul had built itself a nest there on that horizon at which she looked every morning and every evening and it was dear to her inexpressibly dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she pressed her fingers against her eyeballs to shut it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside her she heard the tramping of horses in the soft earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put his hands under her arms and lifted her lightly to her saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he swung himself into his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall have to ride fast to catch the midnight train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a start a thud of hoofs along the moonlit road two dark shadows going over the hill and then the great still land stretched untroubled under the azure night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a year after the flight of olaf ericsons wife the night train was steaming across the plains of iowa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conductor was hurrying through one of the day coaches his lantern on his arm when a lank fairhaired boy sat up in one of the plush seats and tweaked him by the coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the next stop please sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you go through to chicago dont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked down and noticed that the boys eyes were red and his face was drawn as if he were in trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i was wondering whether i could get off at the next place and get a train back to omaha <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the western part of the state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how soon do we get to red oak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youd better make up your mind so i can tell the baggageman to put your trunk off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i mean i havent got any the boy added blushing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> run away the conductor thought as he slammed the coach door behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eric ericson crumpled down in his seat and put his brown hand to his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been crying and he had had no supper and his head was aching violently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thought as he looked dully down at his big shoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nils will be ashamed of me i havent got any spunk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever since nils had run away with his brothers wife life at home had been hard for little eric <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother and olaf both suspected him of complicity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ericson was harsh and faultfinding constantly wounding the boys pride and olaf was always setting her against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> joe vavrika heard often from his daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara had always been fond of her father and happiness made her kinder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wrote him long accounts of the voyage to bergen and of the trip she and nils took through bohemia to the little town where her father had grown up and where she herself was born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she visited all her kinsmen there and sent her father news of his brother who was a priest of his sister who had married a horsebreederof their big farm and their many children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these letters joe always managed to read to little eric <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they contained messages for eric and hilda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clara sent presents too which eric never dared to take home and which poor little hilda never even saw though she loved to hear eric tell about them when they were out getting the eggs together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but olaf once saw eric coming out of vavrikas house the old man had never asked the boy to come into his saloonand olaf went straight to his mother and told her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ericson came to erics room after he was in bed and made a terrible scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could be very terrifying when she was really angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she forbade him ever to speak to vavrika again and after that night she would not allow him to go to town alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so it was a long while before eric got any more news of his brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but old joe suspected what was going on and he carried claras letters about in his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one sunday he drove out to see a german friend of his and chanced to catch sight of eric sitting by the cattle pond in the big pasture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went together into fritz oberlies barn and read the letters and talked things over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eric admitted that things were getting hard for him at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that very night old joe sat down and laboriously penned a statement of the case to his daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> things got no better for eric <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother and olaf felt that however closely he was watched he still as they said heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had sent johanna vavrika packing back to her brothers though olaf would much rather have kept her than anders eldest daughter whom mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not so highhanded as his mother and he once sulkily told her that she might better have taught her granddaughter to cook before she sent johanna away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> olaf could have borne a good deal for the sake of prunes spiced in honey the secret of which johanna had taken away with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last two letters came to joe vavrika one from nils enclosing a postal order for money to pay erics passage to bergen and one from clara saying that nils had a place for eric in the offices of his company that he was to live with them and that they were only waiting for him to come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was to leave new york on one of the boats of nils own line the captain was one of their friends and eric was to make himself known at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nils directions were so explicit that a baby could have followed them eric felt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here he was nearing red oak iowa and rocking backward and forward in despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had he loved his brother so much and never had the big world called to him so hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there was a lump in his throat which would not go down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ever since nightfall he had been tormented by the thought of his mother alone in that big house that had sent forth so many men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her unkindness now seemed so little and her loneliness so great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remembered everything she had ever done for him how frightened she had been when he tore his hand in the cornsheller and how she wouldnt let olaf scold him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when nils went away he didnt leave his mother all alone or he would never have gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conductor came in smiling not unkindly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well young man what are you going to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we stop at red oak in three minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conductor went out and the boy doubled up with misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he couldnt let his one chance go like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt for his breast pocket and crackled nils letter to give him courage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he didnt want nils to be ashamed of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he remembered his brothers kind twinkling eyes that always looked at you as if from far away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lump in his throat softened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah but nils nils would iunderstandi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats just it about nils he always understands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a lank pale boy with a canvas telescope stumbled off the train to the red oak siding just as the conductor called all aboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ericson was sitting alone in her wooden rockingchair on the front porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> little hilda had been sent to bed and had cried herself to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old womans knitting was on her lap but her hands lay motionless on top of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for more than an hour she had not moved a muscle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she simply sat as only the ericsons and the mountains can sit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house was dark and there was no sound but the croaking of the frogs down in the pond of the little pasture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eric did not come home by the road but across the fields where no one could see him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he set his telescope down softly in the kitchen shed and slipped noiselessly along the path to the front porch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sat down on the step without saying anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ericson made no sign and the frogs croaked on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last the boy spoke timidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eric leaned over and picked up a little stick out of the grass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can milk as good as any of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eric slid along the step nearer to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why didnt you get one of ottos boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt want anybody to know i was in need of a boy said mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked straight in front of her and her mouth tightened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always meant to give you the home farm she added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy stared and slid closer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh mother he faltered i dont care about the farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came back because i thought you might be needing me maybe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hung his head and got no further <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her hand went out from her suddenly and rested on his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her fingers twined themselves in his soft pale hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tears splashed down on the boards happiness filled his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the train neared tarrytown imogen willard began to wonder why she had consented to be one of flavias house party at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not felt enthusiastic about it since leaving the city and was experiencing a prolonged ebb of purpose a current of chilling indecision under which she vainly sought for the motive which had induced her to accept flavias invitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it was a vague curiosity to see flavias husband who had been the magician of her childhood and the hero of innumerable arabian fairy tales <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it was a desire to see m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roux whom flavia had announced as the especial attraction of the occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it was a wish to study that remarkable woman in her own setting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen admitted a mild curiosity concerning flavia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was in the habit of taking people rather seriously but somehow found it impossible to take flavia so because of the very vehemence and insistence with which flavia demanded it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> submerged in her studies imogen had of late years seen very little of flavia but flavia in her hurried visits to new york between her excursions from studio to studioher luncheons with this lady who had to play at a matinee and her dinners with that singer who had an evening concerthad seen enough of her friends handsome daughter to conceive for her an inclination of such violence and assurance as only flavia could afford <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fact that imogen had shown rather marked capacity in certain esoteric lines of scholarship and had decided to specialize in a well sounding branch of philology at the ecole des chartes had fairly placed her in that category of interesting people whom flavia considered her natural affinities and lawful prey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when imogen stepped upon the station platform she was immediately appropriated by her hostess whose commanding figure and assurance of attire she had recognized from a distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was hurried into a high tilbury and flavia taking the drivers cushion beside her gathered up the reins with an experienced hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear girl she remarked as she turned the horses up the street i was afraid the train might be late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roux insisted upon coming up by boat and did not arrive until after seven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rouxs being in this part of the world at all and subject to the vicissitudes of river boats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why in the world did he come over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is the sort of man who must dissolve and become a shadow outside of paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh we have a houseful of the most interesting people said flavia professionally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have actually managed to get ivan schemetzkin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was ill in california at the close of his concert tour you know and he is recuperating with us after his wearing journey from the coast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there is jules martel the painter signor donati the tenor professor schotte who has dug up assyria you know restzhoff the russian chemist alcee buisson the philologist frank wellington the novelist and will maidenwood the editor of iwomani <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there is my second cousin jemima broadwood who made such a hit in pineros comedy last winter and frau lichtenfeld <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen confessed her utter ignorance of frau lichtenfeld and flavia went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well she is a most remarkable person one of those advanced german women a militant iconoclast and this drive will not be long enough to permit of my telling you her history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her novels were the talk of all germany when i was there last and several of them have been suppressedan honor in germany i understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at whose door has been translated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am so unfortunate as not to read german <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im all excitement at the prospect of meeting miss broadwood said imogen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive seen her in nearly everything she does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she always reminds me of a nice clean pinkandwhite boy who has just had his cold bath and come down all aglow for a run before breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes but isnt it unfortunate that she will limit herself to those minor comedy parts that are so little appreciated in this country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one ought to be satisfied with nothing less than the best ought one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the peculiar breathy tone in which flavia always uttered that word best the most worn in her vocabulary always jarred on imogen and always made her obdurate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont at all agree with you she said reservedly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought everyone admitted that the most remarkable thing about miss broadwood is her admirable sense of fitness which is rare enough in her profession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia could not endure being contradicted she always seemed to regard it in the light of a defeat and usually colored unbecomingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look my dear she cried there is frau lichtenfeld now coming to meet us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doesnt she look as if she had just escaped out of valhalla <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is actually over six feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen saw a woman of immense stature in a very short skirt and a broad flapping sun hat striding down the hillside at a long swinging gait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the refugee from valhalla approached panting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her heavy teutonic features were scarlet from the rigor of her exercise and her hair under her flapping sun hat was tightly befrizzled about her brow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she fixed her sharp little eves upon imogen and extended both her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so this is the little friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried in a rolling baritone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen was quite as tall as her hostess but everything she reflected is comparative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could ask you to drive up with us frau lichtenfeld <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the giantess drooping her head in humorous caricature of a timehonored pose of the heroines of sentimental romances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has never been my fate to be fitted into corners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never known the sweet privileges of the tiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laughing flavia started the ponies and the colossal woman standing in the middle of the dusty road took off her wide hat and waved them a farewell which in scope of gesture recalled the salute of a plumed cavalier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they arrived at the house imogen looked about her with keen curiosity for this was veritably the work of flavias hands the materialization of hopes long deferred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they passed directly into a large square hall with a gallery on three sides studio fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this opened at one end into a dutch breakfast room beyond which was the large dining room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the other end of the hall was the music room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a smoking room which one entered through the library behind the staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the second floor there was the same general arrangement a square hall and opening from it the guest chambers or as miss broadwood termed them the cages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when imogen went to her room the guests had begun to return from their various afternoon excursions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> boys were gliding through the halls with ice water covered trays and flowers colliding with maids and valets who carried shoes and other articles of wearing apparel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet all this was done in response to inaudible bells on felt soles and in hushed voices so that there was very little confusion about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia had at last built her house and hewn out her seven pillars there could be no doubt now that the asylum for talent the sanatorium of the arts so long projected was an accomplished fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her ambition had long ago outgrown the dimensions of her house on prairie avenue besides she had bitterly complained that in chicago traditions were against her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her project had been delayed by arthurs doggedly standing out for the michigan woods but flavia knew well enough that certain of the irarae avesithe bestcould not be lured so far away from the seaport so she declared herself for the historic hudson and knew no retreat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the establishing of a new york office had at length overthrown arthurs last valid objection to quitting the lake country for three months of the year and arthur could be wearied into anything as those who knew him knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavias house was the mirror of her exultation it was a temple to the gods of victory a sort of triumphal arch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in her earlier days she had swallowed experiences that would have unmanned one of less torrential enthusiasm or blind pertinacity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but of late years her determination had told she saw less and less of those mysterious persons with mysterious obstacles in their path and mysterious grievances against the world who had once frequented her house on prairie avenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the stead of this multitude of the unarrived she had now the few the select the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all that band of indigent retainers who had once fed at her board like the suitors in the halls of penelope only alcee buisson still retained his right of entree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he alone had remembered that ambition hath a knapsack at his back wherein he puts alms to oblivion and he alone had been considerate enough to do what flavia had expected of him and give his name a current value in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as miss broadwood put it he was her first real oneand flavia like mohammed could remember her first believer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the house of song as miss broadwood had called it was the outcome of flavias more exalted strategies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a woman who made less a point of sympathizing with their delicate organisms might have sought to plunge these phosphorescent pieces into the tepid bath of domestic life but flavias discernment was deeper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this must be a refuge where the shrinking soul the sensitive brain should be unconstrained where the caprice of fancy should outweigh the civil code if necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she considered that this much arthur owed her for she in her turn had made concessions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia had indeed quite an equipment of epigrams to the effect that our century creates the iron genii which evolve its fairy tales but the fact that her husbands name was annually painted upon some ten thousand threshing machines in reality contributed very little to her happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arthur hamilton was born and had spent his boyhood in the west indies and physically he had never lost the brand of the tropics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his father after inventing the machine which bore his name had returned to the states to patent and manufacture it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after leaving college arthur had spent five years ranching in the west and traveling abroad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> upon his fathers death he had returned to chicago and to the astonishment of all his friends had taken up the businesswithout any demonstration of enthusiasm but with quiet perseverance marked ability and amazing industry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why or how a selfsufficient rather ascetic man of thirty indifferent in manner wholly negative in all other personal relations should have doggedly wooed and finally married flavia malcolm was a problem that had vexed older heads than imogens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while imogen was dressing she heard a knock at her door and a young woman entered whom she at once recognized as jemima broadwoodjimmy broadwood she was called by people in her own profession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while there was something unmistakably professional in her frank isavoirfairei jimmys was one of those faces to which the rouge never seems to stick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her eyes were keen and gray as a windy april sky and so far from having been seared by calcium lights you might have fancied they had never looked on anything less bucolic than growing fields and country fairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore her thick brown hair short and parted at the side and rather than hinting at freakishness this seemed admirably in keeping with her fresh boyish countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she extended to imogen a large wellshaped hand which it was a pleasure to clasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are miss willard and i see i need not introduce myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia said you were kind enough to express a wish to meet me and i preferred to meet you alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mind if i smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why certainly not said imogen somewhat disconcerted and looking hurriedly about for matches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there be calm im always prepared said miss broadwood checking imogens flurry with a soothing gesture and producing an oddly fashioned silver matchcase from some mysterious recess in her dinner gown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat down in a deep chair crossed her patentleather oxfords and lit her cigarette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this matchbox she went on meditatively once belonged to a prussian officer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shot himself in his bathtub and i bought it at the sale of his effects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen had not yet found any suitable reply to make to this rather irrelevant confidence when miss broadwood turned to her cordially im awfully glad youve come miss willard though ive not quite decided why you did it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted very much to meet you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia gave me your thesis to read <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary remarked miss broadwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought it decidedly lacked humor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meant stammered imogen beginning to feel very much like alice in wonderland i meant that i thought it rather strange mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hamilton should fancy you would be interested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now dont let my rudeness frighten you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really i found it very interesting and no end impressive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see most people in my profession are good for absolutely nothing else and therefore they have a deep and abiding conviction that in some other line they might have shone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strange to say scholarship is the object of our envious and particular admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything in type impresses us greatly thats why so many of us marry authors or newspapermen and lead miserable lives <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss broadwood saw that she had rather disconcerted imogen and blithely tacked in another direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see she went on tossing aside her halfconsumed cigarette some years ago flavia would not have deemed me worthy to open the pages of your thesisnor to be one of her house party of the chosen for that matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive pinero to thank for both pleasures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it all depends on the class of business im playing whether im in favor or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia is my second cousin you know so i can say whatever disagreeable things i choose with perfect good grace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im quite desperate for someone to laugh with so im going to fasten myself upon youfor of course one cant expect any of these gypsydago people to see anything funny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont intend you shall lose the humor of the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you think of flavias infirmary for the arts anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well its rather too soon for me to have any opinion at all said imogen as she again turned to her dressing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so far you are the only one of the artists ive met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my offense may be rank my dear but i really dont deserve that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come now whatever badges of my tribe i may bear upon me just let me divest you of any notion that i take myself seriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen turned from the mirror in blank astonishment and sat down on the arm of a chair facing her visitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant fathom you at all miss broadwood she said frankly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why shouldnt you take yourself seriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats the use of beating about the bush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely you know that you are one of the few players on this side of the water who have at all the spirit of natural or ingenuous comedy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now we are quite even about the thesis arent we <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you iarei a clever girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you see it doesnt do to permit oneself to look at it in that light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we do we always go to pieces and waste our substance astarring as the unhappy daughter of the capulets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there i hear flavia coming to take you down and just remember im not one of themthe artists i mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia conducted imogen and miss broadwood downstairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they reached the lower hall they heard voices from the music room and dim figures were lurking in the shadows under the gallery but their hostess led straight to the smoking room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the june evening was chilly and a fire had been lighted in the fireplace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through the deepening dusk the firelight flickered upon the pipes and curious weapons on the wall and threw an orange glow over the turkish hangings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one side of the smoking room was entirely of glass separating it from the conservatory which was flooded with white light from the electric bulbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was about the darkened room some suggestion of certain chambers in the arabian nights opening on a court of palms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it was partially this memoryevoking suggestion that caused imogen to start so violently when she saw dimly in a blur of shadow the figure of a man who sat smoking in a low deep chair before the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was long and thin and brown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his long nerveless hands drooped from the arms of his chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a brown mustache shaded his mouth and his eyes were sleepy and apathetic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when imogen entered he rose indolently and gave her his hand his manner barely courteous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am glad you arrived promptly miss willard he said with an indifferent drawl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia was afraid you might be late <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had a pleasant ride up i hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hamilton she replied feeling that he did not particularly care whether she replied at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia explained that she had not yet had time to dress for dinner as she had been attending to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will maidenwood who had become faint after hurting his finger in an obdurate window and immediately excused herself as she left hamilton turned to miss broadwood with a rather spiritless smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well jimmy he remarked i brought up a piano box full of fireworks for the boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do you suppose well manage to keep them until the fourth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant unless we steel ourselves to deny there are any on the premises said miss broadwood seating herself on a low stool by hamiltons chair and leaning back against the mantel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> have you seen helen and has she told you the tragedy of the tooth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she met me at the station with her tooth wrapped up in tissue paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had tea with her an hour ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> better sit down miss willard he rose and pushed a chair toward imogen who was standing peering into the conservatory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are scheduled to dine at seven but they seldom get around before eight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by this time imogen had made out that here the plural pronoun third person always referred to the artists <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as hamiltons manner did not spur one to cordial intercourse and as his attention seemed directed to miss broadwood insofar as it could be said to be directed to anyone she sat down facing the conservatory and watched him unable to decide in how far he was identical with the man who had first met flavia malcolm in her mothers house twelve years ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did he at all remember having known her as a little girl and why did his indifference hurt her so after all these years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had some remnant of her childish affection for him gone on living somewhere down in the sealed caves of her consciousness and had she really expected to find it possible to be fond of him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly she saw a light in the mans sleepy eyes an unmistakable expression of interest and pleasure that fairly startled her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned quickly in the direction of his glance and saw flavia just entering dressed for dinner and lit by the effulgence of her most radiant manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most people considered flavia handsome and there was no gainsaying that she carried her fiveandthirty years splendidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her figure had never grown matronly and her face was of the sort that does not show wear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its blond tints were as fresh and enduring as enameland quite as hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its usual expression was one of tense often strained animation which compressed her lips nervously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a perfect scream of animation miss broadwood had called it created and maintained by sheer indomitable force of will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavias appearance on any scene whatever made a ripple caused a certain agitation and recognition and among impressionable people a certain uneasiness for all her sparkling assurance of manner flavia was certainly always ill at ease and even more certainly anxious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed not convinced of the established order of material things seemed always trying to conceal her feeling that walls might crumble chasms open or the fabric of her life fly to the winds in irretrievable entanglement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least this was the impression imogen got from that note in flavia which was so manifestly false <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hamiltons keen quick satisfied glance at his wife had recalled to imogen all her inventory of speculations about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with compassionate surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a child she had never permitted herself to believe that hamilton cared at all for the woman who had taken him away from her and since she had begun to think about them again it had never occurred to her that anyone could become attached to flavia in that deeply personal and exclusive sense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed quite as irrational as trying to possess oneself of broadway at noon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they went out to dinner imogen realized the completeness of flavias triumph <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were people of one name mostly like kings people whose names stirred the imagination like a romance or a melody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the notable exception of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roux imogen had seen most of them before either in concert halls or lecture rooms but they looked noticeably older and dimmer than she remembered them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> opposite her sat schemetzkin the russian pianist a short corpulent man with an apoplectic face and purplish skin his thick irongray hair tossed back from his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next to the german giantess sat the italian tenor the tiniest of menpale with soft light hair much in disorder very red lips and fingers yellowed by cigarettes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frau lichtenfeld shone in a gown of emerald green fitting so closely as to enhance her natural floridness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however to do the good lady justice let her attire be never so modest it gave an effect of barbaric splendor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at her left sat herr schotte the assyriologist whose features were effectually concealed by the convergence of his hair and beard and whose glasses were continually falling into his plate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gentleman had removed more tons of earth in the course of his explorations than had any of his confreres and his vigorous attack upon his food seemed to suggest the strenuous nature of his accustomed toil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes were small and deeply set and his forehead bulged fiercely above his eves in a bony ridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his heavy brows completed the leonine suggestion of his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even to imogen who knew something of his work and greatly respected it he was entirely too reminiscent of the stone age to be altogether an agreeable dinner companion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed indeed to have absorbed something of the savagery of those early types of life which he continually studied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank wellington the young kansas man who had been two years out of harvard and had published three historical novels sat next to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will maidenwood who was still pale from his recent sufferings and carried his hand bandaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they took little part in the general conversation but like the lion and the unicorn were always at it discussing every time they met whether there were or were not passages in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellingtons works which should be eliminated out of consideration for the young person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellington had fallen into the hands of a great american syndicate which most effectually befriended struggling authors whose struggles were in the right direction and which had guaranteed to make him famous before he was thirty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> feeling the security of his position he stoutly defended those passages which jarred upon the sensitive nerves of the young editor of iwomani <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maidenwood in the smoothest of voices urged the necessity of the authors recognizing certain restrictions at the outset and miss broadwood who joined the argument quite without invitation or encouragement seconded him with pointed and malicious remarks which caused the young editor manifest discomfort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> restzhoff the chemist demanded the attention of the entire company for his exposition of his devices for manufacturing ice cream from vegetable oils and for administering drugs in bonbons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia always noticeably restless at dinner was somewhat apathetic toward the advocate of peptonized chocolate and was plainly concerned about the sudden departure of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roux who had announced that it would be necessary for him to leave tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emile roux who sat at flavias right was a man in middle life and quite bald clearly without personal vanity though his publishers preferred to circulate only those of his portraits taken in his ambrosial youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen was considerably shocked at his unlikeness to the slender blackstocked rolla he had looked at twenty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had declined into the florid settled heaviness of indifference and approaching age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was however a certain look of durability and solidity about him the look of a man who has earned the right to be fat and bald and even silent at dinner if he chooses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> throughout the discussion between wellington and will maidenwood though they invited his participation he remained silent betraying no sign either of interest or contempt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since his arrival he had directed most of his conversation to hamilton who had never read one of his twelve great novels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the night of his arrival jules martel had enthusiastically declared there are schools and schools manners and manners but roux is roux and paris sets its watches by his clock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia bad already repeated this remark to imogen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it haunted her and each time she quoted it she was impressed anew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia shifted the conversation uneasily evidently exasperated and excited by her repeated failures to draw the novelist out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur roux she began abruptly with her most animated smile i remember so well a statement i read some years ago in your mes etudes des femmes to the effect that you had never met a really intellectual woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i ask without being impertinent whether that assertion still represents your experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meant madam said the novelist conservatively intellectual in a sense very special as we say of men in whom the purely intellectual functions seem almost independent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you still think a woman so constituted a mythical personage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> persisted flavia nodding her head encouragingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iune medusei madam who if she were discovered would transmute us all into stone said the novelist bowing gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she existed at all he added deliberately it was my business to find her and she has cost me many a vain pilgrimage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like rudel of tripoli i have crossed seas and penetrated deserts to seek her out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have indeed encountered women of learning whose industry i have been compelled to respect many who have possessed beauty and charm and perplexing cleverness a few with remarkable information and a sort of fatal facility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> browning george eliot and your own mme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> queried flavia with that fervid enthusiasm with which she could on occasion utter things simply incomprehensible for their banalityat her feats of this sort miss broadwood was wont to sit breathless with admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madam while the intellect was undeniably present in the performances of those women it was only the stick of the rocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although this woman has eluded me i have studied her conditions and perturbances as astronomers conjecture the orbits of planets they have never seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she exists she is probably neither an artist nor a woman with a mission but an obscure personage with imperative intellectual needs who absorbs rather than produces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia still nodding nervously fixed a strained glance of interrogation upon m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you think she would be a woman whose first necessity would be to know whose instincts would be satisfied only with the best who could draw from others appreciative merely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the novelist lifted his dull eyes to his interlocutress with an untranslatable smile and a slight inclination of his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exactly so you are really remarkable madam he added in a tone of cold astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after dinner the guests took their coffee in the music room where schemetzkin sat down at the piano to drum ragtime and give his celebrated imitation of the boardingschool girls execution of chopin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flatly refused to play anything more serious and would practice only in the morning when he had the music room to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roux repaired to the smoking room to discuss the necessity of extending the tax on manufactured articles in franceone of those conversations which particularly exasperated flavia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after schemetzkin had grimaced and tortured the keyboard with malicious vulgarities for half an hour signor donati to put an end to his torture consented to sing and flavia and imogen went to fetch arthur to play his accompaniments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hamilton rose with an annoyed look and placed his cigarette on the mantel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why yes flavia ill accompany him provided he sings something with a melody italian arias or ballads and provided the recital is not interminable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you but i have some letters to write replied the novelist bowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as flavia had remarked to imogen arthur really played accompaniments remarkably well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to hear him recalled vividly the days of her childhood when he always used to spend his business vacations at her mothers home in maine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had possessed for her that almost hypnotic influence which young men sometimes exert upon little girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a sort of phantom love affair subjective and fanciful a precocity of instinct like that tender and maternal concern which some little girls feel for their dolls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet this childish infatuation is capable of all the depressions and exaltations of love itself it has its bitter jealousies cruel disappointments its exacting caprices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> summer after summer she had awaited his coming and wept at his departure indifferent to the gayer young men who had called her their sweetheart and laughed at everything she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although hamilton never said so she had been always quite sure that he was fond of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he pulled her up the river to hunt for fairy knolls shut about by low hanging willows he was often silent for an hour at a time yet she never felt he was bored or was neglecting her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would lie in the sand smoking his eyes halfclosed watching her play and she was always conscious that she was entertaining him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes he would take a copy of alice in wonderland in his pocket and no one could read it as he could laughing at her with his dark eyes when anything amused him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one else could laugh so with just their eyes and without moving a muscle of their face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though he usually smiled at passages that seemed not at all funny to the child she always laughed gleefully because he was so seldom moved to mirth that any such demonstration delighted her and she took the credit of it entirely to herself her own inclination had been for serious stories with sad endings like the little mermaid which he had once told her in an unguarded moment when she had a cold and was put to bed early on her birthday night and cried because she could not have her party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he highly disapproved of this preference and had called it a morbid taste and always shook his finger at her when she asked for the story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had been particularly good or particularly neglected by other people then he would sometimes melt and tell her the story and never laugh at her if she enjoyed the sad ending even to tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when flavia had taken him away and he came no more she wept inconsolably for the space of two weeks and refused to learn her lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she found the story of the little mermaid herself and forgot him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen had discovered at dinner that he could still smile at one secretly out of his eyes and that he had the old manner of outwardly seeming bored but letting you know that he was not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was intensely curious about his exact state of feeling toward his wife and more curious still to catch a sense of his final adjustment to the conditions of life in general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this she could not help feeling she might get againif she could have him alone for an hour in some place where there was a little river and a sandy cove bordered by drooping willows and a blue sky seen through white sycamore boughs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that evening before retiring flavia entered her husbands room where be sat in his smoking jacket in one of his favorite low chairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose its a grave responsibility to bring an ardent serious young thing like imogen here among all these fascinating personages she remarked reflectively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after all one can never tell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these grave silent girls have their own charm even for facile people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh so that is your plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was wondering why you got her up here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she doesnt seem to mix well with the faciles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least so it struck me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia paid no heed to this jeering remark but repeated no after all it may not be a bad thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then do consign her to that shaken reed the tenor said her husband yawning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember she used to have a taste for the pathetic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then remarked flavia coquettishly after all i owe her mother a return in kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was not afraid to trifle with destiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but hamilton was asleep in his chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next morning imogen found only miss broadwood in the breakfast room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good morning my dear girl whatever are you doing up so early <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most of them take their coffee in their room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss broadwood looked particularly fresh and encouraging in her blue serge walking skirt her open jacket displaying an expanse of stiff white shirt bosom dotted with some almost imperceptible figure and a dark blueandwhite necktie neatly knotted under her wide rolling collar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore a white rosebud in the lapel of her coat and decidedly she seemed more than ever like a nice clean boy on his holiday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen was just hoping that they would breakfast alone when miss broadwood exclaimed ah there comes arthur with the children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the reward of early rising in this house you never get to see the youngsters at any other time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hamilton entered followed by two dark handsome little boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl who was very tiny blonde like her mother and exceedingly frail he carried in his arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys came up and said good morning with an ease and cheerfulness uncommon even in wellbred children but the little girl hid her face on her fathers shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes a shy little lady he explained as he put her gently down in her chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im afraid shes like her father she cant seem to get used to meeting people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you miss willard did you dream of the white rabbit or the little mermaid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i dreamed of them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the personages of that buried civilization cried imogen delighted that his estranged manner of the night before had entirely vanished and feeling that somehow the old confidential relations had been restored during the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come william said miss broadwood turning to the younger of the two boys and what did you dream about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dreamed said william gravelyhe was the more assertive of the two and always spoke for bothwe dreamed that there were fireworks hidden in the basement of the carriage house lots and lots of fireworks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his elder brother looked up at him with apprehensive astonishment while miss broadwood hastily put her napkin to her lips and hamilton dropped his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if little boys dream things they are so apt not to come true he reflected sadly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this shook even the redoubtable william and he glanced nervously at his brother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but do things vanish just because they have been dreamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> generally that is the very best reason for their vanishing said arthur gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but father people cant help what they dream remonstrated edward gently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre making these children talk like a maeterlinck dialogue laughed miss broadwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia presently entered a book in her hand and bade them all good morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come little people which story shall it be this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> greatly excited the children followed her into the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she does then sometimes murmured imogen as they left the breakfast room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes to be sure said miss broadwood cheerfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reads a story to them every morning in the most picturesque part of the garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother of the gracchi you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she does so long she says for the time when they will be intellectual companions for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you say to a walk over the hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they left the house they met frau lichtenfeld and the bushy herr schottethe professor cut an astonishing figure in golf stockingsreturning from a walk and engaged in an animated conversation on the tendencies of german fiction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arent they the most attractive little children exclaimed imogen as they wound down the road toward the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes and you must not fail to tell flavia that you think so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she will look at you in a sort of startled way and say yes arent they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and maybe she will go off and hunt them up and have tea with them to fully appreciate them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is awfully afraid of missing anything good is flavia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the way those youngsters manage to conceal their guilty presence in the house of song is a wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but dont any of the artistfolk fancy children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes they just fancy them and no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chemist remarked the other day that children are like certain salts which need not be actualized because the formulae are quite sufficient for practical purposes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see how even flavia can endure to have that man about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have always been rather curious to know what arthur thinks of it all remarked imogen cautiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why my dear what would any man think of having his house turned into an hotel habited by freaks who discharge his servants borrow his money and insult his neighbors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this place is shunned like a lazaretto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then why does hewhy does he persisted imogen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interrupted miss broadwood impatiently why did he in the first place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exactly so said miss broadwood sharply as she snapped the lid of her matchbox <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose that is a question rather beyond us and certainly one which we cannot discuss said imogen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his toleration on this one point puzzles me quite apart from other complications <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why this point as you call it simply is flavia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who could conceive of her without it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know where its all going to end im sure and im equally sure that if it were not for arthur i shouldnt care declared miss broadwood drawing her shoulders together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but will it end at all now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such an absurd state of things cant go on indefinitely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man isnt going to see his wife make a guy of herself forever is he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chaos has already begun in the servants quarters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are six different languages spoken there now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see its all on an entirely false basis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia hasnt the slightest notion of what these people are really like their good and their bad alike escape her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they on the other hand cant imagine what she is driving at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now arthur is worse off than either faction he is not in the fairy story in that he sees these people exactly as they are ibuti he is utterly unable to see flavia as they see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why cant he see her as we do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear that has kept me awake o nights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this man who has thought so much and lived so much who is naturally a critic really takes flavia at very nearly her own estimate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now i am entering upon a wilderness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from a brief acquaintance with her you can know nothing of the icy fastnesses of flavias self esteem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peters you cant realize its magnitude at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have to grow into a sense of it by living under its shadow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has perplexed even emile roux that merciless dissector of egoism <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she has puzzled him the more because be saw at a glance what some of them do not perceive at once and what will be mercifully concealed from arthur until the trump sounds namely that all flavias artists have done or ever will do means exactly as much to her as a symphony means to an oyster that there is no bridge by which the significance of any work of art could be conveyed to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then in the name of goodness why does she bother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is pretty wealthy wellestablished why should she bother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant pretend to analyze it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reads papers on the literary landmarks of paris the loves of the poets and that sort of thing to clubs out in chicago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to flavia it is more necessary to be called clever than to breathe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would give a good deal to know that glum frenchmans diagnosis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has been watching her out of those fishy eyes of his as a biologist watches a hemisphereless frog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rouxs departure flavia gave an embarrassing share of her attention to imogen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> embarrassing because imogen had the feeling of being energetically and futilely explored she knew not for what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she felt herself under the globe of an air pump expected to yield up something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she confined the conversation to matters of general interest flavia conveyed to her with some pique that her one endeavor in life had been to fit herself to converse with her friends upon those things which vitally interested them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one has no right to accept their best from people unless one gives isnt it so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to be able to give <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet whenever imogen strove to pay her tithes and plunged bravely into her plans for study next winter flavia grew absentminded and interrupted her by amazing generalizations or by such embarrassing questions as and these grim studies really have charm for you you are quite buried in them they make other things seem light and ephemeral <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rather feel as though i had got in here under false pretenses imogen confided to miss broadwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure i dont know what it is that she wants of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah chuckled jemima you are not equal to these heart to heart talks with flavia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you utterly fail to communicate to her the atmosphere of that untroubled joy in which you dwell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must remember that she gets no feeling out of things herself and she demands that you impart yours to her by some process of psychic transmission <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i once met a blind girl blind from birth who could discuss the peculiarities of the barbizon school with just flavias glibness and enthusiasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ordinarily flavia knows how to get what she wants from people and her memory is wonderful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one evening i heard her giving frau lichtenfeld some random impressions about hedda gabler which she extracted from me five years ago giving them with an impassioned conviction of which i was never guilty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i have known other people who could appropriate your stories and opinions flavia is infinitely more subtle than that she can soak up the very thrash and drift of your daydreams and take the very thrills off your back as it were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after some days of unsuccessful effort flavia withdrew herself and imogen found hamilton ready to catch her when she was tossed afield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed only to have been awaiting this crisis and at once their old intimacy reestablished itself as a thing inevitable and beautifully prepared for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she convinced herself that she had not been mistaken in him despite all the doubts that had come up in later years and this renewal of faith set more than one question thumping in her brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how did he how can he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she kept repeating with a tinge of her childish resentment what right had he to waste anything so fine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when imogen and arthur were returning from a walk before luncheon one morning about a week after m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rouxs departure they noticed an absorbed group before one of the hall windows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> herr schotte and restzhoff sat on the window seat with a newspaper between them while wellington schemetzkin and will maidenwood looked over their shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed intensely interested herr schotte occasionally pounding his knees with his fists in ebullitions of barbaric glee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when imogen entered the hall however the men were all sauntering toward the breakfast room and the paper was lying innocently on the divan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during luncheon the personnel of that window group were unwontedly animated and agreeable all save schemetzkin whose stare was blanker than ever as though rouxs mantle of insulting indifference had fallen upon him in addition to his own oblivious self absorption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will maidenwood seemed embarrassed and annoyed the chemist employed himself with making polite speeches to hamilton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia did not come down to lunchand there was a malicious gleam under herr schottes eyebrows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frank wellington announced nervously that an imperative letter from his protecting syndicate summoned him to the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after luncheon the men went to the golf links and imogen at the first opportunity possessed herself of the newspaper which had been left on the divan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the first things that caught her eye was an article headed roux on tuft hunters the advanced american woman as he sees her aggressive superficial and insincere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the entire interview was nothing more nor less than a satiric characterization of flavia aquiver with irritation and vitriolic malice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one could mistake it it was done with all his deftness of portraiture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen had not finished the article when she heard a footstep and clutching the paper she started precipitately toward the stairway as arthur entered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he put out his hand looking critically at her distressed face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wait a moment miss willard he said peremptorily i want to see whether we can find what it was that so interested our friends this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen grew quite white as he opened the journal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reached forward and crumpled it with her hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please dont please dont she pleaded its something i dont want you to see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its just something low and despicable that you cant notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arthur had gently loosed her hands and he pointed her to a chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lit a cigar and read the article through without comment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had finished it he walked to the fireplace struck a match and tossed the flaming journal between the brass andirons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are right he remarked as he came back dusting his hands with his handkerchief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are extremes of blackguardism for which we have no name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only thing necessary is to see that flavia gets no wind of this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this seems to be my cue to act poor girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen looked at him tearfully she could only murmur oh why did you read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come dont you worry about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you always took other peoples troubles too seriously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you were little and all the world was gay and everybody happy you must needs get the little mermaids troubles to grieve over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come with me into the music room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you remember the musical setting i once made you for the lay of the jabberwock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was trying it over the other night long after you were in bed and i decided it was quite as fine as the erlking music <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how i wish i could give you some of the cake that alice ate and make you a little girl again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then when you had got through the glass door into the little garden you could call to me perhaps and tell me all the fine things that were going on there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a pity it is that you ever grew up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added laughing and imogen too was thinking just that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at dinner that evening flavia with fatal persistence insisted upon turning the conversation to m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been reading one of his novels and had remembered anew that paris set its watches by his clock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen surmised that she was tortured by a feeling that she had not sufficiently appreciated him while she had had him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she first mentioned his name she was answered only by the pall of silence that fell over the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then everyone began to talk at once as though to correct a false position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they spoke of him with a fervid defiant admiration with the sort of hot praise that covers a double purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen fancied she could see that they felt a kind of relief at what the man had done even those who despised him for doing it that they felt a spiteful hate against flavia as though she had tricked them and a certain contempt for themselves that they had been beguiled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was reminded of the fury of the crowd in the fairy tale when once the child had called out that the king was in his night clothes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely these people knew no more about flavia than they had known before but the mere fact that the thing had been said altered the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia meanwhile sat chattering amiably pathetically unconscious of her nakedness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hamilton lounged fingering the stem of his wineglass gazing down the table at one face after another and studying the various degrees of selfconsciousness they exhibited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a lull came in the spasmodic flow of conversation arthur leaning back in his chair remarked deliberately as for m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roux his very profession places him in that class of men whom society has never been able to accept unconditionally because it has never been able to assume that they have any ordered notion of taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he and his ilk remain with the mountebanks and snake charmers people indispensable to our civilization but wholly unreclaimed by it people whom we receive but whose invitations we do not accept <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately for flavia this mine was not exploded until just before the coffee was brought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her laughter was pitiful to hear it echoed through the silent room as in a vault while she made some tremulously light remark about her husbands drollery grim as a jest from the dying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one responded and she sat nodding her head like a mechanical toy and smiling her white set smile through her teeth until alcee buisson and frau lichtenfeld came to her support <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after dinner the guests retired immediately to their rooms and imogen went upstairs on tiptoe feeling the echo of breakage and the dust of crumbling in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wondered whether flavias habitual note of uneasiness were not in a manner prophetic and a sort of unconscious premonition after all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat down to write a letter but she found herself so nervous her head so hot and her hands so cold that she soon abandoned the effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as she was about to seek miss broadwood flavia entered and embraced her hysterically <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dearest girl she began was there ever such an unfortunate and incomprehensible speech made before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it is scarcely necessary to explain to you poor arthurs lack of tact and that he meant nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can they be expected to understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will feel wretchedly about it when he realizes what he has done but in the meantime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we were so fortunate as to get him and he made himself so unreservedly agreeable and i fancied that in his way arthur quite admired him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear you have no idea what that speech has done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> schemetzkin and herr schotte have already sent me word that they must leave us tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a thing from a host <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia paused choked by tears of vexation and despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen was thoroughly disconcerted this was the first time she had ever seen flavia betray any personal emotion which was indubitably genuine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she replied with what consolation she could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> need they take it personally at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a mere observation upon a class of people which he knows nothing whatever about and with whom he has no sympathy interrupted flavia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah my dear you could not be iexpectedi to understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you cant realize knowing arthur as you do his entire lack of any aesthetic sense whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is absolutely inili stone deaf and stark blind on that side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he doesnt mean to be brutal it is just the brutality of utter ignorance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they always feel itthey are so sensitive to unsympathetic influences you know they know it the moment they come into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have spent my life apologizing for him and struggling to conceal it but in spite of me he wounds them his very attitude even in silence offends them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it not perpetually and forever wounding me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there has never been anything so dreadful as thisnever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i could conceive of any possible motive even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hamilton it was after all a mere expression of opinion such as we are any of us likely to venture upon any subject whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was neither more personal nor more extravagant than many of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a part of his art and that is altogether another matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh this is not the only instance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> continued flavia passionately ive always had that narrow bigoted prejudice to contend with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has always held me back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you mistake his attitude replied imogen feeling a flush that made her ears tingle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is i fancy he is more appreciative than he seems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man cant be very demonstrative about those thingsnot if he is a real man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should not think you would care much about saving the feelings of people who are too narrow to admit of any other point of view than their own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stopped finding herself in the impossible position of attempting to explain hamilton to his wife a task which if once begun would necessitate an entire course of enlightenment which she doubted flavias ability to receive and which she could offer only with very poor grace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats just where it stings mosthere flavia began pacing the floorit is just because they have all shown such tolerance and have treated arthur with such unfailing consideration that i can find no reasonable pretext for his rancor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how can he fail to see the value of such friendships on the childrens account if for nothing else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what an advantage for them to grow up among such associations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even though he cares nothing about these things himself he might realize that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there nothing i could say by way of explanation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if someone were to explain to them how unfortunately limited he is in these things im afraid i cannot advise you said imogen decidedly but that at least seems to me impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia took her hand and glanced at her affectionately nodding nervously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course dear girl i cant ask you to be quite frank with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor child you are trembling and your hands are icy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you must not judge him by this altogether think how much he misses in life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a cruel shock youve had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill send you some sherry good night my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when flavia shut the door imogen burst into a fit of nervous weeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next morning she awoke after a troubled and restless night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at eight oclock miss broadwood entered in a red and white striped bathrobe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up up and see the great dooms image <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried her eyes sparkling with excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hall is full of trunks they are packing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its you ima cheriei youve brought ulysses home again and the slaughter has begun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she blew a cloud of smoke triumphantly from her lips and threw herself into a chair beside the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen rising on her elbow plunged excitedly into the story of the roux interview which miss broadwood heard with the keenest interest frequently interrupting her with exclamations of delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when imogen reached the dramatic scene which terminated in the destruction of the newspaper miss broadwood rose and took a turn about the room violently switching the tasselled cords of her bathrobe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop a moment she cried you mean to tell me that he had such a heavensent means to bring her to her senses and didnt use itthat he held such a weapon and threw it away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he bared his back to the tormentor signed himself over to punishment in that speech he made at dinner which everyone understands but flavia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was here for an hour last night and disregarded every limit of taste in her maledictions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried miss broadwood catching her hand in inordinate delight at the situation do you see what he has done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therell be no end to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why he has sacrificed himself to spare the very vanity that devours him put rancors in the vessels of his peace and his eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man to make them kings the seed of banquo kings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes like a pillar of sanity and law in this house of shams and swollen vanities where people stalk about with a sort of madhouse dignity each one fancying himself a king or a pope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you could have heard that woman talk of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why she thinks him stupid bigoted blinded by middleclass prejudices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she talked about his having no aesthetic sense and insisted that her artists had always shown him tolerance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know why it should get on my nerves so im sure but her stupidity and assurance are enough to drive one to the brink of collapse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes as opposed to his singular fineness they are calculated to do just that said miss broadwood gravely wisely ignoring imogens tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what has been is nothing to what will be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just wait until flavias black swans have flown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you ought not to try to stick it out that would only make it harder for everyone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose you let me telephone your mother to wire you to come home by the evening train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything rather than have her come at me like that again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it puts me in a perfectly impossible position and he iisi so fine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course it does said miss broadwood sympathetically and there is no good to be got from facing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will stay because such things interest me and frau lichtenfeld will stay because she has no money to get away and buisson will stay because he feels somewhat responsible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these complications are interesting enough to coldblooded folk like myself who have an eye for the dramatic element but they are distracting and demoralizing to young people with any serious purpose in life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss broadwoods counsel was all the more generous seeing that for her the most interesting element of this denouement would be eliminated by imogens departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she goes now shell get over it soliloquized miss broadwood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she stays shell be wrung for him and the hurt may go deep enough to last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent the heart to see her spoiling things for herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> willard and helped imogen to pack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she even took it upon herself to break the news of imogens going to arthur right enough too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what should she do here with old cynics like you and me jimmy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing that she is brim full of dates and formulae and other positivisms and is so girt about with illusions that she still casts a shadow in the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve been very tender of her havent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to think it may all be gone when we see her next <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the common fate of all things rare you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a good fellow you are anyway jimmy he added putting his hands affectionately on her shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arthur went with them to the station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia was so prostrated by the concerted action of her guests that she was able to see imogen only for a moment in her darkened sleeping chamber where she kissed her hysterically without lifting her head bandaged in aromatic vinegar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the way to the station both arthur and imogen threw the burden of keeping up appearances entirely upon miss broadwood who blithely rose to the occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when hamilton carried imogens bag into the car miss broadwood detained her for a moment whispering as she gave her a large warm handclasp ill come to see you when i get back to town and in the meantime if you meet any of our artists tell them you have left caius marius among the ruins of carthage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a group of the townspeople stood on the station siding of a little kansas town awaiting the coming of the night train which was already twenty minutes overdue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the snow had fallen thick over everything in the pale starlight the line of bluffs across the wide white meadows south of the town made soft smoke colored curves against the clear sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men on the siding stood first on one foot and then on the other their hands thrust deep into their trousers pockets their overcoats open their shoulders screwed up with the cold and they glanced from time to time toward the southeast where the railroad track wound along the river shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they conversed in low tones and moved about restlessly seeming uncertain as to what was expected of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was but one of the company who looked as though he knew exactly why he was there and he kept conspicuously apart walking to the far end of the platform returning to the station door then pacing up the track again his chin sunk in the high collar of his overcoat his burly shoulders drooping forward his gait heavy and dogged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently he was approached by a tall spare grizzled man clad in a faded grand army suit who shuffled out from the group and advanced with a certain deference craning his neck forward until his back made the angle of a jackknife threequarters open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon shes agoin to be pretty late agin tonight jim he remarked in a squeaky falsetto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know responded the other man with a shade of annoyance speaking from out an astonishing cataract of red beard that grew fiercely and thickly in all directions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spare man shifted the quill toothpick he was chewing to the other side of his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it aint likely that anybody from the east will come with the corpse i spose he went on reflectively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know responded the other more curtly than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its too bad he didnt belong to some lodge or other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like an order funeral myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seem more appropriate for people of some reputation the spare man continued with an ingratiating concession in his shrill voice as he carefully placed his toothpick in his vest pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he always carried the flag at the g <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the heavy man turned on his heel without replying and walked up the siding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the spare man shuffled back to the uneasy group <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jims ez full ez a tick ez ushel he commented commiseratingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then a distant whistle sounded and there was a shuffling of feet on the platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a number of lanky boys of all ages appeared as suddenly and slimily as eels wakened by the crack of thunder some came from the waiting room where they had been warming themselves by the red stove or halfasleep on the slat benches others uncoiled themselves from baggage trucks or slid out of express wagons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two clambered down from the drivers seat of a hearse that stood backed up against the siding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they straightened their stooping shoulders and lifted their heads and a flash of momentary animation kindled their dull eyes at that cold vibrant scream the worldwide call for men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it stirred them like the note of a trumpet just as it had often stirred the man who was coming home tonight in his boyhood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night express shot red as a rocket from out the eastward marsh lands and wound along the river shore under the long lines of shivering poplars that sentineled the meadows the escaping steam hanging in gray masses against the pale sky and blotting out the milky way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment the red glare from the headlight streamed up the snowcovered track before the siding and glittered on the wet black rails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the burly man with the disheveled red beard walked swiftly up the platform toward the approaching train uncovering his head as he went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the group of men behind him hesitated glanced questioningly at one another and awkwardly followed his example <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train stopped and the crowd shuffled up to the express car just as the door was thrown open the spare man in the g <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suit thrusting his head forward with curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the express messenger appeared in the doorway accompanied by a young man in a long ulster and traveling cap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the group on the platform swayed and shuffled uneasily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philip phelps the banker responded with dignity we have come to take charge of the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> merricks father is very feeble and cant be about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> send the agent out here growled the express messenger and tell the operator to lend a hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coffin was got out of its rough box and down on the snowy platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the townspeople drew back enough to make room for it and then formed a close semicircle about it looking curiously at the palm leaf which lay across the black cover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the baggage man stood by his truck waiting to get at the trunks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the engine panted heavily and the fireman dodged in and out among the wheels with his yellow torch and long oilcan snapping the spindle boxes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young bostonian one of the dead sculptors pupils who had come with the body looked about him helplessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned to the banker the only one of that black uneasy stoopshouldered group who seemed enough of an individual to be addressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man with the red heard for the first time stepped up and joined the group <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no they have not come yet the family is scattered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the body will be taken directly to the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stooped and took hold of one of the handles of the coffin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take the long hill road up thompsonit will be easier on the horses called the liveryman as the undertaker snapped the door of the hearse and prepared to mount to the drivers seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> laird the redbearded lawyer turned again to the stranger we didnt know whether there would be anyone with him or not he explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a long walk so youd better go up in the hack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pointed to a single battered conveyance but the young man replied stiffly thank you but i think i will go up with the hearse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you dont object turning to the undertaker ill ride with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they clambered up over the wheels and drove off in the starlight tip the long white hill toward the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lamps in the still village were shining from under the low snowburdened roofs and beyond on every side the plains reached out into emptiness peaceful and wide as the soft sky itself and wrapped in a tangible white silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the hearse backed up to a wooden sidewalk before a naked weatherbeaten frame house the same composite illdefined group that had stood upon the station siding was huddled about the gate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the front yard was an icy swamp and a couple of warped planks extending from the sidewalk to the door made a sort of rickety footbridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gate hung on one hinge and was opened wide with difficulty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steavens the young stranger noticed that something black was tied to the knob of the front door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grating sound made by the casket as it was drawn from the hearse was answered by a scream from the house the front door was wrenched open and a tall corpulent woman rushed out bareheaded into the snow and flung herself upon the coffin shrieking my boy my boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this is how youve come home to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as steavens turned away and closed his eyes with a shudder of unutterable repulsion another woman also tall but flat and angular dressed entirely in black darted out of the house and caught mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> merrick by the shoulders crying sharply come come mother you mustnt go on like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her tone changed to one of obsequious solemnity as she turned to the banker the parlor is ready mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bearers carried the coffin along the narrow boards while the undertaker ran ahead with the coffinrests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they bore it into a large unheated room that smelled of dampness and disuse and furniture polish and set it down under a hanging lamp ornamented with jingling glass prisms and before a rogers group of john alden and priscilla wreathed with smilax <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry steavens stared about him with the sickening conviction that there had been some horrible mistake and that he had somehow arrived at the wrong destination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked painfully about over the clovergreen brussels the fat plush upholstery among the handpainted china plaques and panels and vases for some mark of identification for something that might once conceivably have belonged to harvey merrick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not until he recognized his friend in the crayon portrait of a little boy in kilts and curls hanging above the piano that he felt willing to let any of these people approach the coffin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thompson let me see my boys face wailed the elder woman between her sobs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time steavens looked fearfully almost beseechingly into her face red and swollen under its masses of strong black shiny hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flushed dropped his eyes and then almost incredulously looked again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a kind of power about her facea kind of brutal handsomeness even but it was scarred and furrowed by violence and so colored and coarsened by fiercer passions that grief seemed never to have laid a gentle finger there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the long nose was distended and knobbed at the end and there were deep lines on either side of it her heavy black brows almost met across her forehead her teeth were large and square and set far apartteeth that could tear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she filled the room the men were obliterated seemed tossed about like twigs in an angry water and even steavens felt himself being drawn into the whirlpool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the daughterthe tall rawboned woman in crepe with a mourning comb in her hair which curiously lengthened her long face sat stiffly upon the sofa her hands conspicuous for their large knuckles folded in her lap her mouth and eyes drawn down solemnly awaiting the opening of the coffin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> near the door stood a mulatto woman evidently a servant in the house with a timid bearing and an emaciated face pitifully sad and gentle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was weeping silently the corner of her calico apron lifted to her eyes occasionally suppressing a long quivering sob <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steavens walked over and stood beside her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> feeble steps were heard on the stairs and an old man tall and frail odorous of pipe smoke with shaggy unkept gray hair and a dingy beard tobacco stained about the mouth entered uncertainly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went slowly up to the coffin and stood rolling a blue cotton handkerchief between his hands seeming so pained and embarrassed by his wifes orgy of grief that he had no consciousness of anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there there annie dear dont take on so he quavered timidly putting out a shaking hand and awkwardly patting her elbow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned with a cry and sank upon his shoulder with such violence that he tottered a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not even glance toward the coffin but continued to look at her with a dull frightened appealing expression as a spaniel looks at the whip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his sunken cheeks slowly reddened and burned with miserable shame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his wife rushed from the room her daughter strode after her with set lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the servant stole up to the coffin bent over it for a moment and then slipped away to the kitchen leaving steavens the lawyer and the father to themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man stood trembling and looking down at his dead sons face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sculptors splendid head seemed even more noble in its rigid stillness than in life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dark hair had crept down upon the wide forehead the face seemed strangely long but in it there was not that beautiful and chaste repose which we expect to find in the faces of the dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the brows were so drawn that there were two deep lines above the beaked nose and the chin was thrust forward defiantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was as though the strain of life had been so sharp and bitter that death could not at once wholly relax the tension and smooth the countenance into perfect peace as though he were still guarding something precious and holy which might even yet be wrested from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old mans lips were working under his stained beard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned to the lawyer with timid deference phelps and the rest are comin back to set up with harve aint they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he brushed the hair back gently from his sons forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a good boy jim always a good boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was ez gentle ez a child and the kindest of em allonly we didnt none of us ever onderstand him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tears trickled slowly down his beard and dropped upon the sculptors coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come here his wife wailed from the top of the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man started timorously yes annie im coming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned away hesitated stood for a moment in miserable indecision then he reached back and patted the dead mans hair softly and stumbled from the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor old man i didnt think he had any tears left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seems as if his eyes would have gone dry long ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at his age nothing cuts very deep remarked the lawyer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> something in his tone made steavens glance up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the mother had been in the room the young man had scarcely seen anyone else but now from the moment he first glanced into jim lairds florid face and bloodshot eyes he knew that he had found what he had been heartsick at not finding beforethe feeling the understanding that must exist in someone even here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man was red as his beard with features swollen and blurred by dissipation and a hot blazing blue eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was strainedthat of a man who is controlling himself with difficultyand he kept plucking at his beard with a sort of fierce resentment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steavens sitting by the window watched him turn down the glaring lamp still its jangling pendants with an angry gesture and then stand with his hands locked behind him staring down into the masters face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not help wondering what link there could have been between the porcelain vessel and so sooty a lump of potters clay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the kitchen an uproar was sounding when the dining room door opened the import of it was clear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother was abusing the maid for having forgotten to make the dressing for the chicken salad which had been prepared for the watchers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> steavens had never heard anything in the least like it it was injured emotional dramatic abuse unique and masterly in its excruciating cruelty as violent and unrestrained as had been her grief of twenty minutes before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a shudder of disgust the lawyer went into the dining room and closed the door into the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor roxys getting it now he remarked when he came back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the merricks took her out of the poorhouse years ago and if her loyalty would let her i guess the poor old thing could tell tales that would curdle your blood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes the mulatto woman who was standing in here a while ago with her apron to her eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old woman is a fury there never was anybody like her for demonstrative piety and ingenious cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made harveys life a hell for him when he lived at home he was so sick ashamed of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never could see how he kept himself so sweet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was wonderful said steavens slowly wonderful but until tonight i have never known how wonderful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is the true and eternal wonder of it anyway that it can come even from such a dung heap as this the lawyer cried with a sweeping gesture which seemed to indicate much more than the four walls within which they stood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think ill see whether i can get a little air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what servile homage these craven creatures did pay these same coach fellows more especially after witnessing this or tother act of brutality practised upon the weak and unoffending upon some poor friendless woman travelling with but little money and perhaps a brace of hungry children with her or upon some thin and halfstarved man travelling on the hind part of the coach from london to liverpool with only eighteen pence in his pocket after his fare was paid to defray his expenses on the road for as the insolence of these knights was vast so was their rapacity enormous they had been so long accustomed to have crowns and halfcrowns rained upon them by their admirers and flatterers that they would look at a shilling for which many an honest labourer was happy to toil for ten hours under a broiling sun with the utmost contempt would blow upon it derisively or fillip it into the air before they pocketed it but when nothing was given them as would occasionally happen for how could they receive from those who had nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and nobody was bound to give them anything as they had certain wages from their employers then what a scene would ensue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> truly the brutality and rapacious insolence of english coachmen had reached a climax it was time that these fellows should be disenchanted and the time thank heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let the craven dastards who used to curry favour with them and applaud their brutality lament their loss now that they and their vehicles have disappeared from the roads i who have ever been an enemy to insolence cruelty and tyranny loathe their memory and what is more am not afraid to say so well aware of the storm of vituperation partly learnt from them which i may expect from those who used to fall down and worship them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amongst the coachmen who frequented the inn was one who was called the bangup coachman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drove to our inn in the fore part of every day one of what were called the fast coaches and afterwards took back the corresponding vehicle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stayed at our house about twenty minutes during which time the passengers of the coach which he was to return with dined those at least who were inclined for dinner and could pay for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he derived his sobriquet of the bangup coachman partly from his being dressed in the extremity of coach dandyism and partly from the peculiar insolence of his manner and the unmerciful fashion in which he was in the habit of lashing on the poor horses committed to his charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a large tall fellow of about thirty with a face which had it not been bloated by excess and insolence and cruelty stamped most visibly upon it might have been called goodlooking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his insolence indeed was so great that he was hated by all the minor fry connected with coaches along the road upon which he drove especially the ostlers whom he was continually abusing or finding fault with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many was the hearty curse which he received when his back was turned but the generality of people were much afraid of him for he was a swinging strong fellow and had the reputation of being a fighter and in one or two instances had beaten in a barbarous manner individuals who had quarrelled with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was nearly having a fracas with this worthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day after he had been drinking sherry with a sprig he swaggered into the yard where i happened to be standing just then a waiter came by carrying upon a tray part of a splendid cheshire cheese with a knife plate and napkin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stopping the waiter the coachman cut with the knife a tolerably large lump out of the very middle of the cheese stuck it on the end of the knife and putting it to his mouth nibbled a slight piece off it and then tossing the rest away with disdain flung the knife down upon the tray motioning the waiter to proceed i wish said i you may not want before you die what you have just flung away whereupon the fellow turned furiously towards me just then however his coach being standing at the door there was a cry for coachman so that he was forced to depart contenting himself for the present with shaking his fist at me and threatening to serve me out on the first opportunity before however the opportunity occurred he himself got served out in a most unexpected manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day after this incident he drove his coach to the inn and after having dismounted and received the contributions of the generality of the passengers he strutted up with a cigar in his mouth to an individual who had come with him and who had just asked me a question with respect to the direction of a village about three miles off to which he was going <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remember the coachman said the knight of the box to this individual who was a thin person of about sixty with a white hat rather shabby black coat and buffcoloured trousers and who held an umbrella and a small bundle in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you expect me to give you anything said he to the coachman you are mistaken i will give you nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have been very insolent to me as i rode behind you on the coach and have encouraged two or three trumpery fellows who rode along with you to cut scurvy jokes at my expense and now you come to me for money i am not so poor but i could have given you a shilling had you been civil as it is i will give you nothing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope i shant starve because you wont give me anything a shilling i why i could afford to give you twenty if i thought fit you pauper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> things are come to a fine pass if i need be civil to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know who you are speaking to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why the best lords in the country are proud to speak to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why it was only the other day that the marquis of said to me and then he went on to say what the marquis said to him after which flinging down his cigar he strutted up the road swearing to himself about paupers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you say it is three miles to said the individual to me i think i shall light my pipe and smoke it as i go along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon he took out from a sidepocket a tobaccobox and short meerschaum pipe and implements for striking a light filled his pipe lighted it and commenced smoking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw at once that there was mischief in his eye the man smoking was standing with his back towards him and he came so nigh to him seemingly purposely that as he passed a puff of smoke came of necessity against his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you mean by smoking in my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he striking the pipe of the elderly individual out of his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other without manifesting much surprise said i thank you and if you will wait a minute i will give you a receipt for that favour then gathering up his pipe and taking off his coat and hat he laid them on a steppingblock which stood near and rubbing his hands together he advanced towards the coachman in an attitude of offence holding his hands crossed very near to his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coachman who probably expected anything but such a movement from a person of the age and appearance of the individual whom he had insulted stood for a moment motionless with surprise but recollecting himself he pointed at him derisively with his finger the next moment however the other was close upon him had struck aside the extended hand with his left fist and given him a severe blow on the nose with his right which he immediately followed by a lefthand blow in the eye then drawing his body slightly backward with the velocity of lightning he struck the coachman full in the mouth and the last blow was the severest of all for it cut the coachmans lips nearly through blows so quickly and sharply dealt i had never seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coachman reeled like a firtree in a gale and seemed nearly unsensed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sounded from a dozen voices and people came running from all directions to see what was going on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coachman coming somewhat to himself disencumbered himself of his coat and hat and encouraged by two or three of his brothers of the whip showed some symptoms of fighting endeavouring to close with his foe but the attempt was vain for his foe was not to be closed with he did not shift or dodge about but warded off the blows of his opponent with the greatest sang froid always using the guard which i have already described and putting in in return short chopping blows with the swiftness of lightning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a very few minutes the countenance of the coachman was literally cut to pieces and several of his teeth were dislodged at length he gave in stung with mortification however he repented and asked for another round it was granted to his own complete demolition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coachman did not drive his coach back that day he did not appear on the box again for a week but he never held up his head afterwards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before i quitted the inn he had disappeared from the road going no one knew where <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coachman as i have said before was very much disliked upon the road but there was an esprit de corps amongst the coachmen and those who stood by did not like to see their brother chastised in such tremendous fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw such a fight before said one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i dont call it a fight at all this chap here hant got a scratch whereas tom is cut to pieces it is all along of that guard of his if tom could have got within his guard he would have soon served the old chap out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he would said another it was all owing to that guard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however i think i see into it and if i had not to drive this afternoon i would have a turn with the old fellow and soon serve him out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will fight him now for a guinea said the other coachman half taking off his coat observing however that the elderly individual made a motion towards him he hitched it upon his shoulder again and added that is if he had not been fighting already but as it is i am above taking an advantage especially of such a poor old creature as that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he had said this he looked around him and there was a feeble titter of approbation from two or three of the craven crew who were in the habit of currying favour with the coachmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elderly individual looked for a moment at these last and then said to such fellows as you i have nothing to say then turning to the coachmen and as for you he said ye cowardly bullies i have but one word which is that your reign upon the roads is nearly over and that a time is coming when ye will no longer be wanted or employed in your present capacity when ye will either have to drive dung carts assist as ostlers at village alehouses or rot in the workhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then putting on his coat and hat and taking up his bundle not forgetting his meerschaum and the rest of his smoking apparatus he departed on his way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> filled with curiosity i followed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am quite astonished that you should be able to use your hands in the way you have done said i as i walked with this individual in the direction in which he was bound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell you how i became able to do so said the elderly individual proceeding to fill and light his pipe as he walked along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my father was a journeyman engraver who lived in a very riotous neighbourhood in the outskirts of london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wishing to give me something of an education he sent me to a dayschool two or three streets distant from where we lived and there being rather a puny boy i suffered much persecution from my schoolfellows who were a very blackguard set <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day as i was running home with one of my tormentors pursuing me old sergeant broughton the retired fightingman seized me by the arm dear me said i has it ever been your luck to be acquainted with sergeant broughton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may well call it luck said the elderly individual but for him i should never have been able to make my way through the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lived only four doors from our house so as i was running along the street with my tyrant behind me sergeant broughton seized me by the arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop my boy said he i have frequently seen that scamp illtreating you now i will teach you how to send him home with a bloody nose down with your bag of books and now my game chick whispered he to me placing himself between me and my adversary so that he could not observe his motions clench your fist in this manner and hold your arms in this and when he strikes at you move them as i now show you and he cant hurt you now dont be afraid but go at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i confess that i was somewhat afraid but i considered myself in some degree under the protection of the famous sergeant and clenching my fist i went at my foe using the guard which my ally recommended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result corresponded to a certain degree with the predictions of the sergeant i gave my foe a bloody nose and a black eye though notwithstanding my recent lesson in the art of selfdefence he contrived to give me two or three clumsy blows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that moment i was the especial favourite of the sergeant who gave me further lessons so that in a little time i became a very fair boxer beating everybody of my own size who attacked me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old gentleman however made me promise never to be quarrelsome nor to turn his instructions to account except in self defence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have always borne in mind my promise and have made it a point of conscience never to fight unless absolutely compelled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> folks may rail against boxing if they please but being able to box may sometimes stand a quiet man in good stead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how should i have fared today but for the instructions of sergeant broughton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for them the brutal ruffian who insulted me must have passed unpunished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will not soon forget the lesson which i have just given him the only lesson he could understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would have been the use of reasoning with a fellow of that description <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and your manner of fighting said i was the manner employed by sergeant broughton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said my new acquaintance it was the manner in which he beat every one who attempted to contend with him till in an evil hour he entered the ring with slack without any training or preparation and by a chance blow lost the battle to a man who had been beaten with ease by those who in the hands of broughton appeared like so many children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the way of fighting of him who first taught englishmen to box scientifically who was the head and father of the fighters of what is now called the old school the last of which were johnson and big ben <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wonderful man that big ben said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was so said the elderly individual but had it not been for broughton i question whether ben would have ever been the fighter he was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no one like old broughton but for him i should at the present moment be sneaking along the road pursued by the hissings and hootings of the dirty flatterers of that blackguard coachman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what did you mean said i by those words of yours that the coachmen would speedily disappear from the roads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meant said he that a new method of travelling is about to be established which will supersede the old <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am a poor engraver as my father was before me but engraving is an intellectual trade and by following it i have been brought in contact with some of the cleverest men in england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it has even made me acquainted with the projector of the scheme which he has told me many of the wisest heads of england have been dreaming of during a period of six hundred years and which it seems was alluded to by a certain brazen head in the storybook of friar bacon who is generally supposed to have been a wizard but in reality was a great philosopher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> young man in less than twenty years by which time i shall be dead and gone england will be surrounded with roads of metal on which armies may travel with mighty velocity and of which the walls of brass and iron by which the friar proposed to defend his native land are the types <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then shaking me by the hand proceeded on his way whilst i returned to the inn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis ardry his misfortunes dog and lion fight great men of the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few days after the circumstance which i have last commemorated it chanced that as i was standing at the door of the inn one of the numerous stagecoaches which were in the habit of stopping there drove up and several passengers got down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had assisted a woman with a couple of children to dismount and had just delivered to her a bandbox which appeared to be her only property which she had begged me to fetch down from the roof when i felt a hand laid upon my shoulder and heard a voice exclaim is it possible old fellow that i find you in this place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned round and wrapped in a large blue cloak i beheld my good friend francis ardry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shook him most warmly by the hand and said if you are surprised to see me i am no less so to see you where are you bound to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am bound for l at any rate i am booked for that sea port said my friend in reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry for it said i for in that case we shall have to part in a quarter of an hour the coach by which you came stopping no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am stopping at present in this house quite undetermined as to what to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then come along with me said francis ardry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i can scarcely do said i i have a horse in the stall which i cannot afford to ruin by racing to l by the side of your coach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friend mused for a moment i have no particular business at l said he i was merely going thither to pass a day or two till an affair in which i am deeply interested at c shall come off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i shall stay with you for fourand twenty hours at least i have been rather melancholy of late and cannot afford to part with a friend like you at the present moment it is an unexpected piece of good fortune to have met you and i have not been very fortunate of late he added sighing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i i am glad to see you once more whether fortunate or not where is your baggage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yon trunk is mine said francis pointing to a trunk of black russian leather upon the coach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will soon have it down said i and at a word which i gave to one of the hangerson of the inn the trunk was taken from the top of the coach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said i to francis ardry follow me i am a person of some authority in this house thereupon i led francis ardry into the house and a word which i said to a waiter forthwith installed francis ardry in a comfortable private sittingroom and his trunk in the very best sleepingroom of our extensive establishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was now about one oclock francis ardry ordered dinner for two to be ready at four and a pint of sherry to be brought forthwith which i requested my friend the waiter might be the very best and which in effect turned out as i requested we sat down and when we had drunk to each others health frank requested me to make known to him how i had contrived to free myself from my embarrassments in london what i had been about since i quitted that city and the present posture of my affairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i related to francis ardry how i had composed the life of joseph sell and how the sale of it to the bookseller had enabled me to quit london with money in my pocket which had supported me during a long course of ramble in the country into the particulars of which i however did not enter with any considerable degree of fulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i summed up my account by saying that i was at present a kind of overlooker in the stables of the inn had still some pounds in my purse and moreover a capital horse in the stall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no very agreeable posture of affairs said francis ardry looking rather seriously at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i make no complaints said i my prospects are not very bright it is true but sometimes i have visions both waking and sleeping which though always strange are invariably agreeable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> last night in my chamber near the hayloft i dreamt that i had passed over an almost interminable wilderness an enormous wall rose before me the wall methought was the great wall of china strange figures appeared to be beckoning to me from the top of the wall such visions are not exactly to be sneered at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that such phantasmagoria said i raising my voice are to be compared for a moment with such desirable things as fashion fine clothes cheques from uncles parliamentary interest the love of splendid females <end> <end> 
<start> <start> womans love said i and sighed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whats the matter with the fellow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing like it said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> confound love said francis ardry i hate the very name i have made myself a pretty fool by it but trust me for ever being at such folly again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an evil hour i abandoned my former pursuits and amusements for it in one morning spent at joeys there was more real pleasure than in surely said i you are not hankering after dogfighting again a sport which none but the gross and unrefined care anything for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no ones thoughts should be occupied by something higher and more rational than dogfighting and what better than love divine love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray dont talk nonsense said francis ardry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nonsense said i why i was repeating to the best of my recollection what i heard you say on a former occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if ever i talked such stuff said francis ardry i was a fool and indeed i cannot deny that i have been one no theres no denying that i have been a fool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that false annette has cruelly abandoned me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i perhaps you have yourself to thank for her having done so did you never treat her with coldness and repay her marks of affectionate interest with strange fits of eccentric humour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how little you know of women said francis ardry had i done as you suppose i should probably have possessed her at the present moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i treated her in a manner diametrically opposite to that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i loaded her with presents was always most assiduous to her always at her feet as i may say yet she nevertheless abandoned me and for whom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am almost ashamed to say for a fiddler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took a glass of wine francis ardry followed my example and then proceeded to detail to me the treatment which he had experienced from annette and from what he said it appeared that her conduct to him had been in the highest degree reprehensible notwithstanding he had indulged her in everything she was never civil to him but loaded him continually with taunts and insults and had finally on his being unable to supply her with a sum of money which she had demanded decamped from the lodgings which he had taken for her carrying with her all the presents which at various times he had bestowed upon her and had put herself under the protection of a gentleman who played the bassoon at the italian opera at which place it appeared that her sister had lately been engaged as a danseuse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friend informed me that at first he had experienced great agony at the ingratitude of annette but at last had made up his mind to forget her and in order more effectually to do so had left london with the intention of witnessing a fight which was shortly coming off at a town in these parts between some dogs and a lion which combat he informed me had for some time past been looked forward to with intense eagerness by the gentlemen of the sporting world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i commended him for his resolution at the same time advising him not to give up his mind entirely to dogfighting as he had formerly done but when the present combat should be over to return to his rhetorical studies and above all to marry some rich and handsome lady on the first opportunity as with his person and expectations he had only to sue for the hand of the daughter of a marquis to be successful telling him with a sigh that all women were not annettes and that upon the whole there was nothing like them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to which advice he answered that he intended to return to rhetoric as soon as the lion fight should be over but that he never intended to marry having had enough of women adding that he was glad he had no sister as with the feelings which he entertained with respect to her sex he should be unable to treat her with common affection and concluded by repeating a proverb which he had learnt from an arab whom he had met at venice to the effect that one who has been stung by a snake shivers at the sight of a sting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a little more conversation we strolled to the stable where my horse was standing my friend who was a connoisseur in horseflesh surveyed the animal with attention and after inquiring where and how i had obtained him asked what i intended to do with him on my telling him that i was undetermined and that i was afraid the horse was likely to prove a burden to me he said it is a noble animal and if you mind what you are about you may make a small fortune by him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not want such an animal myself nor do i know any one who does but a great horsefair will be held shortly at a place where it is true i have never been but of which i have heard a great deal from my acquaintances where it is said a firstrate horse is always sure to fetch its value that place is horncastle in lincolnshire you should take him thither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis ardry and myself dined together and after dinner partook of a bottle of the best port which the inn afforded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a few glasses we had a great deal of conversation i again brought the subject of marriage and love divine love upon the carpet but francis almost immediately begged me to drop it and on my having the delicacy to comply he reverted to dogfighting on which he talked well and learnedly amongst other things he said it was a princely sport of great antiquity and quoted from quintus curtius to prove that the princes of india must have been of the fancy they having according to that author treated alexander to a fight between certain dogs and a lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> becoming notwithstanding my friends eloquence and learning somewhat tired of the subject i began to talk about alexander <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis ardry said he was one of the two great men whom the world has produced the other being napoleon i replied that i believed tamerlane was a greater man than either but francis ardry knew nothing of tamerlane save what he had gathered from the play of timour the tartar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said he alexander and napoleon are the great men of the world their names are known everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alexander has been dead upwards of two thousand years but the very english bumpkins sometimes christen their boys by the name of alexander can there be a greater evidence of his greatness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for napoleon there are some parts of india in which his bust is worshipped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wishing to make up a triumvirate i mentioned the name of wellington to which francis ardry merely said bah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and resumed the subject of dogfighting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> francis ardry remained at the inn during that day and the next and then departed to the dog and lion fight i never saw him afterwards and merely heard of him once after a lapse of some years and what i then heard was not exactly what i could have wished to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not make much of the advantages which he possessed a pity for how great were those advantages person intellect eloquence connection riches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet with all these advantages one thing highly needful seems to have been wanting in francis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a desire a craving to perform something great and good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a vast deal may be done with intellect courage riches accompanied by the desire of doing something great and good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why a person may carry the blessings of civilization and religion to barbarous yet at the same time beautiful and romantic lands and what a triumph there is for him who does so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of far greater value than those surrounding the brows of your mere conquerors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet who has done so in these times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not many not three not two something seems to have been always wanting there is however one instance in which the various requisites have been united and the crown the most desirable in the world at least which i consider to be the most desirable achieved and only one that of brooke of borneo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude and the man in black the postillions adventures the lone house a goodly assemblage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it never rains but it pours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was destined to see at this inn more acquaintances than one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the day of francis ardrys departure shortly after he had taken leave of me as i was standing in the cornchamber at a kind of writing table or desk fastened to the wall with a book before me in which i was making out an account of the corn and hay lately received and distributed my friend the postillion came running in out of breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here they both are he gasped out pray do come and look at them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why that redhaired jack priest and that idiotic parson platitude they have just been set down by one of the coaches and want a postchaise to go across the country in and what do you think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am to have the driving of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no time to lose for i must get myself ready so do come and look at them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hastened into the yard of the inn two or three of the helpers of our establishment were employed in drawing forward a postchaise out of the chaisehouse which occupied one side of the yard and which was spacious enough to contain nearly twenty of these vehicles though it was never full several of them being always out upon the roads as the demand upon us for postchaises across the country was very great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there they are said the postillion softly nodding towards two individuals in one of whom i recognized the man in black and in the other mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude there they are have a good look at them while i go and get ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man in black and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude were walking up and down the yard mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude was doing his best to make himself appear ridiculous talking very loudly in exceedingly bad italian evidently for the purpose of attracting the notice of the bystanders in which he succeeded all the stableboys and hangerson about the yard attracted by his vociferation grinning at his ridiculous figure as he limped up and down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man in black said little or nothing but from the glances which he cast sideways appeared to be thoroughly ashamed of his companion the worthy couple presently arrived close to where i was standing and the man in black who was nearest to me perceiving me stood still as if hesitating but recovering himself in a moment he moved on without taking any farther notice mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude exclaimed as they passed in broken lingo i hope we shall find the holy doctors all assembled and as they returned i make no doubt that they will all be rejoiced to see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not wishing to be standing an idle gazer i went to the chaise and assisted in attaching the horses which had now been brought out to the pole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the postillion presently arrived and finding all ready took the reins and mounted the box whilst i very politely opened the door for the two travellers mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude got in first and without taking any notice of me seated himself on the farther side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in got the man in black and seated himself nearest to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all is right said i as i shut the door whereupon the postillion cracked his whip and the chaise drove out of the yard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as i shut the door however and just as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude had recommenced talking in jergo at the top of his voice the man in black turned his face partly towards me and gave me a wink with his left eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not see my friend the postillion till the next morning when he gave me an account of the adventures he had met with on his expedition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeared that he had driven the man in black and the reverend platitude across the country by roads and lanes which he had some difficulty in threading <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length when he had reached a part of the country where he had never been before the man in black pointed out to him a house near the corner of a wood to which he informed him they were bound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the postillion said it was a strange looking house with a wall round it and upon the whole bore something of the look of a madhouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was already a postchaise at the gate from which three individuals had alighted one of them the postillion said was a meanlooking scoundrel with a regular pettylarceny expression in his countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was dressed very much like the man in black and the postillion said that he could almost have taken his bible oath that they were both of the same profession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other two he said were parsons he could swear that though he had never seen them before there could be no mistake about them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> church of england parsons the postillion swore they were with their black coats white cravats and airs in which clumsiness and conceit were most funnily blended church of england parsons of the platitude description who had been in italy and seen the pope and kissed his toe and picked up a little broken italian and come home greater fools than they went forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeared that they were all acquaintances of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude for when the postillion had alighted and let mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude and his companion out of the chaise mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> platitude shook the whole three by the hand conversed with his two brothers in a little broken jergo and addressed the pettylarceny looking individual by the title of reverend doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the midst of these greetings however the postillion said the man in black came up to him and proceeded to settle with him for the chaise he had shaken hands with nobody and had merely nodded to the others and now said the postillion he evidently wished to get rid of me fearing probably that i should see too much of the nonsense that was going on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was whilst settling with me that he seemed to recognize me for the first time for he stared hard at me and at last asked whether i had not been in italy to which question with a nod and a laugh i replied that i had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was then going to ask him about the health of the image of holy mary and to say that i hoped it had recovered from its horsewhipping but he interrupted me paid me the money for the fare and gave me a crown for myself saying he would not detain me any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say partner i am a poor postillion but when he gave me the crown i had a good mind to fling it in his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reflected however that it was not mere giftmoney but coin which i had earned and hardly too so i put it in my pocket and i bethought me moreover that knave as i knew him to be he had always treated me with civility so i nodded to him and he said something which perhaps he meant for latin but which sounded very much like vails and by which he doubtless alluded to the money which he had given me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then went into the house with the rest the coach drove away which had brought the others and i was about to get on the box and follow observing however two more chaises driving up i thought i would be in no hurry so i just led my horses and chaise a little out of the way and pretending to be occupied about the harness i kept a tolerably sharp lookout at the new arrivals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well partner the next vehicle that drove up was a gentlemans carriage which i knew very well as well as those within it who were a father and son the father a good kind old gentleman and a justice of the peace therefore not very wise as you may suppose the son a puppy who has been abroad where he contrived to forget his own language though only nine months absent and now rules the roast over his father and mother whose only child he is and by whom he is thought wondrous clever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so this foreigneering chap brings his poor old father to this outoftheway house to meet these platitudes and pettylarceny villains and perhaps would have brought his mother too only simple thing by good fortune she happens to be laid up with the rheumatic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well the father and son i beg pardon i mean the son and father got down and went in and then after their carriage was gone the chaise behind drove up in which was a huge fat fellow weighing twenty stone at least but with something of a foreign look and with him who do you think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why a rascally unitarian minister that is a fellow who had been such a minister but who some years ago leaving his own people who had bred him up and sent him to their college at york went over to the high church and is now i suppose going over to some other church for he was talking as he got down wondrous fast in latin or what sounded something like latin to the fat fellow who appeared to take things wonderfully easy and merely grunted to the dog latin which the scoundrel had learnt at the expense of the poor unitarians at york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they went into the house and presently arrived another chaise but ere i could make any further observations the porter of the outoftheway house came up to me asking what i was stopping there for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bidding me go away and not pry into other peoples business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pretty business said i to him that is being transacted in a place like this and then i was going to say something uncivil but he went to attend to the new corners and i took myself away on my own business as he bade me not however before observing that these two last were a couple of blackcoats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the postillion then proceeded to relate how he made the best of his way to a small publichouse about a mile off where he had intended to bait and how he met on the way a landau and pair belonging to a scotch coxcomb whom he had known in london about whom he related some curious particulars and then continued well after i had passed him and his turn out i drove straight to the publichouse where i baited my horses and where i found some of the chaises and drivers who had driven the folks to the lunaticlooking mansion and were now waiting to take them up again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whilst my horses were eating their bait i sat me down as the weather was warm at a table outside and smoked a pipe and drank some ale in company with the coachman of the old gentleman who had gone to the house with his son and the coachman then told me that the house was a papist house and that the present was a grand meeting of all the fools and rascals in the country who came to bow down to images and to concert schemes pretty schemes no doubt for overturning the religion of the country and that for his part he did not approve of being concerned with such doings and that he was going to give his master warning next day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so as we were drinking and discoursing up drove the chariot of the scotchman and down got his valet and the driver and whilst the driver was seeing after the horses the valet came and sat down at the table where the gentlemans coachman and i were drinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew the fellow well a scotchman like his master and just of the same kidney with white kid gloves red hair frizzled a patch of paint on his face and his hands covered with rings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this very fellow i must tell you was one of those most busy in endeavouring to get me turned out of the servants club in park lane because i happened to serve a literary man so he sat down and in a kind of affected tone cried out landlord bring me a glass of cold negus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlord however told him that there was no negus but that if he pleased he could have a jug of as good beer as any in the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> confound the beer said the valet do you think that i am accustomed to such vulgar beverage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however as he found there was nothing better to be had he let the man bring him some beer and when he had got it soon showed that he could drink it easily enough so when he had drunk two or three draughts he turned his eyes in a contemptuous manner first on the coachman and then on me i saw the scamp recollected me for after staring at me and my dress for about half a minute he put on a broad grin and flinging his head back he uttered a loud laugh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i did not like this as you may well believe and taking the pipe out of my mouth i asked him if he meant anything personal to which he answered that he had said nothing to me and that he had a right to look where he pleased and laugh when he pleased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well as to a certain extent he was right as to looking and laughing and as i have occasionally looked at a fool and laughed though i was not the fool in this instance i put my pipe into my mouth and said no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this quiet and wellregulated behaviour of mine however the fellow interpreted into fear so after drinking a little more he suddenly started up and striding once or twice before the table he asked me what i meant by that impertinent question of mine saying that he had a good mind to wring my nose for my presumption <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i getting up and laying down my pipe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well ill now give you an opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i put myself in an attitude and went up to him saying i have an old score to settle with you you scamp you wanted to get me turned out of the club didnt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thereupon remembering that he had threatened to wring my nose i gave him a snorter upon his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you could have seen the fellow when he felt the smart so far from trying to defend himself he turned round and with his hand to his face attempted to run away but i was now in a regular passion and following him up got before him and was going to pummel away at him when he burst into tears and begged me not to hurt him saying that he was sorry if he had offended me and that if i pleased he would go down on his knees or do anything else i wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well when i heard him talk in this manner i of course let him be i could hardly help laughing at the figure he cut his face all blubbered with tears and blood and paint but i did not laugh at the poor creature either but went to the table and took up my pipe and smoked and drank as if nothing had happened and the fellow after having been to the pump came and sat down crying and trying to curry favour with me and the coachman presently however putting on a confidential look he began to talk of the popish house and of the doings there and said he supposed as how we were of the party and that it was all right and then he began to talk of the pope of rome and what a nice man he was and what a fine thing it was to be of his religion especially if folks went over to him and how it advanced them in the world and gave them consideration and how his master who had been abroad and seen the pope and kissed his toe was going over to the popish religion and had persuaded him to consent to do so and to forsake his own which i think the scoundrel called the piscopal church of scotland and how many others of that church were going over thinking to better their condition in life by so doing and to be more thought on and how many of the english church were thinking of going over too and that he had no doubt that it would all end right and comfortably <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well as he was going on in this way the old coachman began to spit and getting up flung all the beer that was in his jug upon the ground and going away ordered another jug of beer and sat down at another table saying that he would not drink in such company and i too got up and flung what beer remained in my jug there wasnt more than a drop in the fellows face saying i would scorn to drink any more in such company and then i went to my horses put them to paid my reckoning and drove home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the postillion having related his story to which i listened with all due attention mused for a moment and then said i dare say you remember how some time since when old bill had been telling us how the government a long time ago had done away with robbing on the highway by putting down the public houses and places which the highwaymen frequented and by sending a good mounted police to hunt them down i said that it was a shame that the present government did not employ somewhat the same means in order to stop the proceedings of mumbo jumbo and his gang nowadays in england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> howsomever since i have driven a fare to a popish rendezvous and seen something of what is going on there i should conceive that the government are justified in allowing the gang the free exercise of their calling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anybody is welcome to stoop and pick up nothing or worse than nothing and if mumbo jumbos people after their expeditions return to their haunts with no better plunder in the shape of converts than what i saw going into yonder place of call i should say they are welcome to what they get for if thats the kind of rubbish they steal out of the church of england or any other church who in his senses but would say a good riddance and many thanks for your trouble at any rate that is my opinion of the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deliberations with selfresolution invitation to dinner the commercial traveller the landlords offer the comet wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was now that i had frequent deliberations with myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should i continue at the inn in my present position <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not very much captivated with it there was little poetry in keeping an account of the corn hay and straw which came in and was given out and i was fond of poetry moreover there was no glory at all to be expected in doing so and i was fond of glory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should i give up that situation and remaining at the inn become ostler under old bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was more poetry in rubbing down horses than in keeping an account of straw hay and corn there was also some prospect of glory attached to the situation of ostler for the grooms and stableboys occasionally talked of an ostler a great way down the road who had been presented by some sporting people not with a silver vase as our governor had been but with a silver currycomb in testimony of their admiration for his skill but i confess that the poetry of rubbing down had become as all other poetry becomes rather prosy by frequent repetition and with respect to the chance of deriving glory from the employment i entertained in the event of my determining to stay very slight hope of ever attaining skill in the ostler art sufficient to induce sporting people to bestow upon me a silver currycomb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was not half so good an ostler as old bill who had never been presented with a silver currycomb and i never expected to become so therefore what chance had i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was true there was a prospect of some pecuniary emolument to be derived by remaining in either situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was very probable that provided i continued to keep an account of the hay and corn coming in and expended the landlord would consent to allow me a pound a week which at the end of a dozen years provided i kept myself sober would amount to a considerable sum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might on the retirement of old bill by taking his place save up a decent sum of money provided unlike him i kept myself sober and laid by all the shillings and sixpences i got but the prospect of laying up a decent sum of money was not of sufficient importance to induce me to continue either at my wooden desk or in the innyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reader will remember what difficulty i had to make up my mind to become a merchant under the armenians auspices even with the prospect of making two or three hundred thousand pounds by following the armenian way of doing business so it was not probable that i should feel disposed to be a bookkeeper or ostler all my life with no other prospect than being able to make a tidy sum of money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if indeed besides the prospect of making a tidy sum at the end of perhaps forty years ostlering i had been certain of being presented with a silver currycomb with my name engraved upon it which i might have left to my descendants or in default thereof to the parish church destined to contain my bones with directions that it might be soldered into the wall above the arch leading from the body of the church into the chancel i will not say with such a certainty of immortality combined with such a prospect of moderate pecuniary advantage i might not have thought it worth my while to stay but i entertained no such certainty and taking everything into consideration i determined to mount my horse and leave the inn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this horse had caused me for some time past no little perplexity i had frequently repented of having purchased him more especially as the purchase had been made with another persons money and had more than once shown him to people who i imagined were likely to purchase him but though they were profuse in his praise as people generally are in the praise of what they dont intend to purchase they never made me an offer and now that i had determined to mount on his back and ride away what was i to do with him in the sequel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not maintain him long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly i bethought me of horncastle which francis ardry had mentioned as a place where the horse was likely to find a purchaser and not having determined upon any particular place to which to repair i thought that i could do no better than betake myself to horncastle in the first instance and there endeavour to dispose of my horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on making inquiries with respect to the situation of horncastle and the time when the fair would be held i learned that the town was situated in lincolnshire about a hundred and fifty miles from the inn at which i was at present sojourning and that the fair would be held nominally within about a month but that it was always requisite to be on the spot some days before the nominal day of the fair as all the best horses were generally sold before that time and the people who came to purchase gone away with what they had bought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people of the inn were very sorry on being informed of my determination to depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old bill told me that he had hoped as how i had intended to settle down there and to take his place as ostler when he was fit for no more work adding that though i did not know much of the business yet he had no doubt but that i might improve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friend the postillion was particularly sorry and taking me with him to the tap room called for two pints of beer to one of which he treated me and whilst we were drinking told me how particularly sorry he was at the thought of my going but that he hoped i should think better of the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on my telling him that i must go he said that he trusted i should put off my departure for three weeks in order that i might be present at his marriage the banns of which were just about to be published <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to see me dance a minuet with his wife after the marriage dinner but i told him it was impossible that i should stay my affairs imperatively calling me elsewhere and that with respect to my dancing a minuet such a thing was out of the question as i had never learned to dance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at which he said that he was exceedingly sorry and finding me determined to go wished me success in all my undertakings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the master of the house to whom as in duty bound i communicated my intention before i spoke of it to the servants was i make no doubt very sorry though he did not exactly tell me so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he said was that he had never expected that i should remain long there as such a situation never appeared to him quite suitable to me though i had been very diligent and had given him perfect satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his inquiring when i intended to depart i informed him next day whereupon he begged that i would defer my departure till the next day but one and do him the favour of dining with him on the morrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i informed him that i should be only too happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the following day at four oclock i dined with the landlord in company with a commercial traveller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dinner was good though plain consisting of boiled mackerel rather a rarity in those parts at that time with fennel sauce a prime baron of roast beef after the mackerel then a tart and noble cheshire cheese we had prime sherry at dinner and whilst eating the cheese prime porter that of barclay the only good porter in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the cloth was removed we had a bottle of very good port and whilst partaking of the port i had an argument with the commercial traveller on the subject of the cornlaws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the commercial traveller having worsted me in the argument on the subject of the cornlaws got up in great glee saying that he must order his gig as business must be attended to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before leaving the room however he shook me patronizingly by the hand and said something to the master of the house but in so low a tone that it escaped my ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner had he departed than the master of the house told me that his friend the traveller had just said that i was a confounded sensible young fellow and not at all opinionated a sentiment in which he himself perfectly agreed then hemming once or twice he said that as i was going on a journey he hoped i was tolerably well provided with money adding that travelling was rather expensive especially on horseback the manner in which he supposed as i had a horse in the stable i intended to travel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him that though i was not particularly well supplied with money i had sufficient for the expenses of my journey at the end of which i hoped to procure more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then hemmed again and said that since i had been at the inn i had rendered him a great deal of service in more ways than one and that he should not think of permitting me to depart without making me some remuneration then putting his hand into his waistcoat pocket he handed me a cheque for ten pounds which he had prepared beforehand the value of which he said i could receive at the next town or that if i wished it any waiter in the house would cash it for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thanked him for his generosity in the best terms i could select but handing him back the cheque i told him that i could not accept it saying that so far from his being my debtor i believed myself to be indebted to him as not only myself but my horse had been living at his house for several weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he replied that as for my board at a house like his it amounted to nothing and as for the little corn and hay which the horse had consumed it was of no consequence and that he must insist upon my taking the cheque <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i again declined telling him that doing so would be a violation of a rule which i had determined to follow and which nothing but the greatest necessity would ever compel me to break through never to incur obligations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but said he receiving this money will not be incurring an obligation it is your due <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think so said i i did not engage to serve you for money nor will i take any from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps you will take it as a loan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i replied i never borrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said the landlord smiling you are different from all others that i am acquainted with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never yet knew any one else who scrupled to borrow and receive obligations why there are two baronets in the neighbourhood who have borrowed money of me ay and who have never repaid what they borrowed and there are a dozen squires who are under considerable obligations to me who i dare say will never return them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come you need not be more scrupulous than your superiors i mean in station <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every vessel must stand on its own bottom said i they take pleasure in receiving obligations i take pleasure in being independent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps they are wise and i am a fool i know not but one thing i am certain of which is that were i not independent i should be very unhappy i should have no visions then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the landlord looking at me compassionately excuse me but i dont think you are exactly fit to take care of yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there you are mistaken said i i can take precious good care of myself ay and can drive a precious hard bargain when i have occasion but driving bargains is a widely different thing from receiving gifts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going to take my horse to horncastle and when there i shall endeavour to obtain his full value ay to the last penny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the landlord i have heard of that place you mustnt be dreaming visions when you get there or theyll steal the horse from under you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said he rising i shall not press you further on the subject of the cheque <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i intend however to put you under an obligation to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then rang the bell and having ordered two fresh glasses to be brought he went out and presently returned with a small pint bottle which he uncorked with his own hand then sitting down he said the wine that i bring here is port of eighteen hundred and eleven the year of the comet the best vintage on record the wine which we have been drinking he added is good but not to be compared with this which i never sell and which i am chary of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you have drunk some of it i think you will own that i have conferred an obligation upon you he then filled the glasses the wine which he poured out diffusing an aroma through the room then motioning me to drink he raised his own glass to his lips saying come friend i drink to your success at horncastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> triumphal departure no season like youth extreme old age beautiful england the ratcatcher a misadventure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i departed from the inn much in the same fashion as i had come to it mounted on a splendid horse indifferently well caparisoned with the small valise attached to my crupper in which besides the few things i had brought with me was a small book of roads with a map which had been presented to me by the landlord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must not forget to state that i did not ride out of the yard but that my horse was brought to me at the front door by old bill who insisted upon doing so and who refused a fiveshilling piece which i offered him and it will be as well to let the reader know that the landlord shook me by the hand as i mounted and that the people attached to the inn male and female my friend the postillion at the head assembled before the house to see me off and gave me three cheers as i rode away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps no person ever departed from an inn with more eclat or better wishes nobody looked at me askance except two stage coachmen who were loitering about one of whom said to his companion i say jim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a regular newmarket turnout by  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in the cool of the evening of a bright day all the days of that summer were bright that i departed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt at first rather melancholy at finding myself again launched into the wide world and leaving the friends whom i had lately made behind me but by occasionally trotting the horse and occasionally singing a song of romanvile i had dispelled the feeling of melancholy by the time i had proceeded three miles down the main road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was at the end of these three miles just opposite a milestone that i struck into a cross road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after riding about seven miles threading what are called in postillion parlance crosscountry roads i reached another high road tending to the east along which i proceeded for a mile or two when coming to a small inn about nine oclock i halted and put up for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> early on the following morning i proceeded on my journey but fearing to gall the horse i no longer rode him but led him by the bridle until i came to a town at the distance of about ten miles from the place where i had passed the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here i stayed during the heat of the day more on the horses account than my own and towards evening resumed my journey leading the animal by the bridle as before and in this manner i proceeded for several days travelling on an average from twenty to twentyfive miles a day always leading the animal except perhaps now and then of an evening when if i saw a good piece of road before me i would mount and put the horse into a trot which the creature seemed to enjoy as much as myself showing his satisfaction by snorting and neighing whilst i gave utterance to my own exhilaration by shouts or by the chi she is kaulo she soves pre lakie dumo or by something else of the same kind in romanvile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the whole i journeyed along very pleasantly certainly quite as pleasantly as i do at present now that i am become a gentleman and weigh sixteen stone though some people would say that my present manner of travelling is much the most preferable riding as i now do instead of leading my horse receiving the homage of ostlers instead of their familiar nods sitting down to dinner in the parlour of the best inn i can find instead of passing the brightest part of the day in the kitchen of a village alehouse carrying on my argument after dinner on the subject of the cornlaws with the best commercial gentlemen on the road instead of being glad whilst sipping a pint of beer to get into conversation with blind trampers or maimed abraham sailors regaling themselves on halfpints at the said village hostelries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many people will doubtless say that things have altered wonderfully with me for the better and they would say right provided i possessed now what i then carried about with me in my journeys the spirit of youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youth is the only season for enjoyment and the first twentyfive years of ones life are worth all the rest of the longest life of man even though those fiveandtwenty be spent in penury and contempt and the rest in the possession of wealth honours respectability ay and many of them in strength and health such as will enable one to ride forty miles before dinner and over ones pint of port for the best gentleman in the land should not drink a bottle carry on ones argument with gravity and decorum with any commercial gentleman who responsive to ones challenge takes the part of humanity and common sense against protection and the lord of the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is nothing like youth not that afterlife is valueless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even in extreme old age one may get on very well provided we will but accept of the bounties of god <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i met the other day an old man who asked me to drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not thirsty said i and will not drink with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes you will said the old man for i am this day one hundred years old and you will never again have an opportunity of drinking the health of a man on his hundredth birthday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i broke my word and drank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yours is a wonderful age said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a long time to look back to the beginning of it said the old man yet upon the whole i am not sorry to have lived it all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how have you passed your time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as well as i could said the old man always enjoying a good thing when it came honestly within my reach not forgetting to praise god for putting it there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you were fond of a glass of good ale when you were young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the old man i was and so thank god i am still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he drank off a glass of ale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on i went in my journey traversing england from west to east ascending and descending hills crossing rivers by bridge and ferry and passing over extensive plains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a beautiful country is england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people run abroad to see beautiful countries and leave their own behind unknown unnoticed their own the most beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then again what a country for adventures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> especially to those who travel on foot or on horseback <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people run abroad in quest of adventures and traverse spain or portugal on mule or on horseback whereas there are ten times more adventures to be met with in england than in spain portugal or stupid germany to boot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> witness the number of adventures narrated in the present book a book entirely devoted to england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why there is not a chapter in the present book which is not full of adventures with the exception of the present one and this is not yet terminated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after traversing two or three counties i reached the confines of lincolnshire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during one particularly hot day i put up at a publichouse to which in the evening came a party of harvesters to make merry who finding me wandering about the house a stranger invited me to partake of their ale so i drank with the harvesters who sang me songs about sitting in the swale and listening to the swindle of the flail as it sounds dubadub on the corn from the neighbouring barn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in requital for which i treated them with a song not of romanvile but the song of sivory and the horse grayman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remained with them till it was dark having after sunset entered into deep discourse with a celebrated ratcatcher who communicated to me the secrets of his trade saying amongst other things when you see the rats pouring out of their holes and running up my hands and arms its not after me they comes but after the oils i carries about me they comes and who subsequently spoke in the most enthusiastic manner of his trade saying that it was the best trade in the world and most diverting and that it was likely to last for ever for whereas all other kinds of vermin were fast disappearing from england rats were every day becoming more abundant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had quitted this good company and having mounted my horse was making my way towards a town at about six miles distance at a swinging trot my thoughts deeply engaged on what i had gathered from the ratcatcher when all on a sudden a light glared upon the horses face who purled round in great terror and flung me out of the saddle as from a sling or with as much violence as the horse grayman in the ballad flings sivord the snareswayne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fell upon the ground felt a kind of crashing about my neck and forthwith became senseless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a novel situation the elderly individual the surgeon a kind offer chimerical ideas strange dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long i remained senseless i cannot say for a considerable time i believe at length opening my eyes i found myself lying on a bed in a middlesized chamber lighted by a candle which stood on a table an elderly man stood near me and a yet more elderly female was holding a phial of very pungent salts to my olfactory organ <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i attempted to move but felt very stiff my right arm appeared nearly paralysed and there was a strange dull sensation in my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you had better remain still young man said the elderly individual the surgeon will be here presently i have sent a message for him to the neighbouring village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i and what has happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are in my house said the old man and you have been flung from a horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry to say that i was the cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i was driving home the lights in my gig frightened the animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> below in my stable said the elderly individual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw you fall but knowing that on account of my age i could be of little use to you i instantly hurried home the accident did not occur more than a furlong off and procuring the assistance of my lad and two or three neighbouring cottagers i returned to the spot where you were lying senseless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we raised you up and brought you here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lad then went in quest of the horse who had run away as we drew nigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we saw him first he was standing near you he caught him with some difficulty and brought him home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the old man as i strove to get off the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to see the horse said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i entreat you to be still said the old man the horse is safe i assure you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am thinking about his knees said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of thinking about your horses knees said the old man be thankful that you have not broke your own neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do not talk wisely said i when a mans neck is broke he is provided for but when his horses knees are broke he is a lost jockey that is if he has nothing but his horse to depend upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pretty figure i should cut at horncastle mounted on a horse bloodraw at the knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh you are going to horncastle said the old man seriously then i can sympathize with you in your anxiety about your horse being a lincolnshire man and the son of one who bred horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will myself go down into the stable and examine into the condition of your horse so pray remain quiet till i return it would certainly be a terrible thing to appear at horncastle on a brokenkneed horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left the room and returned in about ten minutes followed by another person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> your horse is safe said he and his knees are unblemished not a hair ruffled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a fine animal and will do credit to horncastle but here is the surgeon come to examine into your own condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon was a man about thirtyfive thin and rather tall his face was long and pale and his hair which was light was carefully combed back as much as possible from his forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was dressed very neatly and spoke in a very precise tone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allow me to feel your pulse friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he taking me by the right wrist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i uttered a cry for at the motion which he caused a thrill of agony darted through my arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope your arm is not broke my friend said the surgeon allow me to see first of all we must divest you of this cumbrous frock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the frock was removed with some difficulty and then the upper vestments of my frame with more difficulty still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon felt my arm moving it up and down causing me unspeakable pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no fracture said he at last but a contusion a violent contusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am told you were going to horncastle i am afraid you will be hardly able to ride your horse thither in time to dispose of him however we shall see your arm must be bandaged friend after which i shall bleed you and administer a composing draught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be short the surgeon did as he proposed and when he had administered the composing draught he said be of good cheer i should not be surprised if you are yet in time for horncastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then departed with the master of the house and the woman leaving me to my repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i soon began to feel drowsy and was just composing myself to slumber lying on my back as the surgeon had advised me when i heard steps ascending the stairs and in a moment more the surgeon entered again followed by the master of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope i dont disturb you said the former my reason for returning is to relieve your mind from any anxiety with respect to your horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am by no means sure that you will be able owing to your accident to reach horncastle in time to quiet you however i will buy your horse for any reasonable sum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been down to the stable and approve of his figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you ask for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a strange time of night said i to come to me about purchasing my horse and i am hardly in a fitting situation to be applied to about such a matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you want him for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my own use said the surgeon i am a professional man and am obliged to be continually driving about i cover at least one hundred and fifty miles every week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he will never answer your purpose said i he is not a driving horse and was never between shafts in his life he is for riding more especially for trotting at which he has few equals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it matters not to me whether he is for riding or driving said the surgeon sometimes i ride sometimes drive so if we can come to terms i will buy him though remember it is chiefly to remove any anxiety from your mind about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is no time for bargaining said i if you wish to have the horse for a hundred guineas you may if not a hundred guineas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the surgeon my good friend you must surely be lightheaded allow me to feel your pulse and he attempted to feel my left wrist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not lightheaded said i and i require no one to feel my pulse but i should be lightheaded if i were to sell my horse for less than i have demanded but i have a curiosity to know what you would be willing to offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thirty pounds said the surgeon is all i can afford to give and that is a great deal for a country surgeon to offer for a horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i why he cost me nearly double that sum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to tell you the truth i am afraid that you want to take advantage of my situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not in the least friend said the surgeon not in the least i only wished to set your mind at rest about your horse but as you think he is worth more than i can afford to offer take him to horncastle by all means i will do my best to cure you in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good night i will see you again on the morrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon he once more departed with the master of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sharp one i heard him say with a laugh as the door closed upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> left to myself i again essayed to compose myself to rest but for some time in vain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been terribly shaken by my fall and had subsequently owing to the incision of the surgeons lancet been deprived of much of the vital fluid it is when the body is in such a state that the merest trifles affect and agitate the mind no wonder then that the return of the surgeon and the master of the house for the purpose of inquiring whether i would sell my horse struck me as being highly extraordinary considering the hour of the night and the situation in which they knew me to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what could they mean by such conduct did they wish to cheat me of the animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well well said i if they did what matters they found their match yes yes said i but i am in their power perhaps but i instantly dismissed the apprehension which came into my mind with a pooh nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a little time however a far more foolish and chimerical idea began to disturb me the idea of being flung from my horse was i not disgraced for ever as a horseman by being flung from my horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> assuredly i thought and the idea of being disgraced as a horseman operating on my nervous system caused me very acute misery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all said i to myself it was perhaps the contemptible opinion which the surgeon must have formed of my equestrian powers which induced him to offer to take my horse off my hands he perhaps thought i was unable to manage a horse and therefore in pity returned in the dead of night to offer to purchase the animal which had flung me and then the thought that the surgeon had conceived a contemptible opinion of my equestrian powers caused me the acutest misery and continued tormenting me until some other idea i have forgot what it was but doubtless equally foolish took possession of my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length brought on by the agitation of my spirits there came over me the same feeling of horror that i had experienced of old when i was a boy and likewise of late within the dingle it was however not so violent as it had been on those occasions and i struggled manfully against it until by degrees it passed away and then i fell asleep and in my sleep i had an ugly dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dreamt that i had died of the injuries i had received from my fall and that no sooner had my soul departed from my body than it entered that of a quadruped even my own horse in the stable in a word i was to all intents and purposes my own steed and as i stood in the stable chewing hay and i remember that the hay was exceedingly tough the door opened and the surgeon who had attended me came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my good animal said he as your late master has scarcely left enough to pay for the expenses of his funeral and nothing to remunerate me for my trouble i shall make bold to take possession of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if your paces are good i shall keep you for my own riding if not i shall take you to horncastle your original destination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then bridled and saddled me and leading me out mounted and then trotted me up and down before the house at the door of which the old man who now appeared to be dressed in regular jockey fashion was standing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like his paces well said the surgeon i think i shall take him for my own use <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what am i to have for all the trouble his master caused me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said my late entertainer on whose countenance i now observed for the first time a diabolical squint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the consciousness of having done your duty to a fellowcreature in succouring him in a time of distress must be your reward said the surgeon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pretty gammon truly said my late entertainer what would you say if i were to talk in that way to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come unless you choose to behave jonnock i shall take the bridle and lead the horse back into the stable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said the surgeon we are old friends and i dont wish to dispute with you so ill tell you what i will do i will ride the animal to horncastle and we will share what he fetches like brothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good said the old man but if you say that you have sold him for less than a hundred i shant consider you jonnock remember what the young fellow said that young fellow i heard no more for the next moment i found myself on a broad road leading as i supposed in the direction of horncastle the surgeon still in the saddle and my legs moving at a rapid trot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get on said the surgeon jerking my mouth with the bit whereupon full of rage i instantly set off at a full gallop determined if possible to dash my rider to the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon however kept his seat and so far from attempting to abate my speed urged me on to greater efforts with a stout stick which methought he held in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain did i rear and kick attempting to get rid of my foe but the surgeon remained as saddlefast as ever the maugrabin sorcerer in the arabian tale what time he rode the young prince transformed into a steed to his enchanted palace in the wilderness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last as i was still madly dashing on panting and blowing and had almost given up all hope i saw at a distance before me a heap of stones by the side of the road probably placed there for the purpose of repairing it a thought appeared to strike me i will shy at those stones and if i cant get rid of him so resign myself to my fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i increased my speed till arriving within about ten yards of the heap i made a desperate start turning half round with nearly the velocity of a millstone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh the joy i experienced when i felt my enemy canted over my neck and saw him lying senseless in the road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have you now in my power i said or rather neighed as going up to my prostrate foe i stood over him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suppose i were to rear now and let my fore feet fall upon you what would your life be worth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is supposing you are not killed already but lie there i will do you no further harm but trot to horncastle without a rider and when there and without further reflection off i trotted in the direction of horncastle but had not gone far before my bridle falling from my neck got entangled with my off fore foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt myself falling a thrill of agony shot through me my knees would be broken and what should i do at horncastle with a pair of broken knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i struggled but i could not disengage my off fore foot and downward i fell but before i had reached the ground i awoke and found myself half out of bed my bandaged arm in considerable pain and my left hand just touching the floor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with some difficulty i readjusted myself in bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was now early morning and the first rays of the sun were beginning to penetrate the white curtains of a window on my left which probably looked into the garden as i caught a glimpse or two of the leaves of trees through a small uncovered part at the side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some time i felt uneasy and anxious my spirits being in a strange fluttering state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last my eyes fell upon a small row of teacups seemingly of china which stood on a mantelpiece exactly fronting the bottom of the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight of these objects i know not why soothed and pacified me i kept my eyes fixed upon them as i lay on my back on the bed with my head upon the pillow till at last i fell into a calm and refreshing sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning after a fall the teapot unpretending hospitality the chinese student <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might be about eight oclock in the morning when i was awakened by the entrance of the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he coming up to the bedside and looking me in the face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i and i feel much better but i am still very sore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i surveyed him now for the first time with attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was dressed in a sobercoloured suit and was apparently between sixty and seventy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in stature he was rather above the middle height but with a slight stoop his features were placid and expressive of much benevolence but as it appeared to me with rather a melancholy cast as i gazed upon them i felt ashamed that i should ever have conceived in my brain a vision like that of the preceding night in which he appeared in so disadvantageous a light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length he said it is now time for you to take some refreshment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hear my old servant coming up with your breakfast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a moment the elderly female entered with a tray on which was some bread and butter a teapot and cup <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cup was of common blue earthenware but the pot was of china curiously fashioned and seemingly of great antiquity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man poured me out a cupful of tea and then with the assistance of the woman raised me higher and propped me up with the pillows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ate and drank when the pot was emptied of its liquid it did not contain much i raised it up with my left hand to inspect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sides were covered with curious characters seemingly hieroglyphics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after surveying them for some time i replaced it upon the tray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you seem fond of china said i to the old man after the servant had retired with the breakfast things and i had returned to my former posture you have china on the mantelpiece and that was a remarkable teapot out of which i have just been drinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man fixed his eyes intently on me and methought the expression of his countenance became yet more melancholy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said he at last i am fond of china i have reason to be fond of china but for china i should and here he sighed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you value it for the quaintness and singularity of its form said i it appears to be less adapted for real use than our own pottery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i care little about its form said the old man i care for it simply on account of however why talk to you on the subject which can have no possible interest to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i expect the surgeon here presently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not like that surgeon at all said i how strangely he behaved last night coming back when i was just falling asleep to ask me if i would sell my horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has but one failing said he an itch for horsedealing but for that he might be a much richer man than he is he is continually buying and exchanging horses and generally finds himself a loser by his bargains but he is a worthy creature and skilful in his profession it is well for you that you are under his care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man then left me and in about an hour returned with the surgeon who examined me and reported favourably as to my case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke to me with kindness and feeling and did not introduce the subject of the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked him whether he thought i should be in time for the fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw some people making their way thither today said he the fair lasts three weeks and it has just commenced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i think i may promise you that you will be in time for the very heat of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few days you will be able to mount your saddle with your arm in a sling but you must by no means appear with your arm in a sling at horncastle as people would think that your horse had flung you and that you wanted to dispose of him because he was a vicious brute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must by all means drop the sling before you get to horncastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for three days i kept my apartment by the advice of the surgeon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i passed my time as i best could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stretched on my bed i either abandoned myself to reflection or listened to the voices of the birds in the neighbouring garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes as i lay awake at night i would endeavour to catch the tick of a clock which methought sounded from some distant part of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man visited me twice or thrice every day to inquire into my state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his words were few on these occasions and he did not stay long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet his voice and his words were kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what surprised me most in connection with this individual was the delicacy of conduct which he exhibited in not letting a word proceed from his lips which could testify curiosity respecting who i was or whence i came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all he knew of me was that i had been flung from my horse on my way to a fair for the purpose of disposing of the animal and that i was now his guest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might be a common horsedealer for what he knew yet i was treated by him with all the attention which i could have expected had i been an alderman of bostons heir and known to him as such <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the county in which i am now thought i at last must be either extraordinarily devoted to hospitality or this old host of mine must be an extraordinary individual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the evening of the fourth day feeling tired of my confinement i put my clothes on in the best manner i could and left the chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> descending a flight of stairs i reached a kind of quadrangle from which branched two or three passages one of these i entered which had a door at the farther end and one on each side the one to the left standing partly open i entered it and found myself in a middlesized room with a large window or rather glassdoor which looked into a garden and which stood open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing remarkable in this room except a large quantity of china <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was china on the mantelpiece china on two tables and a small beaufet which stood opposite the glassdoor was covered with china there were cups teapots and vases of various forms and on all of them i observed characters not a teapot not a teacup not a vase of whatever form or size but appeared to possess hieroglyphics on some part or other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after surveying these articles for some time with no little interest i passed into the garden in which there were small parterres of flowers and two or three trees and which where the house did not abut was bounded by a wall turning to the right by a walk by the side of a house i passed by a door probably the one i had seen at the end of the passage and arrived at another window similar to that through which i had come and which also stood open i was about to pass through it when i heard the voice of my entertainer exclaiming is that you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i entered the room which seemed to be a counterpart of the one which i had just left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was of the same size had the same kind of furniture and appeared to be equally well stocked with china one prominent article it possessed however which the other room did not exhibit namely a clock which with its pendulum moving tickatick hung against the wall opposite to the door the sight of which made me conclude that the sound which methought i had heard in the stillness of the night was not an imaginary one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there it hung on the wall with its pendulum moving ticka tick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old gentleman was seated in an easy chair a little way into the room having the glassdoor on his right hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a table before him lay a large open volume in which i observed roman letters as well as characters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few inches beyond the book on the table covered all over with hieroglyphics stood a china vase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eyes of the old man were fixed upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit down said he motioning me with his hand to a stool close by but without taking his eyes from the vase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant make it out said he at last removing his eyes from the vase and leaning back on the chair i cant make it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could assist you said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> assist me said the old man looking at me with a half smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said i but i dont understand chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose not said the old man with another slight smile but but pray proceed said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wished to ask you said the old man how you knew that the characters on yon piece of crockery were chinese or indeed that there was such a language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew the crockery was china said i and naturally enough supposed what was written upon it to be chinese as for there being such a language the english have a language the french have a language and why not the chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i ask you a question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know any language besides english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said i i know a little of two or three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i i know a little french <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes a little welsh and a little haik <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am glad to see you in my house said the old man shaking me by the hand how singular that one coming as you did should know armenian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not more singular said i than that one living in such a place as this should know chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how came you to acquire it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man looked at me and sighed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg pardon said i for asking what is perhaps an impertinent question i have not imitated your own delicacy you have never asked me a question without first desiring permission and here i have been days and nights in your house an intruder on your hospitality and you have never so much as asked me who i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in forbearing to do that said the old man i merely obeyed the chinese precept ask no questions of a guest it is written on both sides of the teapot out of which you have had your tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i knew chinese said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it a difficult language to acquire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have reason to think so said the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been occupied upon it fiveandthirty years and i am still very imperfectly acquainted with it at least i frequently find upon my crockery sentences the meaning of which to me is very dark though it is true these sentences are mostly verses which are of course more difficult to understand than mere prose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are your chinese studies said i confined to crockery literature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> entirely said the old man i read nothing else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard said i that the chinese have no letters but that for every word they have a separate character is it so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for every word they have a particular character said the old man though to prevent confusion they have arranged their words under two hundred and fourteen what we should call radicals but which they call keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we arrange all our words in a dictionary under twentyfour letters so do they arrange all their words or characters under two hundred and fourteen radical signs the simplest radicals being the first and the more complex the last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does the chinese resemble any of the european languages in words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am scarcely competent to inform you said the old man but i believe not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i pointing to one on the vase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a knife said the old man that character is one of the simplest radicals or keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what is the sound of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a strange word for a knife is it not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were never at school at edinburgh i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that accounts for your not knowing the meaning of tawse said i had you received the rudiments of a classical education at the high school you would have known the meaning of tawse full well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a leathern thong with which refractory urchins are recalled to a sense of their duty by the dominie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot see what the two words have in common except a slight agreement in sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will see the connection said i when i inform you that the thong from the middle to the bottom is cut or slit into two or three parts from which slits or cuts unless i am very much mistaken it derives its name tawse a thong with slits or cuts used for chastising disorderly urchins at the high school from the french tailler to cut evidently connected with the chinese tau a knife how very extraordinary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> convalescence the surgeons bill letter of recommendation commencement of the old mans history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two days three days passed away and i still remained at the house of my hospitable entertainer my bruised limb rapidly recovering the power of performing its functions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i passed my time agreeably enough sometimes in my chamber communing with my own thoughts sometimes in the stable attending to and not unfrequently conversing with my horse and at mealtime for i seldom saw him at any other discoursing with the old gentleman sometimes on the chinese vocabulary sometimes on chinese syntax and once or twice on english horseflesh though on this latter subject notwithstanding his descent from a race of horsetraders he did not enter into with much alacrity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a small requital for his kindness i gave him one day after dinner unasked a brief account of my history and pursuits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened with attention and when it was concluded thanked me for the confidence which i had reposed in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such conduct said he deserves a return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell you my own history it is brief but may perhaps not prove uninteresting to you though the relation of it will give me some pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray then do not recite it said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the old man i will tell you for i wish you to know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was about to begin when he was interrupted by the arrival of the surgeon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon examined into the state of my bruised limb and told me what indeed i already well knew that it was rapidly improving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will not even require a sling said he to ride to horncastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when do you think i may venture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think if you are a tolerably good horseman you may mount the day after tomorrow answered the medical man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bythebye are you acquainted with anybody at horncastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with no living soul i answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you would scarcely find stableroom for your horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am happy to be able to assist you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a friend there who keeps a small inn and who during the time of the fair keeps a stall vacant for any quadruped i may bring until he knows whether i am coming or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will give you a letter to him and he will see after the accommodation of your horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow i will pay you a farewell visit and bring you the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you said i and do not forget to bring your bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon looked at the old man who gave him a peculiar nod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he in reply to me for the little service i have rendered you i require no remuneration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are in my friends house and he and i understand each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never receive such favours said i as you have rendered me without remunerating them therefore i shall expect your bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as you please said the surgeon and shaking me by the hand more warmly than he had hitherto done he took his leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the evening of the next day the last which i spent with my kind entertainer i sat at tea with him in a little summerhouse in his garden partially shaded by the boughs of a large figtree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon had shortly before paid me his farewell visit and had brought me the letter of introduction to his friend at horncastle and also his bill which i found anything but extravagant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after we had each respectively drank the contents of two cups and it may not be amiss here to inform the reader that though i took cream with my tea as i always do when i can procure that addition the old man like most people bred up in the country drank his without it he thus addressed me i am as i told you on the night of your accident the son of a breeder of horses a respectable and honest man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i was about twenty he died leaving me his only child a comfortable property consisting of about two hundred acres of land and some fifteen hundred pounds in money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother had died about three years previously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt the death of my mother keenly but that of my father less than was my duty indeed truth compels me to acknowledge that i scarcely regretted his death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cause of this want of proper filial feeling was the opposition which i had experienced from him in an affair which deeply concerned me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had formed an attachment for a young female in the neighbourhood who though poor was of highly respectable birth her father having been a curate of the established church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was at the time of which i am speaking an orphan having lost both her parents and supported herself by keeping a small school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my attachment was returned and we had pledged our vows but my father who could not reconcile himself to her lack of fortune forbade our marriage in the most positive terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was wrong for she was a fortune in herself amiable and accomplished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot tell you all she was and here the old man drew his hand across his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the death of my father the only obstacle to our happiness appeared to be removed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we agreed therefore that our marriage should take place within the course of a year and i forthwith commenced enlarging my house and getting my affairs in order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having been left in the easy circumstances which i have described i determined to follow no business but to pass my life in a strictly domestic manner and to be very very happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amongst other property derived from my father were several horses which i disposed of in this neighbourhood with the exception of two remarkably fine ones which i determined to take to the next fair at horncastle the only place where i expected to be able to obtain what i considered to be their full value <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length the time arrived for the commencement of the fair which was within three months of the period which my beloved and myself had fixed upon for the celebration of our nuptials <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to the fair i went a couple of trusty men following me with the horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i soon found a purchaser for the animals a portly plausible person of about forty dressed in a blue riding coat brown top boots and leather breeches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a strangelooking urchin with him attired in nearly similar fashion with a beam in one of his eyes who called him father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man paid me for the purchase in banknotes three fiftypound notes for the two horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we were about to take leave of each other he suddenly produced another fiftypound note inquiring whether i could change it complaining at the same time of the difficulty of procuring change in the fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i happened to have plenty of small money in my possession and as i felt obliged to him for having purchased my horses at what i considered to be a good price i informed him that i should be very happy to accommodate him so i changed him the note and he having taken possession of the horses went his way and i myself returned home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a month passed during this time i paid away two of the notes which i had received at horncastle from the dealer one of them in my immediate neighbourhood and the other at a town about fifteen miles distant to which i had repaired for the purpose of purchasing some furniture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all things seemed to be going on most prosperously and i felt quite happy when one morning as i was overlooking some workmen who were employed about my house i was accosted by a constable who informed me that he was sent to request my immediate appearance before a neighbouring bench of magistrates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> concluding that i was merely summoned on some unimportant business connected with the neighbourhood i felt no surprise and forthwith departed in company with the officer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the demeanour of the man upon the way struck me as somewhat singular <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had frequently spoken to him before and had always found him civil and respectful but he was now reserved and sullen and replied to two or three questions which i put to him in anything but a courteous manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on arriving at the place where the magistrates were sitting an inn at a small town about two miles distant i found a more than usual number of people assembled who appeared to be conversing with considerable eagerness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sight of me they became silent but crowded after me as i followed the man into the magistrates room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there i found the tradesman to whom i had paid the note for the furniture at the town fifteen miles off in attendance accompanied by an agent of the bank of england the former it seems had paid the note into a provincial bank the proprietors of which discovering it to be a forgery had forthwith written up to the bank of england who had sent down their agent to investigate the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a third individual stood beside them the person in my own immediate neighbourhood to whom i had paid the second note this by some means or other before the coming down of the agent had found its way to the same provincial bank and also being pronounced a forgery it had speedily been traced to the person to whom i had paid it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was owing to the apparition of this second note that the agent had determined without further inquiry to cause me to be summoned before the rural tribunal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few words the magistrates clerk gave me to understand the state of the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was filled with surprise and consternation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew myself to be perfectly innocent of any fraudulent intention but at the time of which i am speaking it was a matter fraught with the greatest danger to be mixed up however innocently with the passing of false money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the law with respect to forgery was terribly severe and the innocent as well as the guilty occasionally suffered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of this i was not altogether ignorant unfortunately however in my transactions with the stranger the idea of false notes being offered to me and my being brought into trouble by means of them never entered my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> recovering myself a little i stated that the notes in question were two of three notes which i had received at horncastle for a pair of horses which it was well known i had carried thither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon i produced from my pocketbook the third note which was forthwith pronounced a forgery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had scarcely produced the third note when i remembered the one which i had changed for the horncastle dealer and with the remembrance came the almost certain conviction that it was also a forgery i was tempted for a moment to produce it and to explain the circumstance would to god i had done so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but shame at the idea of having been so wretchedly duped prevented me and the opportunity was lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must confess that the agent of the bank behaved upon the whole in a very handsome manner he said that as it was quite evident that i had disposed of certain horses at the fair it was very probable that i might have received the notes in question in exchange for them and that he was willing as he had received a very excellent account of my general conduct to press the matter no farther that is provided and here he stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon one of the three magistrates who were present asked me whether i chanced to have any more of these spurious notes in my possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he certainly had a right to ask the question but there was something peculiar in his toneinsinuating suspicion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is certainly difficult to judge of the motives which rule a persons conduct but i cannot help imagining that he was somewhat influenced in his behaviour on that occasion which was anything but friendly by my having refused to sell him the horses at a price less than that which i expected to get at the fair be this as it may the question filled me with embarrassment and i bitterly repented not having at first been more explicit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon the magistrate in the same kind of tone demanded to see my pocketbook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew that to demur would be useless and produced it and therewith amongst two or three small country notes appeared the fourth which i had received from the horncastle dealer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the agent took it up and examined it with attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well is it a genuine note <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sorry to say that it is not said the agent it is a forgery like the other three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the magistrate shrugged his shoulders as indeed did several people in the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a regular dealer in forged notes said seeing matters begin to look so serious i aroused myself and endeavoured to speak in my own behalf giving a candid account of the manner in which i became possessed of the notes but my explanation did not appear to meet much credit the magistrate to whom i have in particular alluded asked why i had not at once stated the fact of my having received a fourth note and the agent though in a very quiet tone observed that he could not help thinking it somewhat strange that i should have changed a note of so much value for a perfect stranger even supposing that he had purchased my horses and had paid me their value in hard cash and i noticed that he laid particular emphasis on the last words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might have observed that i was an inexperienced young man who meaning no harm myself suspected none in others but i was confused stunned and my tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of my mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men who had taken my horses to horncastle and for whom i had sent as they lived close at hand now arrived but the evidence which they could give was anything but conclusive in my favour they had seen me in company with an individual at horncastle to whom by my orders they had delivered certain horses but they had seen no part of the money transaction the fellow whether from design or not having taken me aside into a retired place where he had paid me the three spurious notes and induced me to change the fourth which throughout the affair was what bore most materially against me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how matters might have terminated i do not know i might have gone to prison and i might have been just then when i most needed a friend and least expected to find one for though amongst those present there were several who were my neighbours and who had professed friendship for me none of them when they saw that i needed support and encouragement came forward to yield me any but on the contrary appeared by their looks to enjoy my terror and confusion just then a friend entered the room in the person of the surgeon of the neighbourhood the father of him who has attended you he was not on very intimate terms with me but he had occasionally spoken to me and had attended my father in his dying illness and chancing to hear that i was in trouble he now hastened to assist me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a short preamble in which he apologized to the bench for interfering he begged to be informed of the state of the case whereupon the matter was laid before him in all its details <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not slow in taking a fair view of it and spoke well and eloquently in my behalf insisting on the improbability that a person of my habits and position would be wilfully mixed up with a transaction like that of which it appeared i was suspected adding that as he was fully convinced of my innocence he was ready to enter into any surety with respect to my appearance at any time to answer anything which might be laid to my charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this last observation had particular effect and as he was a person universally respected both for his skill in his profession and his general demeanour people began to think that a person in whom he took an interest could scarcely be concerned in anything criminal and though my friend the magistrate i call him so ironically made two or three demurs it was at last agreed between him and his brethren of the bench that for the present i should be merely called upon to enter into my own recognizance for the sum of two hundred pounds to appear whenever it should be deemed requisite to enter into any further investigation of the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i was permitted to depart from the tribunal of petty justice without handcuffs and uncollared by a constable but people looked coldly and suspiciously upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing i did was to hasten to the house of my beloved in order to inform her of every circumstance attending the transaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a malicious female individual had hurried to her with a distorted tale to the effect that i had been taken up as an utterer of forged notes that an immense number had been found in my possession that i was already committed and that probably i should be executed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my affianced one tenderly loved me and her constitution was delicate fit succeeded fit she broke a bloodvessel and i found her deluged in blood the surgeon had been sent for he came and afforded her every possible relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was distracted he bade me have hope but i observed he looked very grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the skill of the surgeon the poor girl was saved in the first instance from the arms of death and for a few weeks she appeared to be rapidly recovering by degrees however she became melancholy a worm preyed upon her spirit a slow fever took possession of her frame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i subsequently learned that the same malicious female who had first carried to her an exaggerated account of the affair and who was a distant relative of her own frequently visited her and did all in her power to excite her fears with respect to its eventual termination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> time passed on in a very wretched manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our friend the surgeon showing to us both every mark of kindness and attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was owing to this excellent man that my innocence was eventually established <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having been called to a town on the borders of yorkshire to a medical consultation he chanced to be taking a glass of wine with the landlord of the inn at which he stopped when the waiter brought in a note to be changed saying that the quaker gentleman who had been for some days in the house and was about to depart had sent it to be changed in order that he might pay his bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlord took the note and looked at it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fiftypound bill said he i dont like changing bills of that amount lest they should prove bad ones however as it comes from a quaker gentleman i suppose it is all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mention of a fiftypound note aroused the attention of my friend and he requested to be permitted to look at it he had scarcely seen it when he was convinced that it was one of the same description as those which had brought me into trouble as it corresponded with them in two particular features which the agent of the bank had pointed out to him and others as evidence of their spuriousness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friend without a moments hesitation informed the landlord that the note was a bad one expressing at the same time a great wish to see the quaker gentleman who wanted to have it changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that you can easily do said the landlord and forthwith conducted him into the common room where he saw a respectablelooking man dressed like a quaker and seemingly about sixty years of age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friend after a short apology showed him the note which he held in his hand stating that he had no doubt it was a spurious one and begged to be informed where he had taken it adding that a particular friend of his was at present in trouble owing to his having taken similar notes from a stranger at horncastle but that he hoped that he the quaker could give information by means of which the guilty party or parties could be arrested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the mention of horncastle it appeared to my friend that the quaker gave a slight start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the conclusion of this speech however he answered with great tranquillity that he had received it in the way of business at naming one of the principal towns in yorkshire from a very respectable person whose name he was perfectly willing to communicate and likewise his own which he said was james and that he was a merchant residing at liverpool that he would write to his friend at requesting him to make inquiries on the subject that just at that moment he was in a hurry to depart having some particular business at a town about ten miles off to go to which he had bespoken a postchaise of the landlord that with respect to the note it was doubtless a very disagreeable thing to have a suspicious one in his possession but that it would make little difference to him as he had plenty of other money and thereupon he pulled out a purse containing various other notes and some gold observing that his only motive for wishing to change the other note was a desire to be well provided with change and finally that if they had any suspicion with respect to him he was perfectly willing to leave the note in their possession till he should return which he intended to do in about a fortnight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was so much plausibility in the speech of the quaker and his appearance and behaviour were so perfectly respectable that my friend felt almost ashamed of the suspicion which at first he had entertained of him though at the same time he felt an unaccountable unwillingness to let the man depart without some further interrogation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlord however who did not wish to disoblige one who had been and might probably be again a profitable customer declared that he was perfectly satisfied and that he had no wish to detain the note which he made no doubt the gentleman had received in the way of business and that as the matter concerned him alone he would leave it to him to make the necessary inquiries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as you please friend said the quaker pocketing the suspicious note i will now pay my bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon he discharged the bill with a fivepound note which he begged the landlord to inspect carefully and with two pieces of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlord had just taken the money receipted the bill and was bowing to his customer when the door opened and a lad dressed in a kind of grey livery appeared and informed the quaker that the chaise was ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is friend said the quaker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hast thou any reason for asking me that question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and has he been long in your service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> several years replied the quaker i took him into my house out of compassion he being an orphan but as the chaise is waiting i will bid thee farewell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid i must stop your journey for the present said the surgeon that boy has exactly the same blemish in the eye which a boy had who was in company with the man at horncastle from whom my friend received the forged notes and who there passed for his son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know nothing about that said the quaker but i am determined to be detained here no longer after the satisfactory account which i have given as to the notes coming into my possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then attempted to leave the room but my friend detained him a struggle ensued during which a wig which the quaker wore fell off whereupon he instantly appeared to lose some twenty years of his age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> knock the fellow down father said the boy ill help and forsooth the pretended quaker took the boys advice and knocked my friend down in a twinkling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlord however and waiter seeing how matters stood instantly laid hold of him but there can be no doubt that he would have escaped from the whole three had not certain guests who were in the house hearing the noise rushed in and helped to secure him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boy was true to his word assisting him to the best of his ability flinging himself between the legs of his fathers assailants causing several of them to stumble and fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length the fellow was secured and led before a magistrate the boy to whom he was heard to say something which nobody understood and to whom after the mans capture no one paid much attention was no more seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest as far as this man was concerned may be told in a few words nothing to criminate him was found on his person but on his baggage being examined a quantity of spurious notes were discovered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> much of his hardihood now forsook him and in the hope of saving his life he made some very important disclosures amongst other things he confessed that it was he who had given me the notes in exchange for the horses and also the note to be changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was subsequently tried on two indictments in the second of which i appeared against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was condemned to die but in consideration of the disclosures he had made his sentence was commuted to perpetual transportation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my innocence was thus perfectly established before the eyes of the world and all my friends hastened to congratulate me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was one who congratulated me more than all the rest it was my beloved one but but she was dying here the old man drew his hand before his eyes and remained for some time without speaking at length he removed his hand and commenced again with a broken voice you will pardon me if i hurry over this part of my story i am unable to dwell upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how dwell upon a period when i saw my only earthly treasure pine away gradually day by day and knew that nothing could save her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw my agony and did all she could to console me saying that she was herself quite resigned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little time before her death she expressed a wish that we should be united <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was too happy to comply with her request <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were united i brought her to this house where in less than a week she expired in my arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old mans story continued misery in the head the strange marks teadealer from london difficulties of the chinese language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after another pause the old man once more resumed his narration if ever there was a man perfectly miserable it was myself after the loss of that cherished woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sat solitary in the house in which i had hoped in her company to realize the choicest earthly happiness a prey to the bitterest reflections many people visited and endeavoured to console me amongst them was the clergyman of the parish who begged me to be resigned and told me that it was good to be afflicted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bowed my head but i could not help thinking how easy it must be for those who feel no affliction to bid others to be resigned and to talk of the benefit resulting from sorrow perhaps i should have paid more attention to his discourse than i did provided he had been a person for whom it was possible to entertain much respect but his own heart was known to be set on the things of this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> within a little time he had an opportunity in his own case of practising resignation and of realizing the benefit of being afflicted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a merchant to whom he had entrusted all his fortune in the hope of a large interest became suddenly a bankrupt with scarcely any assets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not say that it was owing to this misfortune that the divine died in less than a month after its occurrence but such was the fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amongst those who most frequently visited me was my friend the surgeon he did not confine himself to the common topics of consolation but endeavoured to impress upon me the necessity of rousing myself advising me to occupy my mind with some pursuit particularly recommending agriculture but agriculture possessed no interest for me nor indeed any pursuit within my reach my hopes of happiness had been blighted and what cared i for anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so at last he thought it best to leave me to myself hoping that time would bring with it consolation and i remained solitary in my house waited upon by a male and a female servant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh what dreary moments i passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my only amusement and it was a sad one was to look at the things which once belonged to my beloved and which were new in my possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how fondly would i dwell upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were some books i cared not for books but these had belonged to my beloved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh how fondly did i dwell on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was her hat and bonnet oh me how fondly did i gaze upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after looking at her things for hours i would sit and ruminate on the happiness i had lost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how i execrated the moment i had gone to the fair to sell horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would that i had never been to horncastle to sell horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would say i might at this moment have been enjoying the company of my beloved leading a happy quiet easy life but for that fatal expedition that thought worked on my brain till my brain seemed to turn round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day i sat at the breakfasttable gazing vacantly around me my mind was in a state of inexpressible misery there was a whirl in my brain probably like that which people feel who are rapidly going mad this increased to such a degree that i felt giddiness coming upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to abate this feeling i no longer permitted my eyes to wander about but fixed them upon an object on the table and continued gazing at it for several minutes without knowing what it was at length the misery in my head was somewhat stilled my lips moved and i heard myself saying what odd marks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had fastened my eyes on the side of a teapot and by keeping them fixed upon it had become aware of a fact that had escaped my notice before namely that there were marks upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i kept my eyes fixed upon them and repeated at intervals what strange marks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i thought that looking upon the marks tended to abate the whirl in my head i kept tracing the marks one after the other and i observed that though they all bore a general resemblance to each other they were all to a certain extent different <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the smallest portion possible of curious interest had been awakened within me and at last i asked myself within my own mind what motive could induce people to put such odd marks on their crockery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not pictures they were not letters what motive could people have for putting them there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last i removed my eyes from the teapot and thought for a few moments about the marks presently however i felt the whirl returning the marks became almost effaced from my mind and i was beginning to revert to my miserable ruminations when suddenly methought i heard a voice say the marks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or so i fixed my eyes again upon the marks inspecting them more attentively if possible than i had done before and at last i came to the conclusion that they were not capricious or fanciful marks but were arranged systematically when i had gazed at them for a considerable time i turned the teapot round and on the other side i observed marks of a similar kind which i soon discovered were identical with the ones i had been observing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the marks were something alike but all somewhat different and on comparing them with each other i was struck with the frequent occurrence of a mark crossing an upright line or projecting from it now on the right now on the left side and i said to myself why does this mark sometimes cross the upright line and sometimes project <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the more i thought on the matter the less did i feel of the misery in my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the things were at length removed and i sat as i had for some time past been wont to sit after my meals silent and motionless but in the present instance my mind was not entirely abandoned to the one mournful idea which had so long distressed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was to a certain extent occupied with the marks on the teapot it is true that the mournful idea strove hard with the marks on the teapot for the mastery in my mind and at last the painful idea drove the marks of the teapot out they however would occasionally return and flit across my mind for a moment or two and their coming was like a momentary relief from intense pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought once or twice that i would have the teapot placed before me that i might examine the marks at leisure but i considered that it would be as well to defer the reexamination of the marks till the next morning at that time i did not take tea of an evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by deferring the examination thus i had something to look forward to on the next morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day was a melancholy one but it certainly was more tolerable to me than any of the others had been since the death of my beloved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i lay awake that night i occasionally thought of the marks and in my sleep methought i saw them upon the teapot vividly before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the morrow i examined the marks again how singular they looked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely they must mean something and if so what could they mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at last i thought within myself whether it would be possible for me to make out what they meant that day i felt more relief than on the preceding one and towards night i walked a little about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in about a weeks time i received a visit from my friend the surgeon after a little discourse he told me that he perceived i was better than when he had last seen me and asked me what i had been about i told him that i had been principally occupied in considering certain marks which i had found on a teapot and wondering what they could mean he smiled at first but instantly assuming a serious look he asked to see the teapot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i produced it and after having surveyed the marks with attention he observed that they were highly curious and also wondered what they meant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i strongly advise you said he to attempt to make them out and also to take moderate exercise and to see after your concerns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed his advice every morning i studied the marks on the teapot and in the course of the day took moderate exercise and attended to little domestic matters as became the master of a house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i subsequently learned that the surgeon in advising me to study the marks and endeavour to make out their meaning merely hoped that by means of them my mind might by degrees be diverted from the mournful idea on which i had so long brooded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a man well skilled in his profession but had read and thought very little on matters unconnected with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had no idea that the marks had any particular signification or were anything else but common and fortuitous ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i became at all acquainted with their nature was owing to a ludicrous circumstance which i will now relate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day chancing to be at a neighbouring town i was struck with the appearance of a shop recently established <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had an immense bowwindow and every part of it to which a brush could be applied was painted in a gaudy flaming style <end> <end> 
<start> <start> large bowls of green and black tea were placed upon certain chests which stood at the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stopped to look at them such a display whatever it may be at the present time being at the period of which i am speaking quite uncommon in a country town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tea whether black or green was very shining and inviting and the bowls of which there were three standing on as many chests were very grand and foreign looking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two of these were white with figures and trees painted upon them in blue the other which was the middlemost had neither trees nor figures upon it but as i looked through the window appeared to have on its sides the very same kind of marks which i had observed on the teapot at home there were also marks on the teachests somewhat similar but much larger and apparently not executed with so much care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> best teas direct from china said a voice close to my side and looking round i saw a youngish man with a frizzled head flat face and an immensely wide mouth standing in his shirtsleeves by the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> direct from china said he perhaps you will do me the favour to walk in and scent them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not want any tea said i i was only standing at the window examining those marks on the bowl and the chests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have observed similar ones on a teapot at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray walk in sir said the young fellow extending his mouth till it reached nearly from ear to ear pray walk in and i shall be happy to give you any information respecting the manners and customs of the chinese in my power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon i followed him into his shop where he began to harangue on the manners customs and peculiarities of the chinese especially their manner of preparing tea not forgetting to tell me that the only genuine chinese tea ever imported into england was to be found in his shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with respect to those marks said he on the bowl and chests they are nothing more nor less than chinese writing expressing something though what i cant exactly tell you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> allow me to sell you this pound of tea he added showing me a paper parcel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the envelope there is a printed account of the chinese system of writing extracted from authors of the most established reputation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these things i print principally with the hope of in some degree removing the worse than gothic ignorance prevalent amongst natives of these parts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with respect to all that relates to the chinese real imperial tea i assure you sir that well to make short of what you doubtless consider a very tiresome story i purchased the tea and carried it home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tea proved imperially bad but the paper envelope really contained some information on the chinese language and writing amounting to about as much as you gained from me the other day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on learning that the marks on the teapot expressed words i felt my interest with respect to them considerably increased and returned to the task of inspecting them with greater zeal than before hoping by continually looking at them to be able eventually to understand their meaning in which hope you may easily believe i was disappointed though my desire to understand what they represented continued on the increase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this dilemma i determined to apply again to the shopkeeper from whom i bought the tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found him in rather low spirits his shirtsleeves were soiled and his hair was out of curl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on my inquiring how he got on he informed me that he intended speedily to leave having received little or no encouragement the people in their gothic ignorance preferring to deal with an oldfashioned shopkeeper over the way who so far from possessing any acquaintance with the polity and institutions of the chinese did not he believed know that tea came from china <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are come for some more i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on receiving an answer in the negative he looked somewhat blank but when i added that i came to consult with him as to the means which i must take in order to acquire the chinese language he brightened up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must get a grammar said he rubbing his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he replied but any bookseller can procure you one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i was taking my departure he told me that as he was about to leave the neighbourhood the bowl at the window which bore the inscription besides some other pieces of porcelain of a similar description were at my service provided i chose to purchase them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i consented and two or three days afterwards took from off his hands all the china in his possession which bore the inscriptions paying what he demanded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had i waited till the sale of his effects which occurred within a few weeks i could probably have procured it for a fifth part of the sum which i paid the other pieces realizing very little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not however grudge the poor fellow what he got from me as i considered myself to be somewhat in his debt for the information he had afforded me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the rest of my story it may be briefly told <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed the advice of the shopkeeper and applied to a bookseller who wrote to his correspondent in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a long interval i was informed that if i wished to learn chinese i must do so through the medium of french there being neither chinese grammar nor dictionary in our language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was at first very much disheartened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i determined however at last to gratify my desire of learning chinese even at the expense of learning french <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i procured the books and in order to qualify myself to turn them to account took lessons in french from a little swiss the usher of a neighbouring boardingschool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was very stupid in acquiring french perseverance however enabled me to acquire a knowledge sufficient for the object i had in view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in about two years i began to study chinese by myself through the medium of the french <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i and how did you get on with the study of the chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the old man proceeded to inform me how he got on with the study of chinese enumerated all the difficulties he had had to encounter dilating upon his frequent despondency of mind and occasionally his utter despair of ever mastering chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he told me that more than once he had determined upon giving up the study but when the misery in his head forthwith returned to escape from which he had as often resumed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it appeared however that ten years elapsed before he was able to use ten of the two hundred and fourteen keys which serve to undo the locks of chinese writing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and are you able at present to use the entire number <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the old man i can at present use the whole number <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know the key for every particular lock though i frequently find the wards unwilling to give way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> has nothing particular occurred to you said i during the time that you have been prosecuting your studies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the whole time in which i have been engaged in these studies said the old man only one circumstance has occurred which requires any particular mention the death of my old friend the surgeon who was carried off suddenly by a fit of apoplexy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his death was a great shock to me and for a time interrupted my studies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his son however who succeeded him was very kind to me and in some degree supplied his fathers place and i gradually returned to my chinese locks and keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in applying keys to the chinese locks you employ your time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the old man in making out the inscriptions on the various pieces of porcelain which i have at different times procured i pass my time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first inscription which i translated was that on the teapot of my beloved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how many other pieces of porcelain may you have at present in your possession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how did you obtain them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without much labour said the old man in the neighbouring towns and villages chiefly at auctions of which about twenty years ago there were many in these parts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and may i ask your reasons for confining your studies entirely to the crockery literature of china when you have all the rest at your disposal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the inscriptions enable me to pass my time said the old man what more would the whole literature of china do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from these inscriptions said i what a book it is in your power to make whenever so disposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> translations from the crockery literature of china <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a book would be sure to take even glorious john himself would not disdain to publish it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no desire for literary distinction said he no ambition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my original wish was to pass my life in easy quiet obscurity with her whom i loved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was disappointed in my wish she was removed who constituted my only felicity in this life desolation came to my heart and misery to my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to escape from the latter i had recourse to chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees the misery left my head but the desolation of the heart yet remains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be of good cheer said i through the instrumentality of this affliction you have learnt chinese and in so doing learnt to practise the duties of hospitality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who but a man who could read runes on a teapot would have received an unfortunate wayfarer as you have received me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said the old man let us hope that all is for the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am by nature indolent and but for this affliction should perhaps have hardly taken the trouble to do my duty to my fellowcreatures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very very indolent said he slightly glancing towards the clock therefore let us hope that all is for the best but oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these trials they are very hard to bear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the leavetaking spirit of the hearth whats oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning having breakfasted with my old friend i went into the stable to make the necessary preparations for my departure there with the assistance of a stable lad i cleaned and caparisoned my horse and then returning into the house i made the old female attendant such a present as i deemed would be some compensation for the trouble i had caused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hearing that the old gentleman was in his study i repaired to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am come to take leave of you said i and to thank you for all the hospitality which i have received at your hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eyes of the old man were fixed steadfastly on the inscription which i had found him studying on a former occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length he murmured to himself i have it i think i have it and then looking at me he said so you are about to depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said i my horse will be at the front door in a few minutes i am glad however before i go to find that you have mastered the inscription <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the old man i believe i have mastered it it seems to consist of some verses relating to the worship of the spirit of the hearth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is the spirit of the hearth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the many demons which the chinese worship said the old man they do not worship one god but many <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the old man told me a great many highlyinteresting particulars respecting the demon worship of the chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the lapse of at least half an hour i said i must not linger here any longer however willing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> horncastle is distant and i wish to be there tonight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray can you inform me whats oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man rising looked towards the clock which hung on the side of the room at his left hand on the farther side of the table at which he was seated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am rather shortsighted said i and cannot distinguish the number at that distance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is ten oclock said the old man i believe somewhat past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the old man a quarter or seven minutes or ten minutes past ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why to tell you the truth said the old man with a smile there is one thing to the knowledge of which i could never exactly attain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to say said i that you do not know whats oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can give a guess said the old man to within a few minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you cannot tell the exact moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the name of wonder said i with that thing there on the wall continually ticking in your ear how comes it that you do not know whats oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why said the old man i have contented myself with giving a tolerably good guess to do more would have been too great trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you have learnt chinese said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the old man i have learnt chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i i really would counsel you to learn to know whats oclock as soon as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> consider what a sad thing it would be to go out of the world not knowing whats oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a millionth part of the trouble required to learn chinese would if employed infallibly teach you to know whats oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had a motive for learning chinese said the old man the hope of appeasing the misery in my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with respect to not knowing whats oclock i cannot see anything particularly sad in the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man may get through the world very creditably without knowing whats oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet upon the whole it is no bad thing to know whats oclock you of course do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be too good a joke if two people were to be together one knowing armenian and the other chinese and neither knowing whats oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arrival at horncastle the inn and ostlers the garret figure of a man with a candle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> leaving the house of the old man who knew chinese but could not tell what was oclock i wended my way to horncastle which i reached in the evening of the same day without having met any adventure on the way worthy of being marked down in this very remarkable history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town was a small one seemingly ancient and was crowded with people and horses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i proceeded without delay to the inn to which my friend the surgeon had directed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is of no use coming here said two or three ostlers as i entered the yard all full no room whatever whilst one added in an undertone that ere ant a badlooking horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to see the master of this inn said i as i dismounted from the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see the master said an ostler the same who had paid the negative kind of compliment to the horse a likely thing truly my master is drinking wine with some of the grand gentry and cant be disturbed for the sake of the like of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bring a letter to him said i pulling out the surgeons epistle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you would deliver it to him i added offering a halfcrown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the ostler taking the letter and the halfcrown my master will be right glad to see you why you hant been here for many a year ill carry the note to him at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with these words he hurried into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a nice horse young man said another ostler what will you take for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to which interrogation i made no answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wish to sell him said the ostler coming up to me and winking knowingly i think i and my partners might offer you a summut under seventy pounds to which kind and halfinsinuated offer i made no reply save by winking in the same kind of knowing manner in which i observed him wink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well young man perhaps you will drink tonight with me and my partners when we can talk the matter over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before i had time to answer the landlord a welldressed goodlooking man made his appearance with the ostler he bore the letter in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> without glancing at me he betook himself at once to consider the horse going round him and observing every point with the utmost minuteness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last having gone round the horse three times he stopped beside me and keeping his eyes on the horse bent his head towards his right shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that horse is worth some money said he turning towards me suddenly and slightly touching me on the arm with the letter which he held in his hand to which observation i made no reply save by bending my head towards the right shoulder as i had seen him do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man is going to talk to me and my partners about it tonight said the ostler who had expressed an opinion that he and his friends might offer me somewhat under seventy pounds for the animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the landlord the young man knows what he is about in the meantime lead the horse to the reserved stall and see well after him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my friend said he taking me aside after the ostler had led the animal away recommends you to me in the strongest manner on which account alone i take you and your horse in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i need not advise you not to be taken in as i should say by your look that you are tolerably awake but there are queer hands at horncastle at this time and those fellows of mine you understand me but i have a great deal to do at present so you must excuse me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and thereupon went into the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that same evening i was engaged at least two hours in the stable in rubbing the horse down and preparing him for the exhibition which i intended he should make in the fair on the following day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ostler to whom i had given the half crown occasionally assisted me though he was too much occupied by the horses of other guests to devote any length of time to the service of mine he more than once repeated to me his firm conviction that himself and partners could afford to offer me summut for the horse and at a later hour when in compliance with his invitation i took a glass of summut with himself and partners in a little room surrounded with cornchests on which we sat both himself and partners endeavoured to impress upon me chiefly by means of nods and winks their conviction that they could afford to give me summut for the horse provided i were disposed to sell him in return for which intimation with as many nods and winks as they had all collectively used i endeavoured to impress upon them my conviction that i could get summut handsomer in the fair than they might be disposed to offer me seeing as how which how i followed by a wink and a nod which they seemed perfectly to understand one or two of them declaring that if the case was so it made a great deal of difference and that they did not wish to be any hindrance to me more particularly as it was quite clear i had been an ostler like themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was late at night when i began to think of retiring to rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on inquiring if there was any place in which i could sleep i was informed that there was a bed at my service provided i chose to sleep in a twobedded room one of the beds of which was engaged by another gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i expressed my satisfaction at this arrangement and was conducted by a maidservant up many pairs of stairs to a garret in which were two small beds in one of which she gave me to understand another gentleman slept he had however not yet retired to rest i asked who he was but the maidservant could give me no information about him save that he was a highly respectable gentleman and a friend of her masters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently bidding me good night she left me with a candle and i having undressed myself and extinguished the light went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> notwithstanding the noises which sounded from every part of the house i was not slow in falling asleep being thoroughly tired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know not how long i might have been in bed perhaps two hours when i was partially awakened by a light shining upon my face whereupon unclosing my eyes i perceived the figure of a man with a candle in one hand staring at my face whilst with the other hand he held back the curtain of the bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i have said before i was only partially awakened my power of conception was consequently very confused it appeared to me however that the man was dressed in a green coat that he had curly brown or black hair and that there was something peculiar in his look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as i was beginning to recollect myself the curtain dropped and i heard or thought i heard a voice say dont know the cove <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was a rustling like a person undressing whereupon being satisfied that it was my fellowlodger i dropped asleep but was awakened again by a kind of heavy plunge upon the other bed which caused it to rock and creak when i observed that the light had been extinguished probably blown out if i might judge from a rather disagreeable smell of burnt wick which remained in the room and which kept me awake till i heard my companion breathing hard when turning on the other side i was again once more speedily in the arms of slumber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been my intention to be up and doing early on the following morning but my slumbers proved so profound that i did not wake until about eight on arising i again found myself the sole occupant of the apartment my more alert companion having probably risen at a much earlier hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having dressed myself i descended and going to the stable found my horse under the hands of my friend the ostler who was carefully rubbing him down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there ant a better horse in the fair said he to me and as you are one of us and appear to be all right ill give you a piece of advice dont take less than a hundred and fifty for him if you mind your hits you may get it for i have known two hundred given in this fair for one no better if so good <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i thank you for your advice which i will take and if successful will give you summut handsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you said the ostler and now let me ask whether you are up to all the ways of this here place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never been here before said i but i have a pair of tolerably sharp eyes in my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that i see you have said the ostler but many a body with as sharp a pair of eyes as yourn has lost his horse in this fair for want of having been here before therefore said he ill give you a caution or two <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon the ostler proceeded to give me at least half a dozen cautions only two of which i shall relate to the reader the first not to stop to listen to what any chance customer might have to say and the last the one on which he appeared to lay most stress by no manner of means to permit a yorkshireman to get up into the saddle for said he if you do it is three to one that he rides off with the horse he cant help it trust a cat amongst cream but never trust a yorkshireman on the saddle of a good horse bythe by he continued that saddle of yours is not a particularly good one no more is the bridle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tell you what as you seem a decent kind of a young chap ill lend you a saddle and bridle of my masters almost bran new he wont object i know as you are a friend of his only you must not forget your promise to come down with summut handsome after you have sold the animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a slight breakfast i mounted the horse which decked out in his borrowed finery really looked better by a large sum of money than on any former occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> making my way out of the yard of the inn i was instantly in the principal street of the town up and down which an immense number of horses were being exhibited some led and others with riders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wonderful small quantity of good horses in the fair this time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard a stout jockeylooking individual say who was staring up the street with his side towards me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he a few moments after i had passed whose horse is that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to look at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though confident that he was addressing himself to me i took no notice remembering the advice of the ostler and proceeded up the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my horse possessed a good walking step but walking as the reader knows was not his best pace which was the long trot at which i could not well exercise him in the street on account of the crowd of men and animals however as he walked along i could easily perceive that he attracted no slight attention amongst those who by their jockey dress and general appearance i imagined to be connoisseurs i heard various calls to stop to none of which i paid the slightest attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few minutes i found myself out of the town when turning round for the purpose of returning i found i had been followed by several of the connoisseurlooking individuals whom i had observed in the fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now would be the time for a display thought i and looking around me i observed two fivebarred gates one on each side of the road and fronting each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turning my horses head to one i pressed my heels to his sides loosened the reins and gave an encouraging cry whereupon the animal cleared the gate in a twinkling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before he had advanced ten yards in the field to which the gate opened i had turned him round and again giving him cry and rein i caused him to leap back again into the road and still allowing him head i made him leap the other gate and forthwith turning him round i caused him to leap once more into the road where he stood proudly tossing his head as much as to say what more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you ask for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> too much for any of you to pay said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a horse like this is intended for other kind of customers than any of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said one the very same person whom i had heard complaining in the street of the paucity of good horses in the fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come let us know what you ask for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i neither more nor less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you call that a great price <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why i thought you would have asked double that amount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do yourself injustice young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps i do said i but thats my affair i do not choose to take more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you would let me get into the saddle said the man the horse knows you and therefore shows to more advantage but i should like to see how he would move under me who am a stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you let me get into the saddle young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said i i will not let you get into the saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lest you should be a yorkshireman said i and should run away with the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the man i am from suffolk silly suffolk so you need not be afraid of my running away with the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if thats the case said i i should be afraid that the horse would run away with you so i will by no means let you mount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you let me look in his mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you please said i but i tell you hes apt to bite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he can scarcely be a worse bite than his master said the man looking into the horses mouth hes four off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say young man will you warrant this horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said i i never warrant horses the horses that i ride can always warrant themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you would let me speak a word to you said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a nice horse said he in a half whisper after i had ridden a few paces aside with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a nice horse said he placing his hand upon the pommel of the saddle and looking up in my face and i think i can find you a customer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you would take a hundred i think my lord would purchase it for he has sent me about the fair to look him up a horse by which he could hope to make an honest penny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i and could he not make an honest penny and yet give me the price i ask <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why said the go between a hundred and fifty pounds is as much as the animal is worth or nearly so and my lord do you see i see no reason at all said i why i should sell the animal for less than he is worth in order that his lordship may be benefited by him so that if his lordship wants to make an honest penny he must find some person who would consider the disadvantage of selling him a horse for less than it is worth as counterbalanced by the honour of dealing with a lord which i should never do but i cant be wasting my time here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am going back to the where if you or any person are desirous of purchasing the horse you must come within the next half hour or i shall probably not feel disposed to sell him at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another word young man said the jockey but without staying to hear what he had to say i put the horse to his best trot and reentering the town and threading my way as well as i could through the press i returned to the yard of the inn where dismounting i stood still holding the horse by the bridle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had been standing in this manner about five minutes when i saw the jockey enter the yard accompanied by another individual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is my lord come to look at the horse young man said the jockey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my lord as the jockey called him was a tall figure of about fiveandthirty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had on his head a hat somewhat rusty and on his back a surtout of blue rather the worse for wear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his forehead if not high was exceedingly narrow his eyes were brown with a ratlike glare in them the nose was rather long and the mouth very wide the cheekbones high and the cheeks as to hue and consistency exhibiting very much the appearance of a withered red apple there was a gaunt expression of hunger in the whole countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had scarcely glanced at the horse when drawing in his cheeks he thrust out his lips very much after the manner of a baboon when he sees a piece of sugar held out towards him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he suddenly turning towards me with a kind of smirk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my horse said i are you the person who wishes to make an honest penny by it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he drawing up his head with a very consequential look and speaking with a very haughty tone what do you mean <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we looked at each other full in the face after a few moments the muscles of the mouth of him of the hungry look began to move violently the face was puckered into innumerable wrinkles and the eyes became half closed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said i have you ever seen me before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you are asking yourself that question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> excuse me sir said he dropping his lofty look and speaking in a very subdued and civil tone i have never had the honour of seeing you before that is said he slightly glancing at me again and again moving the muscles of his mouth no i have never seen you before he added making me a bow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never had that pleasure my business with you at present is to inquire the lowest price you are willing to take for this horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my agent here informs me that you ask one hundred and fifty pounds which i cannot think of giving the horse is a showy horse but look my dear sir he has a defect here and there in his near fore leg i observe something which looks very like a splint yes upon my credit said he touching the animal he has a splint or something which will end in one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hundred and fifty pounds sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what could have induced you ever to ask anything like that for this animal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i protest that in my time i have frequently bought a better for who are you sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am in treaty for this horse said he to a man who had come up whilst he was talking and was now looking into the horses mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the man still looking into the horses mouth who am i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah i see close on five said he releasing the horses jaws and looking at me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this new corner was a thin wirymade individual with wiry curling brown hair his face was dark and wore an arch and somewhat roguish expression upon one of his eyes was a kind of speck or beam he might be about forty wore a green jockey coat and held in his hand a black riding whip with a knob of silver wire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i gazed upon his countenance it brought powerfully to my mind the face which by the light of the candle i had seen staring over me on the preceding night when lying in bed and half asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> close beside him and seemingly in his company stood an exceedingly tall figure that of a youth seemingly about oneandtwenty dressed in a handsome riding dress and wearing on his head a singular hat green in colour and with a very high peak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you ask for this horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he of the green coat winking at me with the eye which had a beam in it whilst the other shone and sparkled like mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who are you sir i demand once more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he of the hungry look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why who should i be but jack dale who buys horses for himself and other folk i want one at present for this short young gentleman said he motioning with his finger to the gigantic youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well sir said the other and what business have you to interfere between me and any purchase i may be disposed to make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well then said the other be quick and purchase the horse or perhaps i may <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you think i am to be dictated to by a fellow of your description <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said his lordship begone or what do you ask for this horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the other to me very coolly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hundred and fifty said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shouldnt mind giving it to you said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will do no such thing said his lordship speaking so fast that he almost stuttered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir said he to me i must give you what you ask symmonds take possession of the animal for me said he to the other jockey who attended him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will please to do no such thing without my consent said i i have not sold him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have this moment told you that i will give you the price you demand said his lordship is not that sufficient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said i there is a proper manner of doing everything had you come forward in a manly and gentlemanly manner to purchase the horse i should have been happy to sell him to you but after all the fault you have found with him i would not sell him to you at any price so send your friend to find up another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you behave in this manner i suppose said his lordship because this fellow has expressed a willingness to come to your terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would advise you to be cautious how you trust the animal in his hands i think i have seen him before and could tell you what can you tell of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the other going up to him except that i have been a poor dickyboy and that now i am a dealer in horses and that my father was lagged thats all you could tell of me and that i dont mind telling myself but there are two things they cant say of me they cant say that i am either a coward or a screw either except so far as one who gets his bread by horses may be expected to be and they cant say of me that i ever ate up an ice which a young woman was waiting for or that i ever backed out of a fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he motioning with his finger tauntingly to the other what do you want with a horse except to take the bread out of the mouth of a poor man tomorrow is not the battle of waterloo so that you dont want to back out of danger by pretending to have hurt yourself by falling from the creatures back my lord of the white feather come none of your fierce looks i am not afraid of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact the other had assumed an expression of the deadliest malice his teeth were clenched his lips quivered and were quite pale the ratlike eyes sparkled and he made a half spring a la rat towards his adversary who only laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> restraining himself however he suddenly turned to his understrapper saying symmonds will you see me thus insulted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go and trounce this scoundrel you can i know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the other going up to the person addressed and drawing his hand contemptuously over his face why i beat symmonds in this very yard in one round three years ago didnt i symmonds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he to the understrapper who held down his head muttering in a surly tone i didnt come here to fight let every one take his own part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats right symmonds said the other especially every one from whom there is nothing to be got <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would give you halfacrown for all the trouble you have had provided i were not afraid that my lord plume there would get it from you as soon as you leave the yard together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come take yourselves both off theres nothing to be made here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed his lordship seemed to be of the same opinion for after a further glance at the horse a contemptuous look at me and a scowl at the jockey he turned on his heel muttering something which sounded like fellows and stalked out of the yard followed by symmonds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now young man said the jockey or whatever he was turning to me with an arch leer i suppose i may consider myself as the purchaser of this here animal for the use and behoof of this young gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> making a sign with his head to the tall young man by his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by no means said i i am utterly unacquainted with either of you and before parting with the horse i must be satisfied as to the respectability of the purchaser <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to that matter said he i have plenty of vouchers for my respectability about me and thrusting his hand into his bosom below his waistcoat he drew out a large bundle of notes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are the kind of things said he which vouch best for a mans respectability <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not always said i indeed sometimes these kind of things need vouchers for themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man looked at me with a peculiar look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to say that these notes are not sufficient notes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he because if you do i shall take the liberty of thinking you are not over civil and when i thinks a person is not over and above civil i sometimes takes off my coat and when my coat is off you sometimes knock people down i added well whether you knock me down or not i beg leave to tell you that i am a stranger in this fair and that i shall part with the horse to nobody who has no better guarantee for his respectability than a roll of banknotes which may be good or not for what i know who am not a judge of such things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you are a stranger here said the man as i believe you are never having seen you here before except last night when i think i saw you above stairs by the glimmer of a candle i say if you are a stranger you are quite right to be cautious queer things being done in this fair as nobody knows better than myself he added with a leer but i suppose if the landlord of the house vouches for me and my notes you will have no objection to part with the horse to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none whatever said i and in the meantime the horse can return to the stable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon i delivered the horse to my friend the ostler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlord of the house on being questioned by me as to the character and condition of my new acquaintance informed me that he was a respectable horsedealer and an intimate friend of his whereupon the purchase was soon brought to a satisfactory conclusion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was evening and myself and the two acquaintances i had made in the fair namely the jockey and the tall foreigner sat in a large upstairs room which looked into a court we had dined with several people connected with the fair at a long table dhote they had now departed and we sat at a small sidetable with wine and a candle before us both my companions had pipes in their mouths the jockey a common pipe and the foreigner one the syphon of which made of some kind of wood was at least six feet long and the bowl of which made of a white kind of substance like porcelain and capable of holding nearly an ounce of tobacco rested on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jockey frequently emptied and replenished his glass the foreigner sometimes raised his to his lips for no other purpose seemingly than to moisten them as he never drained his glass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for myself though i did not smoke i had a glass before me from which i sometimes took a sip <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the room notwithstanding the window was flung open was in general so filled with smoke chiefly that which was drawn from the huge bowl of the foreigner that my companions and i were frequently concealed from each others eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the conversation which related entirely to the events of the fair was carried on by the jockey and myself the foreigner who appeared to understand the greater part of what we said occasionally putting in a few observations in broken english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length the jockey after the other had made some ineffectual attempts to express something intelligibly which he wished to say observed isnt it a pity that so fine a fellow as meinheer and so clever a fellow too as i believe him to be is not a better master of our language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i if so i can interpret for him anything he wishes to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deuce you can said the jockey taking his pipe out of his mouth and staring at me through the smoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you speak german vociferated the foreigner in that language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by isten i am glad of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted to say and here he said in german what he wished to say and which was of no great importance and which i translated into english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well if you dont put me out said the jockey what language is that dutch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> high dutch and you speak high dutch why i had booked you for as great an ignoramus as myself who cant write no nor distinguish in a book a great a from a bulls foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a person may be a very clever man said i no not a clever man for clever signifies clerkly and a clever man one who is able to read and write and entitled to the benefit of his clergy or clerkship but a person may be a very acute person without being able to read or write <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never saw a more acute countenance than your own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no soft soap said the jockey for i never uses any <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however thank you for your information i have hitherto thought myself anition clever fellow but from henceforth shall consider myself just the contrary and only whats the word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said the jockey as you say you can speak high dutch i should like to hear you and master six foot six fire away at each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot speak german said i but i can understand tolerably well what others say in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come no backing out said the jockey lets hear you fire away for the glory of old england <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i in german to the foreigner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that will do said the jockey keep it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i thank god that i do not belong to the stupid sluggish germanic race but to a braver taller and handsomer people here taking the pipe out of his mouth he stood up proudly erect so that his head nearly touched the ceiling of the room then reseating himself and again putting the syphon to his lips he added i am a magyar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foreigner looked at me for a moment somewhat contemptuously through the smoke then said in a voice of thunder a hungarian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a voice the chap has when he pleases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> interposed the jockey what is he saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> merely that he is a hungarian said i but i added the conversation of this gentleman and myself in a language which you cant understand must be very tedious to you we had better give it up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep on with it said the jockey i shall go on listening very contentedly till i fall asleep no bad thing to do at most times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you are a countryman of tekeli and of the queen who made the celebrated water said i speaking to the hungarian in german which i was able to do tolerably well owing to my having translated the publishers philosophy into that language always provided i did not attempt to say much at a time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have heard of tekeli and of leau de la reine dhongrie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen a play acted founded on the exploits of tekeli and have read pigault le bruns beautiful romance entitled the barons of felsheim in which he is mentioned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the water i have heard a lady the wife of a master of mine speak of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should say not for i have heard her express a great curiosity about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course not but why do you put all these questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because the water is said to make people handsome and above all to restore to the aged the beauty of their youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tekeli was my countryman and i have the honour of having some of the blood of the tekelis in my veins but with respect to the queen pardon me if i tell you that she was not an hungarian she was a pole ersebet by name daughter of wladislaus locticus king of poland she was the fourth spouse of caroly the second king of the magyar country who married her in  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a great woman and celebrated politician though at present chiefly known by her water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how came she to invent it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if her own account may be believed she did not invent it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after her death as i have read in florentius of buda there was found a statement of the manner in which she came by it written in her own hand on a flyleaf of her breviary to the following effect being afflicted with a grievous disorder at the age of seventytwo she received the medicine which was called her water from an old hermit whom she never saw before or afterwards it not only cured her but restored to her all her former beauty so that the king of poland fell in love with her and made her an offer of marriage which she refused for the glory of god from whose holy angel she believed she had received the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the receipt for making it and directions for using it were also found on the flyleaf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the principal component parts were burnt wine and rosemary passed through an alembic a drachm of it was to be taken once a week etelbenn vagy italbann in the food or the drink early in the morning and the cheeks were to be moistened with it every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the effects according to the statement were wonderful and perhaps they were upon the queen but whether the water has been equally efficacious on other people is a point which i cannot determine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should wish to see some old woman who has been restored to youthful beauty by the use of leau de la reine dhongrie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps if you did the old gentlewoman would hardly be so ingenuous as the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but who are the hungarians descendants of attila and his people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hungarian shook his head and gave me to understand that he did not believe that his nation were the descendants of attila and his people though he acknowledged that they were probably of the same race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> attila and his armies he said came and disappeared in a very mysterious manner and that nothing could be said with positiveness about them that the people now known as magyars first made their appearance in muscovy in the year under the leadership of almus called so from alom which in the hungarian language signifies a dream his mother before his birth having dreamt that the child with which she was enceinte would be the father of a long succession of kings which in fact was the case that after beating the russians he entered hungary and coming to a place called ungvar from which many people believed that modern hungary derived its name he captured it and held in it a grand festival which lasted four days at the end of which time he resigned the leadership of the magyars to his son arpad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this arpad and his magyars utterly subdued pannonia that is hungary and transylvania wresting the government of it from the sclavonian tribes who inhabited it and settling down amongst them as conquerors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after giving me this information the hungarian exclaimed with much animation a goodly country that which they had entered on consisting of a plain surrounded by mountains some of which intersect it here and there with noble rapid rivers the grandest of which is the mighty dunau a country with tiny volcanoes casting up puffs of smoke and steam and from which hot springs arise good for the sick with many fountains some of which are so pleasant to the taste as to be preferred to wine with a generous soil which warmed by a beautiful sun is able to produce corn grapes and even the indian weed in fact one of the finest countries in the world which even a spaniard would pronounce to be nearly equal to spain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here they rested meditating however fresh conquests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh the magyars soon showed themselves a mighty people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides hungary and transylvania they subdued bulgaria and bosnia and the land of tot now called sclavonia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the generals of zoltan the son of arpad led troops of horsemen to the banks of the rhine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them at the head of a host besieged constantinople <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was then that botond engaged in combat with a greek of gigantic stature who came out of the city and challenged the two best men in the magyar army <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am the feeblest of the magyars said botond but i will kill thee and he performed his word having previously given a proof of the feebleness of his arm by striking his battleaxe through the brazen gate making a hole so big that a child of five years old could walk through it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of what religion were the old hungarians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had some idea of a supreme being whom they called isten which word is still used by the magyars for god but their chief devotion was directed to sorcerers and soothsayers something like the schamans of the siberian steppes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were converted to christianity chiefly through the instrumentality of istvan or stephen called after his death st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> istvan who ascended the throne in the year one thousand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was born in heathenesse and his original name was vojk he was the first kiraly or king of the magyars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their former leaders had been called fejedelmek or dukes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the magyar language has properly no term either for king or house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kiraly is a word derived from the sclaves haz or house from the germans who first taught them to build houses their original dwellings having been tilted waggons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many thanks for your account of the great men of your country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great men of my country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have only told you of the well i acknowledge that almus and arpad were great men but hungary has produced many greater i will not trouble you by recapitulating all but there is one name i cannot forbear mentioning but you have heard of it even at horncastle the name of hunyadi must be familiar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be so though i rather doubt it but however that may be i confess my ignorance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never until this moment heard the name of hunyadi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not of hunyadi janos not of hunyadi john for the genius of our language compels us to put a mans christian name after his other perhaps you have heard of the name of corvinus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i have heard the name of corvinus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by my god i am glad of it i thought our hammer of destruction our thunderbolt whom the greeks called achilles must be known to the people of horncastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well hunyadi and corvinus are the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> corvinus means the man of the crow or raven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose that your john when a boy climbed up to a crow or a ravens nest and stole the young a bold feat well befitting a young hero <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by isten you are an acute guesser a robbery there was but it was not hunyadi who robbed the raven but the raven who robbed hunyadi <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this manner hunyadi according to tradition was the son of king sigmond by a peasants daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king saw and fell in love with her whilst marching against the vaivode of wallachia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had some difficulty in persuading her to consent to his wishes and she only yielded at last on the king making her a solemn promise that in the event of her becoming with child by him he would handsomely provide for her and the infant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king proceeded on his expedition and on his returning in triumph from wallachia again saw the girl who informed him that she was enceinte by him the king was delighted with the intelligence gave the girl money and at the same time a ring requesting her if she brought forth a son to bring the ring to buda with the child and present it to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when her time was up the peasants daughter brought forth a fair son who was baptized by the name of john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after some time the young woman communicated the whole affair to her elder brother whose name was gaspar and begged him to convey her and the child to the king at buda <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was not her honor and pascals honor also at stakeas well as their mutual love and happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be folly to hesitate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with a firm hand she placed the key in the lock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the latter was out of order and the drawer was only opened with difficulty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there on some clothes which madame leon had not yet found time to arrange marguerite saw the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she eagerly snatched it up unfolded it and read dear madame leon dear me she muttered here is the name in full <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is an indiscretion which will render denial difficult <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she resumed her perusal your letter which i have just received confirms what my servants had already told me that twice during my absenceon saturday evening and sunday morningyou called at my house to see me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so mademoiselle marguerites penetration had served her well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this talk about anxious relatives had only been an excuse invented by madame leon to enable her to absent herself whenever occasion required <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i regret continued the letter that you did not find me at home for i have instructions of the greatest importance to give you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are approaching the decisive moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have formed a plan which will completely and forever efface all remembrance of that cursed p <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in case any one condescended to think of him after the disgrace we fastened upon him the other evening at the house of madame dargeles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the king stood up in his royal robes by the beak of nisroch ask what you will strangers from the we ought to say its enough honour like the dancer did no lets ask for it said robert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no no im sure the others manners said anthea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but robert who was excited by the music and the flaring torches and the applause and the opportunity spoke up before the others could stop him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give us the half of the amulet that has on it the name ur hekau setcheh he said adding as an afterthought o king as he spoke the great name those in the pillared hall fell on their faces and lay still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all but the queen who crouched amid her cushions with her head in her hands and the king who stood upright perfectly still like the statue of a king in stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was only for a moment though <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then his great voice thundered instantly from nowhere as it seemed sprang eight soldiers in bright armour inlaid with gold and tunics of red and white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very splendid they were and very alarming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will find a way tomorrow to make them speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for without doubt they can tell us where to find the lost a wall of scarlet and white and steel and gold closed up round the children and hurried them away among the many pillars of the great hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they went they heard the voices of the courtiers loud in horror <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve done it this time said cyril with extreme bitterness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it always does said anthea desperately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not see where they were going because the guard surrounded them so closely but the ground under their feet smooth marble at first grew rougher like stone then it was loose earth and sand and they felt the night air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there was more stone and steps down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my belief we really are going to the deepest dungeon below the castle moat this time said cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least it was not below a moat but below the river euphrates which was just as bad if not worse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a most unpleasant place it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dark very very damp and with an odd musty smell rather like the shells of oysters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a torchthat is to say a copper basket on a high stick with oiled wood burning in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by its light the children saw that the walls were green and that trickles of water ran down them and dripped from the roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were things on the floor that looked like newts and in the dark corners creepy shiny things moved sluggishly uneasily horribly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roberts heart sank right into those really reliable boots of his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthea and cyril each had a private struggle with that inside disagreeableness which is part of all of us and which is sometimes called the old adamand both were victors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neither of them said to robert and both tried hard not even to think it this is your doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthea had the additional temptation to add i told you so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sacrilege and impious cheek said the captain of the guard to the gaoler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to be kept during the kings pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i expect he means to get some pleasure out of them tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hell tickle poor little kids said the gaoler <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got kids of my own too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it doesnt do to let domestic sentiment interfere with ones the soldiers tramped heavily off in their white and red and steel and gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gaoler with a bunch of big keys in his hand stood looking pityingly at the children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook his head twice and went out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know it will be all right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its only a dream really you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe about time being only a something or other of thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a dream its all my doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it really is all up do please not keep a what he had forgotten was that his father was miles and or more years away from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all right bobs old man said cyril and anthea got hold of roberts hand and squeezed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the gaoler came back with a platter of hard flat cakes made of coarse grain very different from the creamandjuicydate feasts of the palace also a pitcher of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh thank you so very much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are kind said anthea feverishly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> go to sleep said the gaoler pointing to a heap of straw in a oh dear mr gaoler said anthea whatever will they do to us theyll try to make you tell things said the gaoler grimly and my advice is if youve nothing to tell make up something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then perhaps theyll sell you to the northern nations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> regular good night said three trembling voices which their owners strove in vain to render firm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he went out and the three were left alone in the damp dim vault <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know the light wont last long said cyril looking at the flickering brazier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it any good do you think calling on the name when we havent got the charm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the blank silence of the damp dungeon remained unchanged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what was the name the queen said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know the slave of the great wait a sec said robert though i dont know why you want it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all her muscles tightened and the muscles of her mind and soul if you can call them that tightened too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ur hekau setcheh she cried in a fervent voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh nisroch there was a waiting silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then a cold blue light awoke in the corner where the straw wasand in the light they saw coming towards them a strange and terrible figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont try to describe it because the drawing shows it exactly as it was and exactly as the old babylonians carved it on their stones so that you can see it in our own british museum at this day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will just say that it had eagles wings and an eagles head and the body of a man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it came towards them strong and unspeakably horrible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the creature hesitated then bowed low before them on the damp floor of the dungeon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> speak it said in a harsh grating voice like large rusty keys being turned in locks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the servant of the great ones is your servant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what is your need that you call on the name of we want to go home said robert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nisroch raised his great arm and pointed at the wall of the dungeon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as he pointed the wall disappeared and instead of the damp green rocky surface there shone and glowed a room with rich hangings of red silk embroidered with golden waterlilies with cushioned couches and great mirrors of polished steel and in it was the queen and before her on a red pillow sat the psammead its fur hunched up in an irritated discontented way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a bluecovered couch lay jane fast asleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> walk forward without fear said nisroch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there aught else that the servant of the great name can do for those who speak you are a dear cried anthea not in the least knowing what she she caught the hand of the creature and it was cold and hard in hers like a hand of stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh my good gracious said the queen as they stood before her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meant to let you out the first thing in the morning if i could slip awaybut thanks be to dagon youve managed it for yourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill wake my chief lady and she shall call dont rouse anybody for goodness sake said anthea except she shook jane with energy and jane slowly awoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rittimarduk brought them in hours ago really said the queen but i wanted to have the psammead all to myself for a bit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll excuse the little natural deception?its part of the babylonish character dont you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i dont want anything no no no said anthea with desperate earnestness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thought she knew enough of what the babylonians were like when they were roused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can go by our own magic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you will jane sat up blinking stupidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hold it up and say the word cried cyril catching up the psammead which mechanically bit him but only very slightly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ur hekau setcheh said jane sleepily and held up the charm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there they all were in the diningroom at fitzroy street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jane cried cyril with great presence of mind go and get the jane went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said quickly as the sound of her boots grew less loud on the stairs dont lets tell her about the dungeon and all that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll only frighten her so that shell never want to righto <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said cyril but anthea felt that she could not have said a word to save her life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why did you want to come back in such a hurry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked jane returning with the plate of sand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was awfully jolly in oh yes said cyril carelessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was jolly enough of course but i thought wed been there long enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mother always now tell us what happened to you said cyril to jane when he and the others had told her all about the queens talk and the banquet and the variety entertainment carefully stopping short before the beginning of the dungeon part of the story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it wasnt much good going said jane if you didnt even try we found out it was no go said cyril its not to be got in babylon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well go to some other jolly friendly place where everyone is kind and pleasant and look for oh said jane the queens man with the smooth facewhat was rittimarduk said cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said jane rittimarduk he came for me just after the psammead had bitten the guardofthegates wifes little boy and he took me to the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we had supper with the new little queen from egypt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is a dearnot much older than you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me heaps about egypt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we played ball after supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then the babylon queen sent for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she talked to the psammead and i went to sleep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then you woke me the psammead roused from its sound sleep told the same story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it added what possessed you to tell that queen that i could give wishes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sometimes think you were born without even the children did not know the meaning of rudimentary but it sounded a rude insulting word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont see that we did any harm said cyril sulkily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no said the psammead with withering irony not at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only she happened to wish that she might soon find herself in your then its your fault said robert because you might just as well have made soon mean some moment next year or next thats where you as so often happens make the mistake rejoined the sandfairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i couldnt mean anything but what she meant by soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what she meant was the next time the king happens to go out lion hunting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so shell have a whole day and perhaps two to do as she wishes with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she well said cyril with a sigh of resignation we must do what we can to give her a good time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was jolly decent to us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say suppose we were to go to st jamess park after dinner and feed those ducks that we never did feed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all that babylon and all those years ago i feel as if i should like to see wheres my priceless woven basket of sacred rushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant go out with nothing on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i and then everybody remembered with pain that the bass bag had in the hurry of departure from babylon not been remembered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its not so extra precious said robert hastily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can get them given to you for nothing if you buy fish in farringdon oh said the psammead very crossly indeed so you presume on my sublime indifference to the things of this disgusting modern world to fob me off with a travelling equipage that costs you and it went then and there to sand which as you know meant to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys went to st jamess park to feed the ducks but they went alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthea and jane sat sewing all the afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they cut off half a yard from each of their best green liberty sashes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a towel cut in two formed a lining and they sat and sewed and sewed and sewed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what they were making was a bag for the psammead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each worked at a half of the bag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> janes half had fourleaved shamrocks embroidered on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were the only things she could do because she had been taught how at school and fortunately some of the silk she had been taught with was left over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and even so anthea had to draw the pattern for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antheas side of the bag had letters on itworked hastily but affectionately she would have put travelling carriage but she made the letters too big so there was no room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bag was made into a bag with old nurses sewing machine and the strings of it were antheas and janes best red hair ribbons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at teatime when the boys had come home with a most unfavourable report of the st jamess park ducks anthea ventured to awaken the psammead and to show it its new travelling bag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> humph it said sniffing a little contemptuously yet at the the psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things that people said nowadays <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a creature that had in its time associated with megatheriums and pterodactyls its quickness was really wonderful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its more worthy of me it said than the kind of bag thats given away with a pound of plaice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when do you propose to take i should like a rest from taking you or us anywhere said i want to go to egypt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did like that egyptian princess that came to marry the king in babylon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she told me about the larks they have in egypt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i told her what the bird things on the amulet were like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she the others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of their cleverness in having concealed from jane the terrors they had suffered in the dungeon below the euphrates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> egypts so nice too jane went on because of doctor brewers scripture history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i would like to go there when joseph was dreaming those curious dreams or when moses was doing wonderful i dont care about snakes said anthea shuddering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well we neednt be in at that part but babylon was lovely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had cream and sweet sticky stuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i expect egypts the there was a good deal of discussion but it all ended in everybodys agreeing to janes idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and next morning directly after breakfast which was kippers and very nice the psammead was invited to get into his travelling carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment after it had done so with stiff furry reluctance like that of a cat when you want to nurse it and its ideas are not the same as yours old nurse came in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no nurse dear said anthea were having a lovely time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah said old nurse the royal academy i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont go she cleared away the kipper bones and the teathings and when she had swept up the crumbs and removed the cloth the amulet was held up and the order givenjust as duchesses and other people give it to their coachmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said anthea when cyril had uttered the wonderful name of power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when moses was there added jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there in the dingy fitzroy street diningroom the amulet grew big and it was an arch and through it they saw a blue blue sky and a running river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said cyril and pulled down janes hand with the amulet in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what silly cuckoos we all are he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we darent leave home for a single minute now for fear that what minute be what minute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked jane impatiently trying to get her hand away from cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the minute when the queen of babylon comes said cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some days life flowed in a very slow dusty uneventful stream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children could never go out all at once because they never knew when the king of babylon would go out lion hunting and leave his queen free to pay them that surprise visit to which she was without doubt eagerly looking forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so they took it in turns two and two to go out and to stay in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stayathomes would have been much duller than they were but for the new interest taken in them by the learned gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of purple and gold beads <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like to call the place where i saw it babylon said anthea cautiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pretty fancy said the learned gentleman and quite correct too because as a matter of fact these beads did come from babylon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other three were all out that day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the boys had been going to the zoo and jane had said so plaintively im sure i am fonder of rhinoceroses than either of you are that anthea had told her to run along then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she had run catching the boys before that part of the road where fitzroy street suddenly becomes fitzroy square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think babylon is most frightfully interesting said anthea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do have such interesting dreams about itat least not dreams do sit down and tell me said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she sat down and told <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he asked her a lot of questions and she answered them as well as she could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ones heard of thoughttransference but i never thought i had any power of that sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet it must be that and very bad for you i should he suddenly put a cold thin hand on her forehead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no thank you not at all said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i assure you it is not done intentionally he went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course i know a good deal about babylon and i unconsciously communicate it to you youve heard of thoughtreading but some of the things you say i dont understand they never enter my its all right said anthea reassuringly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not quite so simple when anthea having heard the others come in went down and before she had had time to ask how they had liked the zoo heard a noise outside compared to which the wild beasts noises were gentle as singing birds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the loud hum of many voices came through the open window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a ballet lady then came a clear voice that they knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some blamed foreign lingo one voice replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children rushed to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a crowd was on the road and pavement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle of the crowd plainly to be seen from the top of the steps were the beautiful face and bright veil of the babylonian queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried look outlet the lady pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes a friend nice friend for a respectable house snorted a fat woman with marrows on a handcart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the same the crowd made way a little <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the queen met robert on the pavement and cyril joined them the psammead bag still on his arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish youd come in a different dress if you had to come no said the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i was dressedno i donti wish the psammead blew itself out till the bag was a very tight fit for it and suddenly every man woman and child in that crowd felt that it had not enough clothes on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for of course the queens idea of proper dress was the dress that had been proper for the workingclasses years ago in babylonand there was not much of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the marrowselling woman whatever could atook me to come out this figure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she wheeled her cart away very quickly indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> someones made a pretty guy of youtalk of guys said a man who sold bootlaces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well dont you talk said the man next to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at your i never come out like this ill take my sacred said the bootlaceseller <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wasnt quite myself last night ill own the crowd was all talking at once and getting rather angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no one seemed to think of blaming the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthea bounded down the steps and pulled her up the others followed and the door was shut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blowed if i can make it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the crowd coming slowly to the same mind dispersed followed by another crowd of persons who were not dressed in what the queen thought was the proper way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall have the police here directly said anthea in the the queen leaned against the arm of the horsehair sofa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how else can a queen dress i should like to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our queen wears things like other people said cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i must say she remarked in an injured tone that you dont seem very glad to see me now i have come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but perhaps its the surprise that makes you behave like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet you ought to be used to surprises <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the best magic ive ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how did oh never mind about that now said robert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see youve gone and upset all those people and i expect theyll fetch the police <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we dont want to see you collared and put in you cant put queens in prison she said loftily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh cant oh in that said the queen disparagingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i thought youd the girls shuddered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a hideous city yours is the queen went on pleasantly and what horrid ignorant people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you know they actually can you understand them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course not they speak some vulgar northern dialect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can i really am not going to explain again how it was that the children could understand other languages than their own so thoroughly and talk them too so that it felt and sounded to them just as though they were talking english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said cyril bluntly now youve seen just how horrid it is dont you think you might as well go home again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why ive seen simply nothing yet said the queen arranging her starry veil <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wished to be at your door and i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i must go nobodys allowed to said anthea in haste but look here well take you and show you anything youd like to seeanything you can see she added kindly because she remembered how nice the queen had been to them in babylon even if she had been a little deceitful in the matter of jane and psammead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theres the museum said cyril hopefully there are lots of things from your country there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if only we could disguise you a i know said anthea suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mothers old theatre cloak and the blue silk lacetrimmed cloak did indeed hide some of the queens startling splendours but the hat fitted very badly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had pink roses in it and there was something about the coat or the hat or the queen that made her look somehow not very respectable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh never mind said anthea when cyril whispered this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing is to get her out before nurse has finished her forty winks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think shes about got to the thirtyninth wink come on then said robert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know how dangerous it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets make haste into the museum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any of those people you made guys of do fetch the police they wont think of looking for the blue silk coat and the pinkrosed hat attracted almost as much attention as the royal costume had done and the children were uncommonly glad to get out of the noisy streets into the grey quiet of the museum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> parcels and umbrellas to be left here said a man at the counter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the party had no umbrellas and the only parcel was the bag containing the psammead which the queen had insisted should be brought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not going to be left said the psammead softly so dont ill wait outside with you said anthea hastily and went to sit on the seat near the drinking fountain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont sit so near that nasty fountain said the creature anthea obediently moved to another seat and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed she waited and waited and waited and waited and waited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the psammead dropped into an uneasy slumber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthea had long ceased to watch the swingdoor that always let out the wrong person and she was herself almost asleep and still the others did not come back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite a start when anthea suddenly realized that they had come back and that they were not alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind them was quite a crowd of men in uniform and several gentlemen were there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now go said the nicest of the angry gentlemen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take the poor demented thing home and tell your parents she ought to be if you cant get her to go we must send for the police said the nastiest gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we dont wish to use harsh measures added the nice one who was really very nice indeed and seemed to be over all the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i speak to my sister a moment first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nicest gentleman nodded and the officials stood round the queen the others forming a sort of guard while robert crossed over to anthea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything you can think of he replied to antheas glance of inquiry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kicked up the most frightful shine in there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said those necklaces and earrings and things in the glass cases were all herswould have them out of the cases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tried to break the glassshe did break one bit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody in the place has been at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only got her out by telling her that was the youd have told a whackinger one to get her out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how do you know they dont cut off mummies heads to see how the embalming is done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what i want ill try said anthea and went up to the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do come home she said the learned gentleman in our house has a much nicer necklace than anything theyve got here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see said the nastiest gentleman she does understand i was talking babylonian i think said anthea bashfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my good child said the nice gentleman what youre talking is not babylonian but nonsense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you just go home at once and tell anthea took the queens hand and gently pulled her away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other children followed and the black crowd of angry gentlemen stood on the steps watching them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was when the little party of disgraced children with the queen who had disgraced them had reached the middle of the courtyard that her eyes fell on the bag where the psammead was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish she said very loud and clear that all those babylonian things would come out to me hereslowly so that those dogs and slaves can see the working of the great queens oh you are a tiresome woman said the psammead in its bag but it puffed itself out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next moment there was a crash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the glass swing doors and all their framework were smashed suddenly and completely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the crowd of angry gentlemen sprang aside when they saw what had done this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the nastiest of them was not quick enough and he was roughly pushed out of the way by an enormous stone bull that was floating steadily through the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it came and stood beside the queen in the middle of the courtyard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was followed by more stone images by great slabs of carved stone bricks helmets tools weapons fetters winejars bowls bottles vases jugs saucers seals and the round long things something like rolling pins with marks on them like the print of little birdfeet necklaces collars rings armlets earringsheaps and heaps and heaps of things far more than anyone had time to count or even to see distinctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the angry gentlemen had abruptly sat down on the museum steps except the nice one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood with his hands in his pockets just as though he was quite used to seeing great stone bulls and all sorts of small babylonish objects float out into the museum yard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he sent a man to close the big iron gates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a journalist who was just leaving the museum spoke to robert as he passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the journalist passed through the gates just before they were shut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rushed off to fleet street and his paper got out a new edition within half an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> impertinent miracle at the british museum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people saw it in fat black letters on the boards carried by the sellers of newspapers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some few people who had nothing better to do went down to the museum on the tops of omnibuses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but by the time they got there there was nothing to be seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the babylonian queen had suddenly seen the closed gates had felt the and of course instantly they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here it said theyll come after you and theyll find me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therell be a national cage built for me at westminster and i shall have to work at politics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why wouldnt you leave the what a temper you have havent you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish all the things were back in their places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will that do the psammead swelled and shrank and spoke very angrily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant refuse to give your wishes it said but i can bite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah dont whispered anthea close to its bristling ear its dreadful for us too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps shell wish not she said the psammead a little less crossly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> take me to see your city said the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children looked at each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if we had some money we could take her about in a cab <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people sell this said the queen taking a ring from her finger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd only think wed stolen it said cyril bitterly and put all roads lead to prison with you it seems said the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said anthea and ran up to him with the ring in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said in tones of joy and amazement and took the ring into his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my very own said anthea it was given to ill lend you a pound said the learned gentleman with pleasure and ill take care of the ring for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who did you is it a game <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll be a pretty game if i dont get the money to pay for cabs for her said anthea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sometimes think he said slowly that i am becoming insane does she say that shes the queen of babylon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this thoughttransference is more farreaching than i imagined he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i have unconsciously influenced her too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never thought my babylonish studies would bear fruit like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the pound is the thing i he ran his fingers through his thin hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its undoubtedly a babylonian ringor it seems so to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but perhaps i have hypnotized myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will see a doctor the moment i have she took the sovereign and ran down to the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now from the window of a fourwheeled cab the queen of babylon beheld the wonders of london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buckingham palace she thought uninteresting westminster abbey and the houses of parliament little better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she liked the tower and the river and the ships filled her with wonder and delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how badly you keep your slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how wretched and poor and neglected they seem she said as the cab rattled along the mile end road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they arent slaves theyre workingpeople said jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you suppose i dont know a slaves face when i see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont their masters see that theyre better fed and better no one answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wagesystem of modern england is a little difficult to explain in three words even if you understand itwhich the children didnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have a revolt of your slaves if youre not careful said the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no said cyril you see they have votesthat makes them safe not to revolt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father told me what is this vote <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do i dont know said the harassed cyril its just a vote i see said the queen a sort of plaything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i wish that all these slaves may have in their hands this moment their fill instantly all the people in the mile end road and in all the other streets where poor people live found their hands full of things to eat and drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the cab window could be seen persons carrying every kind of food and bottles and cans as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roast meat fowls red lobsters great yellowy crabs fried fish boiled pork beefsteak puddings baked onions mutton pies most of the young people had oranges and sweets and cake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made an enormous change in the look of the mile end roadbrightened it up so to speak and brightened up more than you can possibly imagine the faces of the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the best wish youve had yet said jane with cordial approval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just by the bank the cabman stopped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint agoin to drive you no further he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out you they got out rather unwillingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wants my tea he said and they saw that on the box of the cab was a mound of cabbage with pork chops and apple sauce a duck and a spotted currant pudding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you pay me my fare he said threateningly and looked down at the mound muttering again about his tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well take another cab said cyril with dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me but the cabman as it turned out was not at all a nice character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took the sovereign whipped up his horse and disappeared in the stream of cabs and omnibuses and wagons without giving them any change at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already a little crowd was collecting round the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on said robert leading the wrong way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were in a narrow street where many gentlemen in black coats and without hats were standing about on the pavement talking very loudly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how ugly their clothes are said the queen of babylon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd be rather fine men some of them if they were dressed decently especially the ones with the beautiful long curved noses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i and of course it was so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment the almost fainting psammead had blown itself out every man in throgmorton street appeared abruptly in babylonian full dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all were carefully powdered their hair and beards were scented and curled their garments richly embroidered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wore rings and armlets flat gold collars and swords and impossiblelooking headdresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a stupefied silence fell on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say a youth who had always been fairhaired broke that silence its only fancy of coursesomething wrong with my rum said his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and your hairs gone black and youve got a beard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my old levinstein dont look so bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how was it donethats what i want to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it conjuring or i think it is chust a ver bad tream said old levinstein to his clerk all along bishopsgate i haf seen the gommon people have their hants full of foodgoot food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes without doubt then im dreaming too sir said the clerk looking down at his legs with an expression of loathing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see my feet in beastly all that goot food wasted said old mr levinstein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a bad the members of the stock exchange are said to be at all times a noisy lot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the noise they made now to express their disgust at the costumes of ancient babylon was far louder than their ordinary row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one had to shout before one could hear oneself speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only wish said the clerk who thought it was conjuringhe was quite close to the children and they trembled because they knew that whatever he wished would come true <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only wish we and of course instantly they did know and they pressed round the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ought to be put down by law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fetch the police two or three voices shouted at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sound like caged lionslions by they say police <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew they would i wish my guards were here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the exhausted psammead was panting and trembling but the queens guards in red and green garments and brass and iron gear choked throgmorton street and bared weapons flashed round the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a judgement on you rosy said his partner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i always said you were too hard in that matter of flowerdew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a the members of the stock exchange had edged carefully away from the gleaming blades the mailed figures the hard cruel eastern faces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but throgmorton street is narrow and the crowd was too thick for them to get away as quickly as they wished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is all a dream cried mr levinstein cowering in a doorway behind his clerk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those foreign brutes are killing everybody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> henry hirsh is down now and prentice is cut in twooh lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and huth and there goes lionel cohen with his head off and guy nickalls has lost and of course instantly it was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the entire stock exchange rubbed its eyes and went back to close to over and either side of seveneights and trunks and kaffirs and steel common and contangoes and backwardations double options and all the interesting subjects concerning which they talk in the street without ceasing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one said a word about it to anyone else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i have explained before that business men do not like it to be known that they have been dreaming in business hours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> especially mad dreams including such dreadful things as hungry people getting dinners and the destruction of the stock exchange <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children were in the diningroom at fitzroy street pale and trembling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the psammead crawled out of the embroidered bag and lay flat on the table its leg stretched out looking more like a dead hare than anything else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank goodness thats over said anthea drawing a deep breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wont come back will she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but we spent a whole precious pound on her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll take all our pocketmoney for not if it was all a dream said robert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wish said all a dream you know panther you cut up and ask i beg your pardon said anthea politely following the sound of her knock into the presence of the learned gentleman im so no said he looking kindly at her through his spectacles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but its extraordinary that you should ask me for i dozed for a few moments this afternoon a thing i very rarely do and i dreamed quite distinctly that you brought me a ring that you said belonged to the queen of babylon and that i lent you a sovereign and that you left one of the queens rings here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ring was a magnificent specimen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish it hadnt been a dream he said smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was really learning to smile quite nicely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthea could not be too thankful that the psammead was not there to grant his wish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will understand that the adventure of the babylonian queen in london was the only one that had occupied any time at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the childrens time was very fully taken up by talking over all the wonderful things seen and done in the past where by the power of the amulet they seemed to spend hours and hours only to find when they got back to london that the whole thing had been briefer than a lightning flash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they talked of the past at their meals in their walks in the diningroom in the firstfloor drawingroom but most of all on the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an old house it had once been a fashionable one and was a fine one still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the banister rails of the stairs were excellent for sliding down and in the corners of the landings were big alcoves that had once held graceful statues and now quite often held the graceful forms of cyril robert anthea and jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day cyril and robert in tight white underclothing had spent a pleasant hour in reproducing the attitudes of statues seen either in the british museum or in fathers big photograph book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the show ended abruptly because robert wanted to be the venus of milo and for this purpose pulled at the sheet which served for drapery at the very moment when cyril looking really quite like the discoboloswith a gold and white saucer for the discwas standing on one foot and under that one foot was the sheet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course the discobolos and his disc and the wouldbe venus came down together and everyone was a good deal hurt especially the saucer which would never be the same again however neatly one might join its uneven bits with seccotine or the white of an egg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope youre satisfied said cyril holding his head where a large lump was rising <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his thumb had caught in the banisters and bent itself back almost to breaking point <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am so sorry poor dear squirrel said anthea and you were looking so lovely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bobs go and hold your hand under the hotwater tap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its what ballet girls do with what book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he came back cyrils head had been bandaged by his sisters and he had been brought to the state of mind where he was able reluctantly to admit that he supposed robert hadnt done it on purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robert replying with equal suavity anthea hastened to lead the talk away from the accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose you dont feel like going anywhere through the amulet she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its about as much as i can stand herelet alone egypt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was indeed hot even on the second landing which was the coolest place in the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets i dont suppose the amulet was ever thereand we might get our fingers frostbitten so that we could never hold it up to get home again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say said jane lets get the psammead and ask its advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the psammead was brought up in its green silk embroidered bag but before it could be asked anything the door of the learned gentlemans room opened and the voice of the visitor who had been lunching with him was heard on the stairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to be speaking with the door handle in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see a doctor old boy he said all that about thoughttransference is just simply twaddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve been id rather go to babylon said the learned gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish youd go to atlantis some time while were about it so as to give me some tips for my nineteenth century article when i wish i could said the voice of the learned gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the door was banged and the visitor came smiling down the stairsa stout prosperous big man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children had to get up to let him pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hullo kiddies he said glancing at the bandages on the head its all right said cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say what was that atlantic place you wanted him to go to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we couldnt help hearing you you talk so very loud you see said jane soothingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> atlantis said the visitor the lost atlantis garden of the hesperides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you can thank you said cyril doubtfully <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked anthea made anxious by a sudden thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well what he wants is a holiday you persuade him to take one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what he wants is a change of scene <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see his head is crusted so thickly inside with knowledge about egypt and assyria and things that you cant hammer anything into it unless you keep hard at it all day long for days and days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you live in the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he went down the stairs three at a time and jane remarked that he was a nice man and she thought he had little girls of his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should like to have them to play with she added pensively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the three elder ones exchanged glances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets go to atlantis he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lets go to atlantis and take the learned gentleman with us said anthea hell think its a dream afterwards but itll why not take him to nice egypt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive had enough of babylon said robert at least for the present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know why he added forestalling the question on janes lips but somehow we have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> squirrel lets take off these beastly bandages and get into he wished to go to atlantis so hes got to go some time and he might as well go with us said anthea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was how it was that the learned gentleman permitting himself a few moments of relaxation in his chair after the fatigue of listening to opinions about atlantis and many other things with which he did not at all agree opened his eyes to find his four young friends standing in front of him in a row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to know that you are dreaming shows that the dream is nearly at an end he told himself or perhaps its only a game like how many miles to babylon? <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he said aloud thank you very it doesnt take any time said cyril time is only a mode of thought you know and youve got to go some time so why not very well said the learned gentleman now quite certain that he was dreaming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthea held out her soft pink hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she pulled him gently to his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to just outside atlantis said cyril and jane said the name of power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> outside an islands all i wont go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont said the psammead kicking and struggling in its bag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but already the amulet had grown to a great arch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cyril pushed the learned gentleman as undoubtedly the firstborn through the archnot into water but on to a wooden floor out of doors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the amulet grew smaller again and there they all were standing on the deck of a ship whose sailors were busy making her fast with chains to rings on a white quayside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rings and the chains were of a metal that shone redyellow like gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everyone on the ship seemed too busy at first to notice the group of newcomers from fitzroy street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who seemed to be officers were shouting orders to the men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they stood and looked across the wide quay to the town that rose beyond it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what they saw was the most beautiful sight any of them had ever seenor ever dreamed of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blue sea sparkled in soft sunlight little whitecapped waves broke softly against the marble breakwaters that guarded the shipping of a great city from the wilderness of winter winds and seas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the quay was of marble white and sparkling with a veining bright as gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the city was of marble red and white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the greater buildings that seemed to be temples and palaces were roofed with what looked like gold and silver but most of the roofs were of copper that glowed goldenred on the houses on the hills among which the city stood and shaded into marvellous tints of green and blue and purple where they had been touched by the salt sea spray and the fumes of the dyeing and smelting works of the lower town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> broad and magnificent flights of marble stairs led up from the quay to a sort of terrace that seemed to run along for miles and beyond rose the town built on a hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the learned gentleman drew a long breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said i say mrwhats your name said robert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he means said anthea with gentle politeness that we never can remember your when i was your age i was called jimmy he said timidly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should feel more at home in a dream like this thank youjimmy said anthea with an effort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed such a cheek to be saying jimmy to a grownup man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jimmy dear she added with no effort at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now the ship was made fast and the captain had time to notice other things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came towards them and he was dressed in the best of all possible dresses for the seafaring life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you to bless of course said cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sorry if it annoys you but were here by magic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we come from the land of the sunrising he went on explanatorily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see said the captain no one had expected that he would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt notice at first but of course i hope youre a good omen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this he pointed to the learned gentleman not at all said anthea hes a very great man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sage dont they call it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we want to see all your beautiful city and your temples and things and then we shall go back and he will a recordsomething written or she added hastily remembering some sudden impulse of confidence made jane pluck the amulet from the neck of her frock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain looked at it curiously but the other three were relieved to notice without any of that overwhelming interest which the mere name of it had roused in egypt and babylon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the stone is of our country he said and that which is engraved on it it is like our writing but i cannot read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and our kings are ten said the captain and the royal line unbroken from poseidon the father of us all has the noble then lead on please said robert though i should like to see that shall be later said the captain just now were afraid thats nothing master said an old sailor who stood near too loud said the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a rather anxious pause then the captain stepped on to the quay and the others followed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do talk to himjimmy said anthea as they went you can find please excuse me he said earnestly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i talk i shall wake no one else could think of anything to say so that it was in complete silence that they followed the captain up the marble steps and through the streets of the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were streets and shops and houses and markets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its just like babylon whispered jane only everythings its a great comfort the ten kings have been properly brought upto be kind to strangers anthea whispered to cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were no horses or chariots in the street but there were handcarts and low trolleys running on thick logwheels and porters carrying packets on their heads and a good many of the people were riding on what looked like elephants only the great beasts were hairy and they had not that mild expression we are accustomed to meet on the faces of the elephants at the zoo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> murmured the learned gentleman and stumbled over a loose stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the people in the streets kept crowding round them as they went along but the captain always dispersed the crowd before it grew children of the sun god and their high priestcome to bless the and then the people would draw back with a low murmur that sounded like a suppressed cheer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many of the buildings were covered with gold but the gold on the bigger buildings was of a different colour and they had sorts of steeples of burnished silver rising above them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are all these houses real gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the temples are covered with gold of course answered the captain but the houses are only oricalchum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its not quite so the learned gentleman now very pale stumbled along in a dazed dont be frightened said anthea we can get home in a minute just by holding up the charm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you rather go back now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we oh no no he pleaded fervently let the dream go on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the high jijimmy is perhaps weary with his magic journey said the captain noticing the blundering walk of the learned gentleman and we are yet very far from the great temple where he stopped at the gate of a great enclosure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to be a sort of park for trees showed high above its brazen wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the party waited and almost at once the captain came back with one of the hairy elephants and begged them to mount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elephant at the zooto ride on him is also glorious but he goes such a very little way and then he goes back again which is always dull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this great hairy beast went on and on and on along streets and through squares and gardens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a glorious city almost everything was built of marble red or white or black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every now and then the party crossed a bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not till they had climbed to the hill which is the centre of the town that they saw that the whole city was divided into twenty circles alternately land and water and over each of the water circles were the bridges by which they had come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now they were in a great square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a vast building filled up one side of it it was overlaid with gold and had a dome of silver <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rest of the buildings round the square were of oricalchum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it looked more splendid than you can possibly imagine standing up bold and shining in the sunlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would like a bath said the captain as the hairy elephant went clumsily down on his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its customary you know before entering the presence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have baths for men women horses and cattle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the high class baths are here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our father the children had never before bathed in baths of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it feels very splendid said cyril splashing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at least of course its not gold its orwhats its name the bathing hall had several great pools sunk below the level of the floor one went down to them by steps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jimmy said anthea timidly when very clean and boiledlooking they all met in the flowery courtyard of the public dont you think all this seems much more like now than i know a little of those nations however said he and i quite agree with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a most discerning remarkmy dear he added awkwardly this city certainly seems to indicate a far higher level of civilization than the egyptian or babylonish follow me said the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now boys get out of the way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he pushed through a little crowd of boys who were playing with dried chestnuts fastened to a string <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remarked robert theyre playing conkers just like they could see now that three walls surrounded the island on which they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the outermost wall was of brass the captain told them the next which looked like silver was covered with tin and the innermost one was of oricalchum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and right in the middle was a wall of gold with golden towers and gates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behold the temples of poseidon said the captain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not he told them what they ought to say and the five people from fitzroy street took hands and went forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are the children of the sun said cyril as he had been told and our high priest at least thats what the captain calls him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have a different name for him at home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked a whiterobed man who stood in the doorway with his arms extended <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jijimmy replied cyril and he hesitated as anthea had done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it really did seem to be taking a great liberty with so learned a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we have come to speak with your kings in the temple of poseidondoes that word sound right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its very odd i can the queen of babylon found that too said cyril its part of oh what a dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whiterobed priest had been joined by others and all were bowing low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> enter he said enter children of the sun with your high in an inner courtyard stood the templeall of silver with gold pinnacles and doors and twenty enormous statues in bright gold of men and women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also an immense pillar of the other precious yellow metal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went through the doors and the priest led them up a stair into a gallery from which they could look down on to the glorious place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ten kings are even now choosing the bull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not lawful for me to behold said the priest and fell face downward on the floor outside the gallery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the roof was of ivory adorned with the three precious metals and the walls were lined with the favourite oricalchum <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the far end of the temple was a statue group the like of which no one living has ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was of gold and the head of the chief figure reached to the roof <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that figure was poseidon the father of the city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stood in a great chariot drawn by six enormous horses and round about it were a hundred mermaids riding on dolphins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten men splendidly dressed and armed only with sticks and ropes were trying to capture one of some fifteen bulls who ran this way and that about the floor of the temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children held their breath for the bulls looked dangerous and the great horned heads were swinging more and more wildly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anthea did not like looking at the bulls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked about the gallery and noticed that another staircase led up from it to a still higher storey also that a door led out into the open air where there seemed to be a balcony <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that when a shout went up and robert whispered got him and she looked down and saw the herd of bulls being driven out of the temple by whips and the ten kings following one of them spurring with his stick a black bull that writhed and fought in the grip of a lasso she answered the boys agitated now we so they crowded out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but very soon the girls crept back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont like sacrifices jane said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she and anthea went and talked to the priest who was no longer lying on his face but sitting on the top step mopping his forehead with his robe for it was a hot day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a special sacrifice he said usually its only done on the justice days every five years and six years alternately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they drink the cup of wine with some of the bulls blood in it and swear to judge truly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they wear the sacred blue robe and put out all the temple fires <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this today is because the citys so upset by the odd noises from the sea and the god inside the big mountain speaking with his thundervoice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but all thats happened so often before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anything could make what would it be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre a sort of rat and every year they come swimming over from the country that no man knows and stay here awhile and then swim away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know rats wont stay on a ship thats going to be wrecked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anything horrible were going to happen to us its my belief those lemmings would know and that may be why theyve fought shy of what do you call this country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked the psammead suddenly putting its head out of its bag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i advise you to get on to the highest ground you can find <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember hearing something about a flood here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here youit turned to anthea lets get home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prospects too wet for my whiskers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girls obediently went to find their brothers who were leaning on the balcony railings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he isbelow said the priest who had come with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ten kings were no longer alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the learned gentlemanno one had noticed how he got therestood with them on the steps of an altar on which lay the dead body of the black bull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the rest of the courtyard was thick with people seemingly of all be calm said the most kingly of the kings he who had lassoed the bull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our town is strong against the thunders of the sea i want to go home whined the psammead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant go without him said anthea firmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard her and began to come towards her through the crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could see from the balcony the seacaptain edging his way out from among the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and his face was dead white like paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he cried in a loud and terrible voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and above his voice came another voice louder more terriblethe voice of the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across the smooth distance of the sea something huge and black rolled towards the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a wave but a wave a hundred feet in height a wave that looked like a mountaina wave rising higher and higher till suddenly it seemed to break in twoone its all thousands of years ago really said robert but his voice trembled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hid their eyes for a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not bear to look down for the wave had broken on the face of the town sweeping over the quays and docks overwhelming the great storehouses and factories tearing gigantic stones from forts and bridges and using them as battering rams against the temples <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great ships were swept over the roofs of the houses and dashed down halfway up the hill among ruined gardens and broken buildings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water ground brown fishingboats to powder on the golden roofs of palaces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the wave swept back towards the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to go home cried the psammead fiercely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said jane and the boys were readybut the learned gentleman had not come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly they heard him dash up to the inner gallery i must see the end of the dream <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rushed up the higher flight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they found themselves in a sort of turretroofed but open to the air at the sides <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the learned gentleman was leaning on the parapet and as they rejoined him the vast wave rushed back on the town <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this time it rose higherdestroyed more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come home cried the psammead thats the last i know it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it pointed with a claw that trembled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried jane holding up the amulet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will see the end of the dream cried the learned gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll never see anything else if you do said cyril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh youll never have the chance if you dont go soon said the psammead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will see the end of the dream said the learned gentleman obstinately <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hills around were black with people fleeing from the villages to the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and even as they fled thin smoke broke from the great white peak and then a faint flash of flame <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the volcano began to throw up its mysterious fiery inside parts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the earth trembled ashes and sulphur showered down a rain of fine pumicestone fell like snow on all the dry land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elephants from the forest rushed up towards the peaks great lizards thirty yards long broke from the mountain pools and rushed down towards the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the snows melted and rushed down first in avalanches then in roaring torrents <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great rocks cast up by the volcano fell splashing in the sea miles away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the end of the dream gasped the learned gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hold up the amulet cried the psammead suddenly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the place where they stood was now crowded with men and women and the children were strained tight against the parapet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the turret rocked and swayed the wave had reached the golden wall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as jane said it the psammead leaped from its bag and bit the hand of the learned gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same moment the boys pushed him through the arch and all followed him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned to look back and through the arch he saw nothing but a waste of waters with above it the peak of the terrible mountain with fire raging from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he staggered back to his chair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh youre here the hand was indeed bleeding rather badly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the psammead had crept back to its bag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the children were very white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never again said the psammead later on will i go into the past with a grownup person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will say for you four you do do we didnt even find the amulet said anthea later still <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course you didnt it wasnt there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the stone it was made of was there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it fell on to a ship miles away that managed i wish you had said anthea and her voice was still rather you never asked me said the psammead very sulkily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im not mr jijimmys friend will have something worth having to put in his article now said cyril very much later indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the learned jijimmy will think its a dream and its ten to one he never tells the other chap a robert was quite right on both points <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a great city swept away by the sea a beautiful country devastated by an active volcanothese are not the sort of things you see every day of the week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when you do see them no matter how many other wonders you may have seen in your time such sights are rather apt to take your breath away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> atlantis had certainly this effect on the breaths of cyril robert anthea and jane <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they remained in a breathless state for some days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the learned gentleman seemed as breathless as anyone he spent a good deal of what little breath he had in telling anthea about a wonderful dream he had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would hardly believe he said that anyone but anthea could believe it she said quite easily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had ceased to talk about thoughttransference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had now seen too many wonders to believe that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in consequence of their breathless condition none of the children suggested any new excursions through the amulet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> robert voiced the mood of the others when he said that they were fed up with amulet for a bit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the psammead it went to sand and stayed there worn out by the terror of the flood and the violent exercise it had had to take in obedience to the inconsiderate wishes of the learned gentleman and the babylonian queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bellarius chose this time of joy and reconciliation to make his confession <end> <end>

<start> <start> cymbeline forgave old bellarius for who could think of punishments at a season of such universal happiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to find his daughter living and his lost sons in the persons of his young deliverers that he had seen so bravely fight in his defence was unlookedfor joy indeed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen was now at leisure to perform good services for her late master the roman general lucius whose life the king her father readily granted at her request and by the mediation of the same lucius a peace was concluded between the romans and the britons which was kept inviolate many years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how cymbelines wicked queen through despair of bringing her projects to pass and touched with remorse of conscience sickened and died having first lived to see her foolish son cloten slain in a quarrel which he had provoked are events too tragical to interrupt this happy conclusion by more than merely touching upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is sufficient that all were made happy who were deserving and even the treacherous iachimo in consideration of his villainy having missed its final aim was dismissed without punishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lear king of britain had three daughters goneril wife to the duke of albany regan wife to the duke of cornwall and cordelia a young maid for whose love the king of france and duke of burgundy were joint suitors and were at this time making stay for that purpose in the court of lear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old king worn out with age and the fatigues of government he being more than fourscore years old determined to take no further part in state affairs but to leave the management to younger strengths that he might have time to prepare for death which must at no long period ensue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this intent he called his three daughters to him to know from their own lips which of them loved him best that he might part his kingdom among them in such proportions as their affection for him should seem to deserve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goneril the eldest declared that she loved her father more than words could give out that he was dearer to her than the light of her own eyes dearer than life and liberty with a deal of such professing stuff which is easy to counterfeit where there is no real love only a few fine words delivered with confidence being wanted in that case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king delighted to hear from her own mouth this assurance of her love and thinking truly that her heart went with it in a ht of fatherly fondness bestowed upon her and her husband onethird of his ample kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then calling to him his second daughter he demanded what she had to say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> regan who was made of the same hollow metal as her sister was not a whit behind in her profession but rather declared that what her sister had spoken came short of the love which she professed to bear for his highness insomuch that she found all other joys dead in comparison with the pleasure which she took in the love of her dear king and father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lear blessed himself in having such loving children as he thought and could do no less after the handsome assurances which regan had made than bestow a third of his kingdom upon her and her husband equal in size to that which he had already given away to goneril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then turning to his youngest daughter cordelia whom he called his joy he asked what she had to say thinking no doubt that she would glad his ears with the same loving speeches which her sisters had uttered or rather that her expressions would be so much stronger than theirs as she had always been his darling and favoured by him above either of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but cordelia disgusted with the flattery of her sisters whose hearts she knew were far from their lips and seeing that all their coaxing speeches were only intended to wheedle the old king out of his dominions that they and their husbands might reign in his lifetime made no other reply but this that she loved his majesty according to her duty neither more nor less <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king shocked with this appearance of ingratitude in his favourite child desired her to consider her words and to mend her speech lest it should mar her fortunes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cordelia then told her father that he was her father that he had given her breeding and loved her that she returned those duties back as was most fit and did obey him love him and most honour him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but that she could not frame her mouth to such large speeches as her sisters had done or promise to love nothing else in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why had her sisters husbands if as they said they had no love for anything but their father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she should ever wed she was sure the lord to whom she gave her hand would want half her love half of her care and duty she should never marry like her sisters to love her father all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who in earnest loved her old father even almost as extravagantly as her sisters pretended to do would have plainly told him so at any other time in more daughterlike and loving terms and without these qualifications which did indeed sound a little ungracious but after the crafty flattering speeches of her sisters which she had seen drawn such extravagant rewards she thought the handsomest thing she could do was to love and be silent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this put her affection out of suspicion of mercenary ends and showed that she loved but not for gain and that her professions the less ostentatious they were had so much the more of truth and sincerity than her sisters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this plainness of speech which lear called pride so enraged the old monarch who in his best of times always showed much of spleen and rashness and in whom the dotage incident to old age had so clouded over his reason that he could not discern truth from flattery nor a gay painted speech from words that came from the heartthat in a fury of resentment he retracted the third part of his kingdom which yet remained and which he had reserved for cordelia and gave it away from her sharing it equally between her two sisters and their husbands the dukes of albany and cornwall whom he now called to him and in presence of all his courtiers bestowing a coronet between them invested them jointly with all the power revenue and execution of government only retaining to himself the name of king all the rest of royalty he resigned with this reservation that himself with a hundred knights for his attendants was to be maintained by monthly course in each of his daughters palaces in turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so preposterous a disposal of his kingdom so little guided by reason and so much by passion filled all his courtiers with astonishment and sorrow but none of them had the courage to interpose between this incensed king and his wrath except the earl of kent who was beginning to speak a good word for cordelia when the passionate lear on pain of death commanded him to desist but the good kent was not so to be repelled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been ever loyal to lear whom he had honoured as a king loved as a father followed as a master and he had never esteemed his life further than as a pawn to wage against his royal masters enemies nor feared to lose it when lears safety was the motive nor now that lear was most his own enemy did this faithful servant of the king forget his old principles but manfully opposed lear to do lear good and was unmannerly only because lear was mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been a most faithful counsellor in times past to the king and he besought him now that he would see with his eyes as he had done in many weighty matters and go by his advice still and in his best consideration recall this hideous rashness for he would answer with his life his judgment that lears youngest daughter did not love him least nor were those emptyhearted whose low sound gave no token of hollowness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when power bowed to flattery honour was bound to plainness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for lears threats what could he do to him whose life was already at his service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that should not hinder duty from speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the honest freedom of this good earl of kent only stirred up the kings wrath the more and like a frantic patient who kills his physician and loves his mortal disease he banished this true servant and allotted him but five days to make his preparations for departure but if on the sixth his hated person was found within the realm of britain that moment was to be his death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and kent bade farewell to the king and said that since he chose to show himself in such fashion it was but banishment to stay there and before he went he recommended cordelia to the protection of the gods the maid who had so rightly thought and so discreetly spoken and only wished that her sisters large speeches might be answered with deeds of love and then he went as he said to shape his old course to a new country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of france and duke of burgundy were now called in to hear the determination of lear about his youngest daughter and to know whether they would persist in their courtship to cordelia now that she was under her fathers displeasure and had no fortune but her own person to recommend her and the duke of burgundy declined the match and would not take her to wife upon such conditions but the king of france understanding what the nature of the fault had been which had lost her the love of her father that it was only a tardiness of speech and the not being able to frame her tongue to flattery like her sisters took this young maid by the hand and saying that her virtues were a dowry above a kingdom bade cordelia to take farewell of her sisters and of her father though he had been unkind and she should go with him and be queen of him and of fair france and reign over fairer possessions than her sisters and he called the duke of burgundy in contempt a waterish duke because his love for this young maid had in a moment run all away like water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then cordelia with weeping eyes took leave of her sisters and besought them to love their father well and make good their professions and they sullenly told her not to prescribe to them for they knew their duty but to strive to content her husband who had taken her as they tauntingly expressed it as fortunes alms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and cordelia with a heavy heart departed for she knew the cunning of her sisters and she wished her father in better hands than she was about to leave him in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cordelia was no sooner gone than the devilish dispositions of her sisters began to show themselves in their true colours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even before the expiration of the first month which lear was to spend by agreement with his eldest daughter goneril the old king began to find out the difference between promises and performances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this wretch having got from her father all that he had to bestow even to the giving away of the crown from off his head began to grudge even those small remnants of royalty which the old man had reserved to himself to please his fancy with the idea of being still a king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could not bear to see him and his hundred knights <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every time she met her father she put on a frowning countenance and when the old man wanted to speak with her she would feign sickness or anything to get rid of the sight of him for it was plain that she esteemed his old age a useless burden and his attendants an unnecessary expense not only she herself slackened in her expressions of duty to the king but by her example and it is to be feared not without her private instructions her very servants affected to treat him with neglect and would either refuse to obey his orders or still more contemptuously pretend not to hear them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lear could not but perceive this alteration in the behaviour of his daughter but he shut his eyes against it as long as he could as people commonly are unwilling to believe the unpleasant consequences which their own mistakes and obstinacy have brought upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> true love and fidelity are no more to be estranged by ill than falsehood and hollowheartedness can be conciliated by good usage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this eminently appears in the instance of the good earl of kent who though banished by lear and his life made forfeit if he were found in britain chose to stay and abide all consequences as long as there was a chance of his being useful to the king his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see to what mean shifts and disguises poor loyalty is forced to submit sometimes yet it counts nothing base or unworthy so as it can but do service where it owes an obligation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the disguise of a serving man all his greatness and pomp laid aside this good earl proffered his services to the king who not knowing him to be kent in that disguise but pleased with a certain plainness or rather bluntness in his answers which the earl put on so different from that smooth oily flattery which he had so much reason to be sick of having found the effects not answerable in his daughter a bargain was quickly struck and lear took kent into his service by the name of caius as he called himself never suspecting him to be his once great favourite the high and mighty earl of kent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this caius quickly found means to show his fidelity and love to his royal master for gonerils steward that same day behaving in a disrespectful manner to lear and giving him saucy looks and language as no doubt he was secretly encouraged to do by his mistress caius not enduring to hear so open an affront put upon his majesty made no more ado but presently tripped up his heels and laid the unmannerly slave in the kennel for which friendly service lear became more and more attached to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor was kent the only friend lear had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in his degree and as far as so insignificant a personage could show his love the poor fool or jester that had been of his palace while lear had a palace as it was the custom of kings and great personages at that time to keep a fool as he was called to make them sport after serious business this poor fool clung to lear after he had given away his crown and by his witty sayings would keep up his good humour though he could not refrain sometimes from jeering at his master for his imprudence in uncrowning himself and giving all away to his daughters at which for sudden joy did weep and he for sorrow sung that such a king should play bopeep and go the fools among <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in such wild sayings and scraps of songs of which he had plenty this pleasant honest fool poured out his heart even in the presence of goneril herself in many a bitter taunt and jest which cut to the quick such as comparing the king to the hedgesparrow who feeds the young of the cuckoo till they grow old enough and then has its head bit off for its pains and saying that an ass may know when the cart draws the horse meaning that lears daughters that ought to go behind now ranked before their father and that lear was no longer lear but the shadow of lear for which free speeches he was once or twice threatened to be whipped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the coolness and falling off of respect which lear had begun to perceive were not all which this foolish fond father was to suffer from his unworthy daughter she now plainly told him that his staying in her palace was inconvenient so long as he insisted upon keeping up an establishment of a hundred knights that this establishment was useless and expensive and only served to kill her court with riot and feasting and she prayed him that he would lessen their number and keep none but old men about him such as himself and fitting his age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lear at first could not believe his eyes or ears nor that it was his daughter who spoke so unkindly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not believe that she who had received a crown from him could seek to cut off his train and grudge him the respect due to his old age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she persisting in her undutiful demand the old mans rage was so excited that he called her a detested kite and said that she spoke an untruth and so indeed she did for the hundred knights were all men of choice behaviour and sobriety of manners skilled in all particulars of duty and not given to rioting or feasting as she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he bid his horses to be prepared for he would go to his other daughter regan he and his hundred knights and he spoke of ingratitude and said it was a marblehearted devil and showed more hideous in a child than the seamonster <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he cursed his eldest daughter goneril so as was terrible to hear praying that she might never have a child or if she had that it might live to return that scorn and contempt upon her which she had shown to him that she might feel how sharper than a serpents tooth it was to have a thankless child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and gonerils husband the duke of albany beginning to excuse himself for any share which lear might suppose he had in the unkindness lear would not hear him out but in a rage ordered his horses to be saddled and set out with his followers for the abode of regan his other daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and lear thought to himself how small the fault of cordelia if it was a fault now appeared in comparison with her sisters and he wept and then he was ashamed that such a creature as goneril should have so much power over his manhood as to make him weep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> regan and her husband were keeping their court in great pomp and state at their palace and lear despatched his servant caius with letters to his daughter that she might be prepared for his reception while he and his train followed after <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it seems that goneril had been beforehand with him sending letters also to regan accusing her father of waywardness and ill humours and advising her not to receive so great a train as he was bringing with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this messenger arrived at the same time with caius and caius and he met and who should it be but caiuss old enemy the steward whom he had formerly tripped up by the heels for his saucy behaviour to lear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caius not liking the fellows look and suspecting what he came for began to revile him and challenged him to fight which the fellow refusing caius in a fit of honest passion beat him soundly as such a mischief maker and carrier of wicked messages deserved which coming to the ears of regan and her husband they ordered caius to be put in the stocks though he was a messenger from the king her father and in that character demanded the highest respect so that the first thing the king saw when he entered the castle was his faithful servant caius sitting in that disgraceful situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was but a bad omen of the reception which he was to expect but a worse followed when upon inquiry for his daughter and her husband he was told they were weary with travelling all night and could not see him and when lastly upon his insisting in a positive and angry manner to see them they came to greet him whom should he see in their company but the hated goneril who had come to tell her own story and set her sister against the king her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this sight much moved the old man and still more to see regan take her by the hand and he asked goneril if she was not ashamed to look upon his old white beard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and regan advised him to go home again with goneril and live with her peaceably dismissing half of his attendants and to ask her forgiveness for he was old and wanted discretion and must be ruled and led by persons that had more discretion than himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and lear showed how preposterous that would sound if he were to go down on his knees and beg of his own daughter for food and raiment and he argued against such an unnatural dependence declaring his resolution never to return with her but to stay where he was with regan he and his hundred knights for he said that she had not forgot the half of the kingdom which he had endowed her with and that her eyes were not fierce like gonerils but mild and kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he said that rather than return to goneril with half his train cut off he would go over to france and beg a wretched pension of the king there who had married his youngest daughter without a portion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he was mistaken in expecting kinder treatment of regan than he had experienced from her sister goneril <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as if willing to outdo her sister in unequal behaviour she declared that she thought fifty knights too many to wait upon him that fiveandtwenty were enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then lear nigh heartbroken turned to goneril and said that he would go back with her for her fifty doubled fiveandtwenty and so her love was twice as much as regans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but goneril excused herself and said what teed of so many as fiveandtwenty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he might be waited upon by her servants or her sisters servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so these two wicked daughters as if they strove to exceed each other in cruelty to their old father who had been so good to them by little and little would have abated him of all his train all respect little enough for him that once commanded a kingdom which was left him to show that he had once been a king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that a splendid train is essential to happiness but from a king to a beggar is a hard change from commanding millions to be without one attendant and it was the ingratitude in his daughters denying it more than what he would suffer by the want of it which pierced this poor king to the heart insomuch that with this double illusage a vexation for having so foolishly given away a kingdom his wits began to be unsettled and while he said e knew not what he vowed revenge against those unnatural hags and to make examples of them that should be a terror to the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he was thus idly threatening what his weak arm could never execute night came on and a loud storm of thunder and lightning with rain and his daughters still persisting in their resolution not to admit his followers he called for his horses and chose rather to encounter the utmost fury of the storm abroad than stay under the same roof with these ungrateful daughters and they saying that the injuries which wilful men procure to themselves are their just punishment suffered him to go in that condition and shut their doors upon him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind were high and the rain and storm increased when the old man sallied forth to combat with the elements less sharp than his daughters unkindness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for many miles about there was scarce a bush and there upon a heath exposed to the fury of the storm in a dark night did king lear wander out and defy the winds and the thunder and he bid the winds to blow the earth into the sea or swell the waves of the sea till they drowned the earth that no token might remain of any such ungrateful animal as man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old king was now left with no other companion than the poor fool who still abided with him with his merry conceits striving to outjest misfortune saying it was but a naughty night to swim in and truly the king had better go in and ask but he that has a little tiny wit with heigh ho the wind and the rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> must make content with his fortunes fit and swearing it was a brave night to cool a ladys pride <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus poorly accompanied this once great monarch was found by his everfaithful servant the good earl of kent now transformed to caius who ever followed close at his side though the king did not know him to be the earl and he said alas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> creatures that love night love not such nights as these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this dreadful storm has driven the beasts to their hiding places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mans nature cannot endure the affliction or the fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and lear rebuked him and said these lesser evils were not felt where a greater malady was taxed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the mind is at ease the body has leisure to be delicate but the temper in his mind did take all feeling else from his senses but of that which beat at his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he spoke of filial ingratitude and said it was all one as if the mouth should tear the hand for lifting food to it for parents were hands and food and everything to children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the good caius still persisting in his entreaties that the king would not stay out in the open air at last persuaded him to enter a little wretched hovel which stood upon the heath where the fool first entering suddenly ran back terrified saying that he had seen a spirit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but upon examination this spirit proved to be nothing more than a poor bedlam beggar who had crept into this deserted hovel for shelter and with his talk about devils frighted the fool one of those poor lunatics who are either mad or feign to be so the better to extort charity from the compassionate country people who go about the country calling themselves poor tom and poor turlygood saying who gives anything to poor tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sticking pins and nails and sprigs of rosemary into their arms to make them bleed and with such horrible actions partly by prayers and partly with lunatic curses they move or terrify the ignorant countryfolks into giving them alms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this poor fellow was such a one and the king seeing him in so wretched a plight with nothing but a blanket about his loins to cover his nakedness could not be persuaded but that the fellow was some father who had given all away to his daughters and brought himself to that pass for nothing he thought could bring a man to such wretchedness but the having unkind daughters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from this and many such wild speeches which he uttered the good caius plainly perceived that he was not in his perfect mind but that his daughters ill usage had really made him go mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now the loyalty of this worthy earl of kent showed itself in more essential services than he had hitherto found opportunity to perform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for with the assistance of some of the kings attendants who remained loyal he had the person of his royal master removed at daybreak to the castle of dover where his own friends and influence as earl of kent chiefly lay and himself embarking for france hastened to the court of cordelia and did there in such moving terms represent the pitiful condition of her royal father and set out in such lively colours the inhumanity of her sisters that this good and loving child with many tears besought the king her husband that he would give her leave to embark for england with a sufficient power to subdue these cruel daughters and their husbands and restore the old king her father to his throne which being granted she set forth and with a royal army landed at dover <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lear having by some chance escaped from the guardians which the good earl of kent had put over him to take care of him in his lunacy was found by some of cordelias train wandering about the fields near dover in a pitiable condition stark mad and singing aloud to himself with a crown upon his head which he had made of straw and nettles and other wild weeds that he had picked up in the cornfields <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the advice of the physicians cordelia though earnestly desirous of seeing her father was prevailed upon to put off the meeting till by sleep and the operation of herbs which they gave him he should be restored to greater composure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the aid of these skilful physicians to whom cordelia promised all her gold and jewels for the recovery of the old king lear was soon in a condition to see his daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a tender sight it was to see the meeting between this father and daughter to see the struggles between the joy of this poor old king at beholding again his once darling child and the shame at receiving such filial kindness from her whom he had cast off for so small a fault in his displeasure both these passions struggling with the remains of his malady which in his halfcrazed brain sometimes made him that he scarce remembered where he was or who it was that so kindly kissed him and spoke to him and then he would beg the standersby not to laugh at him if he were mistaken in thinking this lady to be his daughter cordelia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then to see him fall on his knees to beg pardon of his child and she good lady kneeling all the while to ask a blessing of him and telling him that it did not become him to kneel but it was her duty for she was his child his true and very child cordial <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she kissed him as she said to kiss away all her sisters unkindness and said that they might be ashamed of themselves to turn their old kind father with his white beard out into the cold air when her enemys dog though it had bit her as she prettily expressed it should have stayed by her fire such a night as that and warmed himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she told her father how she had come from france with purpose to bring him assistance and he said that she must forget and forgive for he was old and foolish and did not know what he did but that to be sure she had great cause not to love him but her sisters had none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and cordelia said that she had no cause no more than they had <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we will leave this old king in the protection of his dutiful and loving child where by the help of sleep and medicine she and her physicians at length succeeded in winding up the untuned and jarring senses which the cruelty of his other daughters had so violently shaken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us return to say a word or two about those cruel daughters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these monsters of ingratitude who had been so false to their old father could not be expected to prove more faithful to their own husbands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they soon grew tired of paying even the appearance of duty and affection and in an open way showed they had fixed their loves upon another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened that the object of their guilty loves was the same <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was edmund a natural son of the late earl of gloucester who by his treacheries had succeeded in disinheriting his brother edgar the lawful heir from his earldom and by his wicked practices was now earl himself a wicked man and a fit object for the love of such wicked creatures as goneril and regan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it falling out about this time that the duke of cornwall regans husband died regan immediately declared her intention of wedding this earl of gloucester which rousing the jealousy of her sister to whom as well as to regan this wicked earl had at sundry times professed love goneril found means to make away with her sister by poison but being detected in her practices and imprisoned by her husband the duke of albany for this deed and for her guilty passion for the earl which had come to his ears she in a ht of disappointed love and rage shortly put an end to her own life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus the justice of heaven at last overtook these wicked daughters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the eyes of all men were upon this event admiring the justice displayed in their deserved deaths the same eyes were suddenly taken off from this sight to admire at the mysterious ways of the same power in the melancholy fate of the young and virtuous daughter the lady cordelia whose good deeds did seem to deserve a more fortunate conclusion but it is an awful truth that innocence and piety are not always successful in this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the forces which goneril and regan had sent out under the command of the bad earl of gloucester were victorious and cordelia by the practices of this wicked earl who did not like that any should stand between him and the throne ended her life in prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus heaven took this innocent lady to itself in her young years after showing her to the world an illustrious example of filial duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lear did not long survive this kind child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before he died the good earl of kent who had still attended his old masters steps from the first of his daughters ill usage to this sad period of his decay tried to make him understand that it was he who had followed him under the name of caius but lears carecrazed brain at that time could not comprehend how that could be or how kent and caius could be the same person so kent thought it needless to trouble him with explanations at such a time and lear soon after expiring this faithful servant to the king between age and grief for his old masters vexations soon followed him to the grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how the judgment of heaven overtook the bad earl of gloucester whose treasons were discovered and himself slain in single combat with his brother the lawful earl and how gonerils husband the duke of albany who was innocent of the death of cordelia and had never encouraged his lady in her wicked proceedings against her father ascended the throne of britain after the death of lear is needless here to narrate lear and his three daughters being dead whose adventures alone concern our story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when duncan the meek reigned king of scotland there lived a great thane or lord called macbeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this macbeth was a near kinsman to the king and in great esteem at court for his velour and conduct in the wars an example of which he had lately given in defeating a rebel army assisted by the troops of norway in terrible numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two scottish generals macbeth and banquo returning victorious from this great battle their way lay over a blasted heath where they were stopped by the strange appearance of three figures like women except that they had beards and their withered skins and wild attire made them look not like any earthly creatures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macbeth first addressed them when they seemingly offended laid each one her choppy finger upon her skinny lips in token of silence and the first of them saluted macbeth with the title of thane of glamis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the general was not a little startled to find himself known by such creatures but how much more when the second of them followed up that salute by giving him the title of thane of cawdor to which honour he had no pretensions and again the third bid him all hail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a prophetic greeting might well amaze him who knew that while the kings sons lived he could not hope to succeed to the throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then turning to banquo they pronounced him in a sort of riddling terms to be lesser than macbeth and greater <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not so happy but much happier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and prophesied that though he should never reign yet his sons after him should be kings in scotland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they then turned into air and vanished by which the generals knew them to be the weird sisters or witches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while they stood pondering on the strangeness of this adventure there arrived certain messengers from the king who were empowered by him to confer upon macbeth the dignity of thane of cawdor an event so miraculously corresponding with the prediction of the witches astonished macbeth and he stood wrapped in amazement unable to make reply to the messengers and in that point of time swelling hopes arose in his mind that the prediction of the third witch might in like manner have its accomplishment and that he should one day reign king in scotland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> turning to banquo he said do you not hope that your children shall be kings when what the witches promised to me has so wonderfully come to pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that hope answered the general might enkindle you to aim at the throne but oftentimes these ministers of darkness tell us but the wicked suggestions of the witches had sunk too deep into the mind of macbeth to allow him to attend to the warnings of the good banquo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that time he bent all his thoughts how to compass the throne of scotland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macbeth had a wife to whom he communicated the strange prediction of the weird sisters and its partial accomplishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a bad ambitious woman and so as her husband and herself could arrive at greatness she cared not much by what means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she spurred on the reluctant purpose of macbeth who felt compunction at the thoughts of blood and did not cease to represent the murder of the king as a step absolutely necessary to the fulfilment of the flattering prophecy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened at this time that the king who out of his royal condescension would oftentimes visit his principal nobility upon gracious terms came to macbeths house attended by his two sons malcolm and donalbain and a numerous train of thanes and attendants the more to honour macbeth for the triumphal success of his wars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the castle of macbeth was pleasantly situated and the air about it was sweet and wholesome which appeared by the nests which the martlet or swallow had built under all the jutting friezes and buttresses of the building wherever it found a place of advantage for where those birds most breed and haunt the air is observed to be delicate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king entered wellpleased with the place and not less so with the attentions and respect of his honoured hostess lady macbeth who had the art of covering treacherous purposes with smiles and could look like the innocent flower while she was indeed the serpent under it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king being tired with his journey went early to bed and in his stateroom two grooms of his chamber as was the custom slept beside him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been unusually pleased with his reception and had made presents before he retired to his principal officers and among the rest had sent a rich diamond to lady macbeth greeting her by the name of his most kind hostess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now was the middle of night when over half the world nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse mens minds asleep and none but the wolf and the murderer is abroad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the time when lady macbeth waked to plot the murder of the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would not have undertaken a deed so abhorrent to her sex but that she feared her husbands nature that it was too full of the milk of human kindness to do a contrived murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she knew him to be ambitious but withal to be scrupulous and not yet prepared for that height of crime which commonly in the end accompanies inordinate ambition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had won him to consent to the murder but she doubted his resolution and she feared that the natural tenderness of his disposition more humane than her own would come between and defeat the purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so with her own hands armed with a dagger she approached the kings bed having taken care to ply the grooms of his chamber so with wine that they slept intoxicated and careless of their charge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there lay duncan in a sound sleep after the fatigues of his journey and as she viewed him earnestly there was something in his face as he slept which resembled her own father and she had not the courage to proceed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she returned to confer with her husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his resolution had begun to stagger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he considered that there were strong reasons against the deed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place he was not only a subject but a near kinsman to the king and he had been his host and entertainer that day whose duty by the laws of hospitality it was to shut the door against his murderers not bear the knife himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he considered how just and merciful a king this duncan had been how clear of offence to his subjects how loving to his nobility and in particular to him that such kings are the peculiar care of heaven and their subjects doubly bound to revenge their deaths <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides by the favours of the king macbeth stood high in the opinion of all sorts of men and how would those honours be stained by the reputation of so foul a murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in these conflicts of the mind lady macbeth found her husband inclining to the better part and resolving to proceed no further <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she being a woman not easily shaken from her evil purpose began to pour in at his ears words which infused a portion of her own spirit into his mind assigning reason upon reason why he should not shrink from what he had undertaken how easy the deed was how soon it would be over and how the action of one short night would give to all their nights and days to come sovereign sway and royalty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she threw contempt on his change of purpose and accused him of fickleness and cowardice and declared that she had given suck and knew how tender it was to love the babe hat milked her but she would while it was smiling in her face have plucked it from her breast and dashed its brains out if she had so sworn to do it as he had sworn to perform that murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she added how practicable it was to lay the guilt of the deed upon the drunken sleepy grooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and with the velour of her tongue she so chastised his sluggish resolutions that he once more summoned up courage to the bloody business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so taking the dagger in his hand he softly stole in the dark to the room where duncan lay and as he went he thought he saw another dagger in the air with the handle towards him and on the blade and at the point of it drops of blood but when he tried to grasp at it it was nothing but air a mere phantasm proceeding from his own hot and oppressed brain and the business he had in hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> getting rid of this fear he entered the kings room whom he despatched with one stroke of his dagger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as he had done the murder one of the grooms who slept in the chamber laughed in his sleep and the other cried murder which woke them both but they said a short prayer one of them said god bless us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the other answered amen and addressed themselves to sleep again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macbeth who stood listening to them tried to say amen when the fellow said god bless us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but though he had most need of a blessing the word stuck in his throat and he could not pronounce it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again he thought he heard a voice which cried sleep no more macbeth cloth murder sleep the innocent sleep that nourishes life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still it cried sleep no more to all the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glamis hath murdered sleep and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macbeth shall sleep with such horrible imaginations macbeth returned to his listening wife who began to think he had failed of his purpose and that the deed was somehow frustrated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he came in so distracted a state that she reproached him with his want of firmness and sent him to wash his hands of the blood which stained them while she took his dagger with purpose to stain the cheeks of the grooms with blood to make it seem their guilt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> morning came and with it the discovery of the murder which could not be concealed and though macbeth and his lady made great show of grief and the proofs against the grooms the dagger being produced against them and their faces smeared with blood were sufficiently strong yet the entire suspicion fell upon macbeth whose inducements to such a deed were so much more forcible than such poor silly grooms could be supposed to have and duncans two sons fled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> malcolm the eldest sought for refuge in the english court and the youngest donalbain made his escape to ireland <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the kings sons who should have succeeded him having thus vacated the throne macbeth as next heir was crowned king and thus the prediction of the weird sisters was literally accomplished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though placed so high macbeth and his queen could not forget the prophecy of the weird sisters that though macbeth should be king yet not his children but the children of banquo should be kings after him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thought of this and that they had defiled their hands with blood and done so great crimes only to place the posterity of banquo upon the throne so rankled within them that they determined to put to death both banquo and his son to make void the predictions of the weird sisters which in their own case had been so remarkably brought to pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this purpose they made a great supper to which they invited all the chief thanes and among the rest with marks of particular respect banquo and his son fleance were invited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the way by which banquo was to pass to the palace at night was beset by murderers appointed by macbeth who stabbed banquo but in the scuffle fleance escaped <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from that fleance descended a race of monarchs who afterwards filled the scottish throne ending with james the sixth of scotland and the first of england under whom the two crowns of england and scotland were united <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at supper the queen whose manners were in the highest degree affable and royal played the hostess with a gracefulness and attention which conciliated every one present and macbeth discoursed freely with his thanes and nobles saying that all that was honourable in the country was under his roof if he had but his good friend banquo present whom yet he hoped he should rather have to chide for neglect than to lament for any mischance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just at these words the ghost of banquo whom he had caused to be murdered entered the room and placed himself on the chair which macbeth was about to occupy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though macbeth was a bold man and one that could have faced the devil without trembling at this horrible sight his cheeks turned white with fear and he stood quite unmanned with his eyes fixed upon the ghost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his queen and all the nobles who saw nothing but perceived him gazing as they thought upon an empty chair took it for a fit of distraction and she reproached him whispering that it was but the same fancy which made him see the dagger in the air when he was about to kill duncan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but macbeth continued to see the ghost and gave no heed to all they could say while he addressed it with distracted words yet so significant that his queen fearing the dreadful secret would be disclosed in great haste dismissed the guests excusing the infirmity of macbeth as a disorder he was often troubled with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to such dreadful fancies macbeth was subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his queen and he had their sleeps afflicted with terrible dreams and the blood of banquo troubled them not more than the escape of fleance whom now they looked upon as father to a line of kings who should keep their posterity out of the throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with these miserable thoughts they found no peace and macbeth determined once more to seek out the weird sisters and know from them the worst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sought them in a cave upon the heath where they who knew by foresight of his coming were engaged in preparing their dreadful charms by which they conjured up infernal spirits to reveal to them futurity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their horrid ingredients were toads bats and serpents the eye of a newt and the tongue of a dog the leg of a lizard and the wing of the nightowl the scale of a dragon the tooth of a wolf the maw of the ravenous saltsea shark the mummy of a witch the root of the poisonous hemlock this to have effect must be digged in the dark the gall of a goat and the liver of a jew with slips of the yew tree that roots itself in graves and the finger of a dead child all these were set on to boil in a great kettle or cauldron which as fast as it grew too hot was cooled with a baboons blood to these they poured in the blood of a sow that had eaten her young and they threw into the flame the grease that had sweaten from a murderers gibbet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by these charms they bound the infernal spirits to answer their questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was demanded of macbeth whether he would have his doubts resolved by them or by their masters the spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he nothing daunted by the dreadful ceremonies which he saw boldly answered where are they <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they called the spirits which were three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the first arose in the likeness of an armed head and he called macbeth by name and bid him beware of the thane of fife for which caution macbeth thanked him for macbeth had entertained a jealousy of macduff the thane of fife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the second spirit arose in the likeness of a bloody child and he called macbeth by name and bid him have no fear but laugh to scorn the power of man for none of woman born should have power to hurt him and he advised him to be bloody bold and resolute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the king what need i fear of thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but yet i will make assurance doubly sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thou shalt not live that i may tell palehearted that spirit being dismissed a third arose in the form of a child crowned with a tree in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he called macbeth by name and comforted him against conspiracies saying that he should never be vanquished until the wood of birnam to dunsinane hill should come against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macbeth who can unfix the forest and move it from its earthbound roots <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i see i shall live the usual period of mans life and not be cut off by a violent death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but my heart throbs to know one thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell me if your art can tell so much if banquos issue shall ever reign in this kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the cauldron sank into the ground and a noise of music was heard and eight shadows like kings passed by macbeth and banquo last who bore a glass which showed the figures of many more and banquo all bloody smiled upon macbeth and pointed to them by which macbeth knew that these were the posterity of banquo who should reign after him in scotland and the witches with a sound of soft music and with dancing making a show of duty and welcome to macbeth vanished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from this time the thoughts of macbeth were all bloody and dreadful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first thing he heard when he got out of the witches cave was that macduff thane of fife had fled to england to join the army which was forming against him under malcolm the eldest son of the late king with intent to displace macbeth and set malcolm the right heir upon the throne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macbeth stung with rage set upon the castle of macduff and put his wife and children whom the thane had left behind to the sword and extended the slaughter to all who claimed the least relationship to macduff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these and suchlike deeds alienated the minds of all his chief nobility from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such as could fled to join with malcolm and macduff who were now approaching with a powerful army which they had raised in england and the rest secretly wished success to their arms though for fear of macbeth they could take no active part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everybody hated the tyrant nobody loved or honoured him but all suspected him and he began to envy the condition of duncan whom he had murdered who slept soundly in his grave against whom treason had done its worst steel nor poison domestic malice nor foreign levies could hurt him any longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while these things were acting the queen who had been the sole partner in his wickedness in whose bosom he could sometimes seek a momentary repose from those terrible dreams which afflicted them both nightly died it is supposed by her own hands unable to bear the remorse of guilt and public hate by which event he was left alone without a soul to love or care for him or a friend to whom he could confide his wicked purposes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he grew careless of life and wished for death but the near approach of malcolms army roused in him what remained of his ancient courage and he determined to die as he expressed it with armour on his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides this the hollow promises of the witches had filled him with a false confidence and he remembered the sayings of the spirits that none of woman born was to hurt him and that he was never to be vanquished till birnam wood should come to dunsinane which he thought could never be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he shut himself up in his castle whose impregnable strength was such as defied a siege here he sullenly waited the approach of malcolm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when upon a day there came a messenger to him pale and shaking with fear almost unable to report that which he had seen for he averred that as he stood upon his watch on the hill he looked towards birnam and to his thinking the wood began to move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried macbeth if thou speakest false thou shalt hang alive upon the next tree till famine end thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if thy tale be true i care not if thou cost as much by me for macbeth now began to faint in resolution and to doubt the equivocal speeches of the spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not to fear till birnam wood should come to dunsinane and now a wood did move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however said he if this which he avouches be true let us arm and out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no flying hence nor staying here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i begin to be weary of the sun and wish my life at an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with these desperate speeches he sallied forth upon the besiegers who had now come up to the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strange appearance which had given the messenger an idea of a wood moving is easily solved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the besieging army marched through the wood of birnam malcolm like a skilful general instructed his soldiers to hew down every one a bough and bear it before him by way of concealing the true numbers of his host <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this marching of the soldiers with boughs had at a distance the appearance which had frightened the messenger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus were the words of the spirit brought to pass in a sense different from that in which macbeth had understood them and one great hold of his confidence was gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now a severe skirmishing took place in which macbeth though feebly supported by those who called themselves his friends but in reality hated the tyrant and inclined to the party of malcolm and macduff yet fought with the extreme of rage and velour cutting to pieces all who were opposed to him till he came to where macduff was fighting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing macduff and remembering the caution of the spirit who had counselled him to avoid macduff above all men he would have turned but macduff who had been seeking him through the whole fight opposed his turning and a fierce contest ensued macduff giving him many foul reproaches for the murder of his wife and children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macbeth whose soul was charged enough with blood of that family already would still have declined the combat but macduff still urged him to it calling him tyrant murderer hellhound and villain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then macbeth remembered the words of the spirit how none of woman born should hurt him and smiling confidently he said to macduff thou losest thy labour macduff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as easily thou mayest impress the air with thy sword as make me vulnerable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bear a despair thy charm said macduff and let that lying spirit whom thou hast served tell thee that macduff was never born of woman never as the ordinary manner of men is to be born but was untimely taken accursed be the tongue which tells me so said the trembling macbeth who felt his last hold of confidence give way and let never man in future believe the lying equivocations of witches and juggling spirits who deceive us in words which have double senses and while they keep their promise literally disappoint our hopes with a different then live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the scornful macduff we will have a show of thee as men show monsters and a painted board on which shall be written never said macbeth whose courage returned with despair i will not live to kiss the ground before young malcolms feet and to be baited with the curses of the rabble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though birnam wood be come to dunsinane and thou opposed to me who west never born of woman yet will i try the last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with these frantic words he threw himself upon macduff who after a severe struggle in the end overcame him and cutting off his head made a present of it to the young and lawful king malcolm who took upon him the government which by the machinations of the usurper he had so long been deprived of and ascended the throne of duncan the meek amid the acclamations of the nobles and the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram count of rousillon had newly come to his title and estate by the death of his father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of france loved the father of bertram and when he heard of his death he sent for his son to come immediately to his royal court in paris intending for the friendship he bore the late count to grace young bertram with his especial favour and protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram was living with his mother the widowed countess when lafeu an old lord of the french court came to conduct him to the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of france was an absolute monarch and the invitation to court was in the form of a royal mandate or positive command which no subject of what high dignity soever might disobey therefore though the countess in parting with this dear son seemed a second time to bury her husband whose loss she had so lately mourned yet she dared not to keep him a single day but gave instant orders for his departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lafeu who came to fetch him tried to comfort the countess for the loss of her late lord and her sons sudden absence and he said in a courtiers flattering manner that the king was so kind a prince she would find in his majesty a husband and that he would be a father to her son meaning only that the good king would befriend the fortunes of bertram <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lafeu told the countess that the king had fallen into a sad malady which was pronounced by his physicians to be incurable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady expressed great sorrow on hearing this account of the kings ill health and said she wished the father of helena a young gentlewoman who was present in attendance upon her were living for that she doubted not he could have cured his majesty of his disease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she told lafeu something of the history of helena saying she was the only daughter of the famous physician gerard de narbon and that he had recommended his daughter to her care when he was dying so that since his death she had taken helena under her protection then the countess praised the virtuous disposition and excellent qualities of helena saying she inherited these virtues from her worthy father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while she was speaking helena wept in sad and mournful silence which made the countess gently reprove her for too much grieving for her fathers death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram now bade his mother farewell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countess parted with this dear son with tears and many blessings and commended him to the care of lafeu saying good my lord advise him for he is an bertrams last words were spoken to helena but they were words of mere civility wishing her happiness and he concluded his short farewell to her with saying be comfortable to my mother your helena had long loved bertram and when she wept in sad mournful silence the tears she shed were not for gerard de narbon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena loved her father but in the present feeling of a deeper love the object of which she was about to lose she had forgotten the very form and features of her dead father her imagination presenting no image to her mind but bertrams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena had long loved bertram yet she always remembered that he was the count of rousillon descended from the most ancient family in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her parents of no note at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore she looked up to the highborn bertram as to her master and to her dear lord and dared not form any wish but to live his servant and so living to die his vassal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so great the distance seemed to her between his height of dignity and her lowly fortunes that she would day it were all one that i should love a bright bertrams absence filled her eyes with tears and her heart with sorrow for though she loved without hope yet it was a pretty comfort to her to see him every hour and helena would sit and look upon his dark eye his arched brow and the curls of his fine hair till she seemed to draw his portrait on the tablet of her heart that heart too capable of retaining the memory of every line in the features of that loved face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gerard de narbon when he died left her no other portion than some prescriptions of rare and wellproved virtue which by deep study and long experience in medicine he had collected as sovereign and almost infallible remedies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the rest there was one set down as an approved medicine for the disease under which lafeu said the king at that time languished and when helena heard of the kings complaint she who till now had been so humble and so hopeless formed an ambitious project in her mind to go herself to paris and undertake the cure of the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but though helena was the possessor of this choice prescription it was unlikely as the king as well as his physicians was of opinion that his disease was incurable that they would give credit to a poor unlearned virgin if she should offer to perform a cure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the firm hopes that helena had of succeeding if she might be permitted to make the trial seemed more than even her fathers skill warranted though he was the most famous physician of his time for she felt a strong faith that this good medicine was sanctified by all the luckiest stars in heaven to be the legacy that should advance her fortune even to the high dignity of being count rousillons wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram had not been long gone when the countess was informed by her steward that he had overheard helena talking to herself and that he understood from some words she uttered she was in love with bertram and thought of following him to paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countess dismissed the steward with thanks and desired him to tell helena she wished to speak with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what she had just heard of helena brought the remembrance of days long past into the mind of the countess those days probably when her love for bertrams father first began and she said to herself even so it was with me when i was young <end> <end> 
<start> <start> love is a thorn that belongs to the rose of youth for in the season of youth if ever we are natures children these faults are ours though then we think not they are faults <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while the countess was thus meditating on the loving errors of her own youth helena entered and she said to her helena you know i am a mother to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena replied you are my honourable mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are my daughter said the countess again i say i am your mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do you start and look pale at my words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with looks of alarm and confused thoughts fearing the countess suspected her love helena still replied pardon me madam you are not my mother the count rousillon cannot be my brother nor i your daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet helena said the countess you might be my daughterinlaw and i am afraid that is what you mean to be the words mother and daughter so disturb you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena do you love my son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> good madam pardon me said the affrighted helena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again the countess repeated her question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not you love him madam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countess replied give me not this evasive answer helena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come come disclose the state of your affections for your love has to the full appeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena on her knees now owned her love and with shame and terror implored the pardon of her noble mistress and with words expressive of the sense she had of the inequality between their fortunes she protested bertram did not know she loved him comparing her humble unaspiring love to a poor indian who adores the sun that looks upon his worshipper but knows of him no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countess asked helena if she had not lately an intent to go to paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena owned the design she had formed in her mind when she heard lafeu speak of the kings illness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was your motive for wishing to go to paris said the countess was it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena honestly answered my lord your son made me to think of this else paris and the medicine and the king had from the conversation of my thoughts been absent then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countess heard the whole of this confession without saying a word either of approval or of blame but she strictly questioned helena as to the probability of the medicine being useful to the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she found that it was the most prized by gerard de narbon of all he possessed and that he had given it to his daughter on his deathbed and remembering the solemn promise she had made at that awful hour in regard to this young maid whose destiny and the life of the king himself seemed to depend on the execution of a project which though conceived by the fond suggestions of a loving maidens thoughts the countess knew not but it might be the unseen workings of providence to bring to pass the recovery of the king and to lay the foundation of the future fortunes of gerard de narbons daughter free leave she gave to helena to pursue her own way and generously furnished her with ample means and suitable attendants and helena set out for paris with the blessings of the countess and her kindest wishes for her success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena arrived at paris and by the assistance of her friend the old lord lafeu she obtained an audience of the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had still many difficulties to encounter for the king was not easily prevailed on to try the medicine offered him by this fair young doctor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she told him she was gerard de narbons daughter with whose fame the king was well acquainted and she offered the precious medicine as the darling treasure which contained the essence of all her fathers long experience and skill and she boldly engaged to forfeit her life if it failed to restore his majesty to perfect health in the space of two days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king at length consented to try it and in two days time helena was to lose her life if the king did not recover but if she succeeded he promised to give her the choice of any man throughout all france the princes only excepted whom she could like for a husband the choice of a husband being the fee helena demanded if she cured the king of his disease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena did not deceive herself in the hope she conceived of the efficacy of her fathers medicine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before two days were at an end the king was restored to perfect health and he assembled all the young noblemen of his court together in order to confer the promised reward of a husband upon his fair physician and he desired helena to look round on this youthful parcel of noble bachelors and choose her husband <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena was not slow to make her choice for among these young lords she saw the count rousillon and turning to bertram she said this is the man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dare not say my lord i take you but i give me and my service ever whilst i live into your guiding power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why then said the king young bertram take her she is your wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram did not hesitate to declare his dislike to this present of the kings of the selfoffered helena who he said was a poor physicians daughter bred at his fathers charge and now living a dependent on his mothers bounty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena heard him speak these words of rejection and of scorn and she said to the king that you are well my lord i am glad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the king would not suffer his royal command to be so slighted for the power of bestowing their nobles in marriage was one of the many privileges of the kings of france and that same day bertram was married to helena a forced and uneasy marriage to bertram and of no promising hope to the poor lady who though she gained the noble husband she had hazarded her life to obtain seemed to have won but a splendid blank her husbands love not being a gift in the power of the king of france to bestow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena was no sooner married than she was desired by bertram to apply to the king for him for leave of absence from court and when she brought him the kings permission for his departure bertram told her that he was not prepared for this sudden marriage it had much unsettled him and therefore she must not wonder at the course he should pursue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if helena wondered not she grieved when she found it was his intention to leave her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ordered her to go home to his mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when helena heard this unkind command she replied sir i can nothing say to this but that i am your most obedient servant and shall ever with true observance seek to eke out that desert wherein my homely stars have failed to equal my great fortunes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this humble speech of helenas did not at all move the haughty bertram to pity his gentle wife and he parted from her without even the common civility of a kind farewell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> back to the countess then helena returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had accomplished the purport of her journey she had preserved the life of the king and she had wedded her hearts dear lord the count rousillon but she returned back a dejected lady to her noble motherinlaw and as soon as she entered the house she received a letter from bertram which almost broke her heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the good countess received her with a cordial welcome as if she had been her sons own choice and a lady of a high degree and she spoke kind words to comfort her for the unkind neglect of bertram in sending his wife home on her bridal day alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this gracious reception failed to cheer the sad mind of helena and she said madam my lord is gone for ever gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then read these words out of bertrams letter when you can get the ring from my finger which never shall come of then call me husband but in such a then i write a never <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countess begged her to have patience and said now bertram was gone she should be her child and that she deserved a lord that twenty such rude boys as bertram might tend upon and hourly call her mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in vain by respectful condescension and kind flattery this matchless mother tried to soothe the sorrows of her daughter inlaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena still kept her eyes fixed upon the letter and cried out in an agony of grief till i have no wife i have nothing in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countess asked her if she found those words in the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes madam was all poor helena could answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next morning helena was missing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she left a letter to be delivered to the countess after she was gone to acquaint her with the reason of her sudden absence in this letter she informed her that she was so much grieved at having driven bertram from his native country and his home that to atone for her offence she had undertaken a pilgrimage to the shrine of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jaques le grand and concluded with requesting the countess to inform her son that the wife he so hated had left his house for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram when he left paris went to florence and there became an officer in the duke of florences army and after a successful war in which he distinguished himself by many brave actions bertram received letters from his mother containing the acceptable tidings that helena would no more disturb him and he was preparing to return home when helena herself clad in her pilgrims weeds arrived at the city of florence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> florence was a city through which the pilgrims used to pass on their way to st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jaques le grand and when helena arrived at this city she heard that a hospitable widow dwelt there who used to receive into her house the female pilgrims that were going to visit the shrine of that saint giving them lodging and kind entertainment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this good lady therefore helena went and the widow gave her a courteous welcome and invited her to see whatever was curious in that famous city and told her that if she would like to see the dukes army she would take her where she might have a full view of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you will see a countryman of yours said the widow his name is count rousillon who has done worthy service in the dukes wars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena wanted no second invitation when she found bertram was to make part of the show <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she accompanied her hostess and a sad and mournful pleasure it was to her to look once more upon her dear husbands face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is he not a handsome man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i like him well replied helena with great truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the way they walked the talkative widows discourse was all of bertram she told helena the story of bertrams marriage and how he had deserted the poor lady his wife and entered into the dukes army to avoid living with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this account of her own misfortunes helena patiently listened and when it was ended the history of bertram was not yet done for then the widow began another tale every word of which sank deep into the mind of helena for the story she now told was of bertrams love for her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though bertram did not like the marriage forced on him by the king it seems he was not insensible to love for since he had been stationed with the army at florence he had fallen in love with diana a fair young gentlewoman the daughter of this widow who was helenas hostess and every night with music of all sorts and songs composed in praise of dianas beauty he would come under her window and solicit her love and all his suit to her was that she would permit him to visit her by stealth after the family were retired to rest but diana would by no means be persuaded to grant this improper request nor give any encouragement to his suit knowing him to be a married man for diana had been brought up under the counsels of a prudent mother who though she was now in reduced circumstances was well born and descended from the noble family of the capulets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this the good lady related to helena highly praising the virtuous principles of her discreet daughter which she said were entirely owing to the excellent education and good advice she had given her and she further said that bertram had been particularly importunate with diana to admit him to the visit he so much desired that night because he was going to leave florence early the next morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though it grieved helena to hear of bertrams love for the widows daughter yet from the story the ardent mind of helena conceived a project nothing discouraged at the ill success of her former one to recover her truant lord <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she disclosed to the widow that she was helena the deserted wife of bertram and requested that her kind hostess and her daughter would suffer this visit from bertram to take place and allow her to pass herself upon bertram for diana telling them her chief motive for desiring to have this secret meeting with her husband was to get a ring from him which he had said if ever she was in possession of he would acknowledge her as his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the widow and her daughter promised to assist her in this affair partly moved by pity for this unhappy forsaken wife and partly won over to her interest by the promises of reward which helena made them giving them a purse of money in earnest of her future favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the course of that day helena caused information to be sent to bertram that she was dead hoping that when he thought himself free to make a second choice by the news of her death he would offer marriage to her in her feigned character of diana <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if she could obtain the ring and this promise too she doubted not she should make some future good come of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the evening after it was dark bertram was admitted into dianas chamber and helena was there ready to receive him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the flattering compliments and love discourse he addressed to helena were precious sounds to her though she knew they were meant for diana and bertram was so well pleased with her that he made her a solemn promise to be her husband and to love her for ever which she hoped would be prophetic of a real affection when he should know it was his own wife the despised helena whose conversation had so delighted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram never knew how sensible a lady helena was else perhaps he would not have been so regardless of her and seeing her every day he had entirely overlooked her beauty a face we are accustomed to see constantly losing the effect which is caused by the first sight either of beauty or of plainness and of her understanding it was impossible he should judge because she felt such reverence mixed with her love for him that she was always silent in his presence but now that her future fate and the happy ending of all her loveprojects seemed to depend on her leaving a favourable impression on the mind of bertram from this nights interview she exerted all her wit to please him and the simple graces of her lively conversation and the endearing sweetness of her manners so charmed bertram that he vowed she should be his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena begged the ring from off his finger as a token of his regard and he gave it to her and in return for this ring which it was of such importance to her to possess she gave him another ring which was one the king had made her a present of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before it was light in the morning she sent bertram away and he immediately set out on his journey towards his mothers house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena prevailed on the widow and diana to accompany her to paris their further assistance being necessary to the full accomplishment of the plan she had formed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they arrived there they found the king was gone upon a visit to the countess of rousillon and helena followed the king with all the speed she could make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king was still in perfect health and his gratitude to her who had been the means of his recovery was so lively in his mind that the moment he saw the countess of rousillon he began to talk of helena calling her a precious jewel that was lost by the folly of her son but seeing the subject distressed the countess who sincerely lamented the death of helena he said my good lady i have forgiven and forgotten all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the goodnatured old lafeu who was present and could not bear that the memory of his favourite helena should be so lightly passed over said this i must say the young lord did great offence to his majesty his mother and his lady but to himself he did the greatest wrong of all for he has lost a wife whose beauty astonished all eyes whose words took all ears captive whose deep perfection made all hearts wish to serve her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king said praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well call him hither meaning bertram who now presented himself before the king and on his expressing deep sorrow for the injuries he had done to helena the king for his dead fathers and his admirable mothers sake pardoned him and restored him once more to his favour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the gracious countenance of the king was soon changed towards him for he perceived that bertram wore the very ring upon his finger which he had given to helena and he well remembered that helena had called all the saints in heaven to witness she would never part with that ring unless she sent it to the king himself upon some great disaster befalling her and bertram on the kings questioning him how he came by the ring told an improbable story of a lady throwing it to him out of a window and denied ever having seen helena since the day of their marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king knowing bertrams dislike to his wife feared he had destroyed her and he ordered his guards to seize bertram saying i am wrapt in dismal thinking for i fear the life of helena was foully snatched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this moment diana and her mother entered and presented a petition to the king wherein they begged his majesty to exert his royal power to compel bertram to marry diana he having made her a solemn promise of marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram fearing the kings anger denied he had made any such promise and then diana produced the ring which helena had put into her hands to confirm the truth of her words and she said that she had given bertram the ring he then wore in exchange for that at the time he vowed to marry her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on hearing this the king ordered the guards to seize her also and her account of the ring differing from bertrams the kings suspicions were confirmed and he said if they did not confess how they came by this ring of helenas they should be both put to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> diana requested her mother might be permitted to fetch the jeweller of whom she bought the ring which being granted the widow went out and presently returned leading in helena herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the good countess who in silent grief had beheld her sons danger and had even dreaded that the suspicion of his having destroyed his wife might possibly be true finding her dear helena whom she loved with even a maternal affection was still living felt a delight she was hardly able to support and the king scarce believing for joy that it was helena said is this indeed the wife of bertram that i see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena feeling herself yet an unacknowledged wife replied no my good lord it is but the shadow of a wife you see the name and not the thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o my lord said helena when i personated this fair maid i found you wondrous kind and look here is your letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reading to him in a joyful tone those words which she had once repeated so sorrowfully when from my finger you can get this ring this is done it was to me you gave the ring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> will you be mine now you are doubly won <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram replied if you can make it plain that you were the lady i talked with that night i will love you dearly ever ever dearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was no difficult task for the widow and diana came with helena to prove this fact and the king was so well pleased with diana for the friendly assistance she had rendered the dear lady he so truly valued for the service she had done him that he promised her also a noble husband helenas history giving him a hint that it was a suitable reward for kings to bestow upon fair ladies when they perform notable services <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus helena at last found that her fathers legacy was indeed sanctified by the luckiest stars in heaven for she was now the beloved wife of her dear bertram the daughterinlaw of her noble mistress and herself the countess of rousillon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katharine the shrew was the eldest daughter of baptista a rich gentleman of padua <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was a lady of such an ungovernable spirit and fiery temper such a loudtongued scold that she was known in padua by no other name than katharine the shrew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed very unlikely indeed impossible that any gentleman would ever be found who would venture to marry this lady and therefore baptista was much blamed for deferring his consent to many excellent offers that were made to her gentle sister bianca putting off all biancas suitors with this excuse that when the eldest sister was fairly off his hands they should have free leave to address young bianca <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it happened however that a gentleman named petruchio came to padua purposely to look out for a wife who nothing discouraged by these reports of katharines temper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and hearing she was rich and handsome resolved upon marrying this famous termagant and taming her into a meek and manageable wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and truly none was so fit to set about this herculean labour as petruchio whose spirit was as high as katharines and he was a witty and most happytempered humourist and withal so wise and of such a true judgment that he well knew how to feign a passionate and furious deportment when his spirits were so calm that himself could have laughed merrily at his own angry feigning for his natural temper was careless and easy the boisterous airs he assumed when he became the husband of katharine being but in sport or more properly speaking affected by his excellent discernment as the only means to overcome in her own way the passionate ways of the furious katharine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a courting then petruchio went to katharine the shrew and first of all he applied to baptista her father for leave to woo his gentle daughter katharine as petruchio called her saying archly that having heard of her bashful modesty and mild behaviour he had come from verona to solicit her love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her father though he wished her married was forced to confess katharine would ill answer this character it being soon apparent of what manner of gentleness she was composed for her musicmaster rushed into the room to complain that the gentle katharine his pupil had broken his head with her lute for presuming to find fault with her performance which when petruchio heard he said it is a brave wench i love her more than ever and long to have some chat with her and hurrying the old gentleman for a positive answer he said my business is in haste signior baptista i cannot come every day to woo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you knew my father he is dead and has left me heir to all his lands and goods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tell me if i get your daughters love what dowry you will give with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baptista thought his manner was somewhat blunt for a lover but being glad to get katharine married he answered that he would give her twenty thousand crowns for her dowry and half his estate at his death so this odd match was quickly agreed on and baptista went to apprise his shrewish daughter of her lovers addresses and sent her in to petruchio to listen to his suit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime petruchio was settling with himself the mode of courtship he should pursue and he said i will woo her with some spirit when she comes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she rails at me why then i will tell her she sings as sweetly as a nightingale and if she frowns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will say she looks as clear as roses newly washed with dew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she will not speak a word i will praise the eloquence of her language and if she bids me leave her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will give her thanks as if she bid me stay with her a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the stately katharine entered and petruchio first addressed her with good morrow kate for that is your name i hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katharine not liking this plain salutation said disdainfully they call me katharine who do speak to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you lie replied the lover for you are called plain kate and bonny kate and sometimes kate the shrew but kate you are the prettiest kate in christendom and therefore kate hearing your mildness praised in every town i am come to woo you for my a strange courtship they made of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she in loud and angry terms showing him how justly she had gained the name of shrew while he still praised her sweet and courteous words till at length hearing her father coming he said intending to make as quick a wooing as possible sweet katharine let us set this idle chat aside for your father has consented that you shall be my wife your dowry is agreed and now baptista entering petruchio told him his daughter had received him kindly and that she had promised to be married the next sunday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this katharine denied saying she would rather see him hanged on sunday and reproached her father for wishing to wed her to such a madcap ruffian as petruchio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petruchio desired her father not to regard her angry words for they had agreed she should seem reluctant before him but that when they were alone he had found her very fond and loving and he said to her give me your hand kate i will go to venice to buy you fine apparel against our wedding day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> provide the feast father and bid the wedding guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will be sure to bring rings fine array and rich clothes that my katharine may be on the sunday all the wedding guests were assembled but they waited long before petruchio came and katharine wept for vexation to think that petruchio had only been making a jest of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last however he appeared but he brought none of the bridal finery he had promised katharine nor was he dressed himself like a bridegroom but in strange disordered attire as if he meant to make a sport of the serious business he came about and his servant and the very horses on which they rode were in like manner in mean and fantastic fashion habited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petruchio could not be persuaded to change his dress he said katharine was to be married to him and not to his clothes and finding it was in vain to argue with him to the church they went he still behaving in the same mad way for when the priest asked petruchio if katharine should be his wife he swore so loud that she should that all amazed the priest let fall his book and as he stooped to take it up this madbrained bridegroom gave him such a cuff that down fell the priest and his book again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the while they were being married he stamped and swore so that the highspirited katharine trembled and shook with fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the ceremony was over while they were yet in the church he called for wine and drank a loud health to the company and threw a sop which was at the bottom of the glass full in the sextons face giving no other reason for this strange act than that the sextons beard grew thin and hungerly and seemed to ask the sop as he was drinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never sure was there such a mad marriage but petruchio did but put this wildness on the better to succeed in the plot he had formed to tame his shrewish wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> baptista had provided a sumptuous marriage feast but when they returned from church petruchio taking hold of katharine declared his intention of carrying his wife home instantly and no remonstrance of his fatherinlaw or angry words of the enraged katharine could make him change his purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he claimed a husbands right to dispose of his wife as he pleased and away he hurried katharine off he seeming so daring and resolute that no one dared attempt to stop him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petruchio mounted his wife upon a miserable horse lean and lank which he had picked out for the purpose and himself and his servant no better mounted they journeyed on through rough and miry ways and ever when this horse of katharines stumbled he would storm and swear at the poor jaded beast who could scarce crawl under his burthen as if he had been the most passionate man alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length after a weary journey during which katharine had heard nothing but the wild ravings of petruchio at the servant and the horses they arrived at his house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petruchio welcomed her kindly to her home but he resolved she should have neither rest nor food that night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tables were spread and supper soon served but petruchio pretending to find fault with every dish threw the meat about the floor and ordered the servants to remove it away and all this he did as he said in love for his katharine that she might not eat meat that was not well dressed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when katharine weary and supperless retired to rest he found the same fault with the bed throwing the pillows and bedclothes about the room so that she was forced to sit down in a chair where if she chanced to drop asleep she was presently awakened by the loud voice of her husband storming at the servants for the illmaking of his wifes bridalbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day petruchio pursued the same course still speaking kind words to katharine but when she attempted to eat finding fault with everything that was set before her throwing the breakfast on the floor as he had done the supper and katharine the haughty katherine was fain to beg the servants would bring her secretly a morsel of food but they being instructed by petruchio replied they dared not give her anything unknown to their master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah said she did he marry me to famish me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beggars that come to my fathers door have food given them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i who never knew what it was to entreat for anything am starved for want of food giddy for want of sleep with oaths kept waking and with brawling fed and that which vexes me more than all he does it under the name of perfect love pretending that if i sleep or eat it were present death to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the soliloquy was interrupted by the entrance of petruchio he not meaning she should be quite starved had brought her a small portion of meat and he said to her how fares my sweet kate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here love you see how diligent i am i have dressed your meat myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am sure this kindness merits thanks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay then you love not the meat and all the pains i have taken is to no purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then ordered the servant to take the dish away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> extreme hunger which had abated the pride of katharine made her say though angered to the heart i pray you let it stand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this was not all petruchio intended to bring her to and he replied the poorest service is repaid with thanks and so shall mine before you touch the meat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this katharine brought out a reluctant i thank you sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he suffered her to make a slender meal saying much good may it do your gentle heart kate eat apace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now my honey love we will return to your fathers house and revel it as bravely as the best with silken coats and caps and golden rings with ruffs and scares and fans and double change of finery and to make her believe he really intended to give her these gay things he called in a tailor and a haberdasher who brought some new clothes he had ordered for her and then giving her plate to the servant to take away before she had half satisfied her hunger he said what have you dined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the haberdasher presented a cap saying here is the cap your worship bespoke on which petruchio began to storm afresh saying the cap was moulded in a porringer and that it was no bigger than a cockle or walnut shell desiring the haberdasher to take it away and make it bigger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katharine said i will have this all gentlewomen wear such caps as these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when you are gentle replied petruchio you shall have one too and not till then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the meat katharine had eaten had a little revived her fallen spirits and she said why sir i trust i may have leave to speak and speak i will i am no child no babe your betters have endured to hear me say my mind and if you cannot you had better stop your ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petruchio would not hear these angry words for he had happily discovered a better way of managing his wife than keeping up a jangling argument with her therefore his answer was why you say true it is a paltry cap and i love you for not liking it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> love me or love me not said katharine i like the cap and i will have this cap or none <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you say you wish to see the gown said petruchio still affecting to misunderstand her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tailor then came forward and showed her a fine gown he had made for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petruchio whose intent was that she should have neither cap nor gown found as much fault with that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he what stuff is here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do you call this a sleeve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is like a demicannon carved up and down like an apple tart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tailor said you bid me make it according to the fashion of the times and katharine said she never saw a better fashioned gown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was enough for petruchio and privately desiring these people might be paid for their goods and excuses made to them for the seemingly strange treatment he bestowed upon them he with fierce words and furious gestures drove the tailor and the haberdasher out of the room and then turning to katharine he said well come my kate we will go to your fathers even in these mean garments we now wear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then he ordered his horses affirming they should reach baptistas house by dinnertime for that it was but seven oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it was not early morning but the very middle of the day when he spoke this therefore katharine ventured to say though modestly being almost overcome by the vehemence of his manner i dare assure you sir it is two oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and will be suppertime before we get there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but petruchio meant that she should be so completely subdued that she should assent to everything he said before he carried her to her father and therefore as if he were lord even of the sun and could command the hours he said it should be what time he pleased to have it before he set forward for he said whatever i say or do you still are crossing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will not go to day and when i go it shall be what oclock i say it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another day katherine was forced to practice her newly found obedience and not till he had brought her proud spirit to such a perfect subjection that she dared not remember there was such a word as contradiction would petruchio allow her to go to her fathers house and even while they were upon their journey thither she was in danger of being turned back again only because she happened to hint it was the sun when he affirmed the moon shone brightly at noonday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now by my mothers son said he and that is myself it shall be the moon or stars or what i list before i journey to your fathers house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then made as if he were going back again but katherine no longer katherine the shrew but the obedient wife said let us go forward i pray now we have come so far and it shall be the sun or moon or what you please and if you please to call it a rush candle henceforth i vowed it shall be so for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this he was resolved to prove therefore he said again i say it is the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know it is the moon replied katherine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you lie it is the blessed sun said petruchio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it is the blessed sun replied katherine but sun it is not when you say it is not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what you will have it named even so it is and so it ever shall be for katherine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now then he suffered her to proceed on her journey but further to try if this yielding humour would last he addressed an old gentleman they met on the road as if he had been a young woman saying to him good morrow gentle mistress and asked katherine if she had ever beheld a fairer gentlewoman praising the red and white of the old mans cheeks and comparing his eyes to two bright stars and again he addressed him saying fair lovely maid once more good day to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and said to his wife sweet kate embrace her for her beautys sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the now completely vanquished katharine quickly adopted her husbands opinion and made her speech in like sort to the old gentleman saying to him young budding virgin you are fair and fresh and sweet whither are you going and where is your dwelling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> happy are the parents of so fair a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why how now kate said petruchio i hope you are not mad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a man old and wrinkled faded and withered and not a maiden as you say he is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this katharine said pardon me old gentleman the sun has so dazzled my eyes that everything i look on seemeth green <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i perceive you are a reverend father i hope you will pardon me for my sad mistake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do good old grandsire said petruchio and tell us which way you are travelling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall be glad of your good company if you are going our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old gentleman replied fair sir and you my merry mistress your strange encounter has much amazed me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my name is vincentio and i am going to visit a son of mine who lives at padua <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then petruchio knew the old gentleman to e the father of lucentio a young gentleman who was to be married to baptistas younger daughter bianca and he made vincentio very happy by telling him the rich marriage his son was about to make and they all journeyed on pleasantly together till they came to baptistas house where there was a large company assembled to celebrate the wedding of bianca and lucentio baptista having willingly consented to the marriage of bianca when he had got katharine off his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they entered baptista welcomed them to the wedding feast and there was present also another newly married pair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucentio biancas husband and hortensio the other new married man could not forbear sly jests which seemed to hint at the shrewish disposition of petruchios wife and these fond bridegrooms seemed high pleased with the mild tempers of the ladies they had chosen laughing at petruchio for his less fortunate choice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> petruchio took little notice of their jokes till the ladies were retired after dinner and then he perceived baptista himself joined in the laugh against him for when petruchio affirmed that his wife would prove more obedient than theirs the father of katharine said now in good sadness son petruchio i fear you have got the veriest shrew of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well said petruchio i say no and therefore for assurance that i speak the truth let us each one send for his wife and he whose wife is most obedient to come at first when she is sent for shall win a wager which we will propose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to this the other two husbands willingly consented for they were quite confident that their gentle wives would prove more obedient than the headstrong katharine and they proposed a wager of twenty crowns but petruchio merrily said he would lay as much as that upon his hawk or hound but twenty times as much upon his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lucentio and hortensio raised the wager to a hundred crowns and lucentio first sent his servant to desire bianca would come to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the servant returned and said sir my mistress sends you word she is busy and cannot come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how said petruchio does she say she is busy and cannot come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is that an answer for a wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they laughed at him and said it would be well if katharine did not send him a worse answer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now it was hortensios turn to send for his wife and he said to his servant go and entreat my wife to come to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay then she needs must come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid sir said hortensio your wife will not be entreated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but presently this civil husband looked a little blank when the servant returned without his mistress and he said to him how now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sir said the servant my mistress says you have some goodly jest in hand and therefore she will not come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she bids you come to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said petruchio and then he sent his servant saying sirrah go to your mistress and tell her i command her to come to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the company had scarcely time to think she would not obey this summons when baptista all in amaze exclaimed now by my holidame here comes katharine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she entered saying meekly to petruchio what is your will sir that you send for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where is your sister and hortensios wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katharine replied they sit conferring by the parlour fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> away went katharine without reply to perform her husbands command <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here is a wonder said lucentio if you talk of a wonder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it is said hortensio i marvel what it bodes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> marry peace it bodes said petruchio and love and quiet life and right supremacy and to be short everything that is sweet and happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katharines father overjoyed to see this reformation in his daughter said now fair befall thee son petruchio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have won the wager and i will add another twenty thousand crowns to her dowry as if she were another daughter for she is changed as if she had never been nay said petruchio i will win the wager better yet and show more signs of her newbuilt virtue and obedience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katharine now entering with the two ladies he continued see where she comes and brings your froward wives as prisoners to her womanly persuasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katharine that cap of yours does not become you off with that bauble and throw it under foot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katharine instantly took off her cap and threw it down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said hortensios wife may i never have a cause to sigh till i am brought to such a silly pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and bianca she too said fie what foolish duty call you this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on this biancas husband said to her i wish your duty were as foolish too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wisdom of your duty fair bianca has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the more fool you said bianca for laying on my duty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> katharine said petruchio i charge you tell these headstrong women what duty they owe their lords and husbands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to the wonder of all present the reformed shrewish lady spoke as eloquently in praise of the wifelike duty of obedience as she had practiced it implicitly in a ready submission to petruchios will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and katharine once more became famous in padua not as heretofore as katharine the shrew but as katharine the most obedient and duteous wife in padua <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the states of syracuse and ephesus being at variance there was a cruel law made at ephesus ordaining that if any merchant of syracuse was seen in the city of ephesus he was to be put to death unless he could pay a thousand marks for the ransom of his life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aegeon an old merchant of syracuse was discovered in the streets of ephesus and brought before the duke either to pay this heavy fine or to receive sentence of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aegeon had no money to pay the fine and the duke before he pronounced the sentence of death upon him desired him to relate the history of his life and to tell for what cause he had ventured to come to the city of ephesus which it was death for any syracusan merchant to enter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aegeon said that he did not fear to die for sorrow had made him weary of his life but that a heavier task could not have been imposed upon him than to relate the events of his unfortunate life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then i was born at syracuse and brought up to the profession of a merchant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i married a lady with whom i lived very happily but being obliged to go to epidamnum i was detained there by my business six months and then finding i should be obliged to stay some time longer i sent for my wife who as soon as she arrived was brought to bed of two sons and what was very strange they were both so exactly alike that it was impossible to distinguish the one from the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time that my wife was brought to bed of these twin boys a poor woman in the inn where my wife lodged was brought to bed of two sons and these twins were as much like each other as my two sons were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the parents of these children being exceeding poor i bought the two boys and brought them up to attend upon my sons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my sons were very fine children and my wife was not a little proud of two such boys and she daily wishing to return home i unwillingly agreed and in an evil hour we got on shipboard for we had not sailed above a league from epidamnum before a dreadful storm arose which continued with such violence that the sailors seeing no chance of saving the ship crowded into the boat to save their own lives leaving us alone in the ship which we every moment expected would be destroyed by the fury of the storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the incessant weeping of my wife and the piteous complaints of the pretty babes who not knowing what to fear wept for fashion because they saw their mother weep filled me with terror for them though i did not for myself fear death and all my thoughts were bent to contrive means for their safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tied my youngest son to the end of a small spare mast such as seafaring men provide against storms at the other end i bound the youngest of the twin slaves and at the same time i directed my wife how to fasten the other children in like manner to another mast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she thus having the care of the two eldest children and i of the two younger we bound ourselves separately to these masts with the children and but for this contrivance we had all been lost for the ship split on a mighty rock and was dashed in pieces and we clinging to these slender masts were supported above the water where i having the care of two children was unable to assist my wife who with the other children was soon separated from me but while they were yet in my sight they were taken up by a boat of fishermen from corinth as i supposed and seeing them in safety i had no care but to struggle with the wild seawaves to preserve my dear son and the youngest slave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length we in our turn were taken up by a ship and the sailors knowing me gave us kind welcome and assistance and landed us in safety at syracuse but from that sad hour i have never known what became of my wife and eldest child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my youngest son and now my only care when he was eighteen years of age began to be inquisitive after his mother and his brother and often importuned me that he might take his attendant the young slave who had also lost his brother and go in search of them at length i unwillingly gave consent for though i anxiously desired to hear tidings of my wife and eldest son yet in sending my younger one to find them i hazarded the loss of them also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is now seven years since my son left me five years have i passed in travelling through the world in search of him i have been in farthest greece and through the bounds of asia and coasting homewards i landed here in ephesus being unwilling to leave any place unsought that harbours men but this day must end the story of my life and happy should i think myself in my death if i were assured my wife and sons were here the hapless aegeon ended the account of his misfortunes and the duke pitying this unfortunate father who had brought upon himself this great peril by his love for his lost son said if it were not against the laws which his oath and dignity did not permit him to alter he would freely pardon him yet instead of dooming him to instant death as the strict letter of the law required he would give him that day to try if he could beg or borrow the money to pay the fine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this day of grace did seem no great favour to aegeon for not knowing any man in ephesus there seemed to him but little chance that any stranger would lend or give him a thousand marks to pay the fine and helpless and hopeless of any relief he retired from the presence of the duke in the custody of a jailor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aegeon supposed he knew no person in ephesus but at the very time he was in danger of losing his life through the careful search he was making after his youngest son that son and his eldest son also were both in the city of ephesus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aegeons sons besides being exactly alike in face and person were both named alike being both called antipholus and the two twin slaves were also both named dromio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> aegeons youngest son antipholus of syracuse he whom the old man had come to ephesus to seek happened to arrive at ephesus with his slave dromio that very same day that aegeon did and he being also a merchant of syracuse he would have been in the same danger that his father was but by good fortune he met a friend who told him the peril an old merchant of syracuse was in and advised him to pass for a merchant of epidamnum this antipholus agreed to do and he was sorry to hear one of his own countrymen was in this danger but he little thought this old merchant was his own father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eldest son of aegeon who must be called antipholus of ephesus to distinguish him from his brother antipholus of syracuse had lived at ephesus twenty years and being a rich man was well able to have paid the money for the ransom of his fathers life but antipholus knew nothing of his father being so young when he was taken out of the sea with his mother by the fishermen that he only remembered he had been so preserved but he had no recollection of either his father or his mother the fishermen who took up this antipholus and his mother and the young slave dromio having carried the two children away from her to the great grief of that unhappy lady intending to sell them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antipholus and dromio were sold by them to duke menaphon a famous warrior who was uncle to the duke of ephesus and he carried the boys to ephesus when he went to visit the duke his nephew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the duke of ephesus taking a liking to young antipholus when he grew up made him an officer in his army in which he distinguished himself by his great bravery in the wars where he saved the life of his patron the duke who rewarded his merit by marrying him to adriana a rich lady of ephesus with whom he was living his slave dromio still attending him at the time his father came there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antipholus of syracuse when he parted with his friend who advised him to say he came from epidamnum gave his slave dromio some money to carry to the inn where he intended to dine and in the mean time he said he would walk about and view the city and observe the manners of the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dromio was a pleasant fellow and when antipholus was dull and melancholy he used to divert himself with the odd humours and merry jests of his slave so that the freedoms of speech he allowed in dromio were greater than is usual between masters and their servants <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when antipholus of syracuse had sent dromio away he stood awhile thinking over his solitary wanderings in search of his mother and his brother of whom in no place where he landed could he hear the least tidings and he said sorrowfully to himself i am like a drop of water in the ocean which seeking to find its fellow drop loses itself in the wide sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i unhappily to find a mother and a brother do lose while he was thus meditating on his weary travels which had hitherto been so useless dromio as he thought returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antipholus wondering that he came back so soon asked him where he had left the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now it was not his own dromio but the twinbrother that lived with antipholus of ephesus that he spoke to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two dromios and the two antipholuses were still as much alike as aegeon had said they were in their infancy therefore no wonder antipholus thought it was his own slave returned and asked him why he came back so soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dromio replied my mistress sent me to bid you come to dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the capon burns and the pig falls from the spit and the meat will be all cold if you do not come home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these jests are out of season said antipholus where did you leave the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dromio still answering that his mistress had sent him to fetch antipholus to dinner what mistress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why your worships wife sir replied dromio <end> <end> 
<start> <start> antipholus having no wife he was very angry with dromio and said because i familiarly sometimes chat with you you presume to jest with me in this free manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am not in a sportive humour now where is the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we being strangers here how dare you trust so great a charge from your own custody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dromio hearing his master as he thought him talk of their being strangers supposing antipholus was jesting replied merrily i pray you sir jest as you sit at dinner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had no charge but to fetch you home to dine with my mistress and her sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now antipholus lost all patience and beat dromio who ran home and told his mistress that his master had refused to come to dinner and said that he had no wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never would he forget that street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a broad street lined on both sides with just such tall whitestone buildings dotted with dark windows they stretched along as far as the eye could see flooded with a bright moonlight that gave them a calcium pallor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he imagined each one to have an elevator and a colored hallboy and a keyrack each one to be eight stories high and full of three and four room suites <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was rather glad to walk into the cheeriness of phoebes livingroom and sink onto a sofa while the girls went rummaging for food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phoebes great stuff confided sloane sotto voce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im only going to stay half an hour amory said sternly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wondered if it sounded priggish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont like this place amory said sulkily and i dont want any food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> phoebe reappeared with sandwiches brandy bottle siphon and four glasses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amory pour em out she said and well drink to fred sloane who has a rare distinguished edge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said axia coming in and amory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat down beside him and laid her yellow head on his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill pour said sloane you use siphon phoebe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they filled the tray with glasses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a minute while temptation crept over him like a warm wind and his imagination turned to fire and he took the glass from phoebes hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was all for at the second that his decision came he looked up and saw ten yards from him the man who had been in the cafi and with his jump of astonishment the glass fell from his uplifted hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there the man half sat half leaned against a pile of pillows on the corner divan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was cast in the same yellow wax as in the cafi neither the dull pasty color of a dead manrather a sort of virile pallornor unhealthy youd have called it but like a strong man whod worked in a mine or done night shifts in a damp climate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amory looked him over carefully and later he could have drawn him after a fashion down to the merest details <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mouth was the kind that is called frank and he had steady gray eyes that moved slowly from one to the other of their group with just the shade of a questioning expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amory noticed his hands they werent fine at all but they had versatility and a tenuous strength  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were nervous hands that sat lightly along the cushions and moved constantly with little jerky openings and closings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then suddenly amory perceived the feet and with a rush of blood to the head he realized he was afraid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the feet were all wrong  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a sort of wrongness that he felt rather than knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like weakness in a good woman or blood on satin one of those terrible incongruities that shake little things in the back of the brain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wore no shoes but instead a sort of half moccasin pointed though like the shoes they wore in the fourteenth century and with the little ends curling up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were a darkish brown and his toes seemed to fill them to the end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must have said something or looked something for axias voice came out of the void with a strange goodness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor old amorys sickold head going round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried amory pointing toward the corner divan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amorys got a purple zebra watching him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the human voices fell faintly on his ear thought you werent drinking remarked axia sardonically but her voice was good to hear the whole divan that held the man was alive alive like heat waves over asphalt like wriggling worms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amory dear you arent going amory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was halfway to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on amory stick th us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the elevator was close and the colored boy was half asleep paled to a livid bronze  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> axias beseeching voice floated down the shaft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as they settled to the lower floor the feet came into view in the down the long street came the moon and amory turned his back on it and walked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten fifteen steps away sounded the footsteps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were like a slow dripping with just the slightest insistence in their fall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amorys shadow lay perhaps ten feet ahead of him and soft shoes was presumably that far behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the instinct of a child amory edged in under the blue darkness of the white buildings cleaving the moonlight for haggard seconds once bursting into a slow run with clumsy stumblings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that he stopped suddenly he must keep hold he thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his lips were dry and he licked them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he met any one goodwere there any good people left in the world or did they all live in white apartmenthouses now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was every one followed in the moonlight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if he met some one good whod know what he meant and hear this damned scuffle  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the scuffling grew suddenly nearer and a black cloud settled over the moon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when again the pale sheen skimmed the cornices it was almost beside him and amory thought he heard a quiet breathing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly he realized that the footsteps were not behind had never been behind they were ahead and he was not eluding but following  <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to run blindly his heart knocking heavily his hands clinched <end> <end> 
<start> <start> far ahead a black dot showed itself resolved slowly into a human shape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but amory was beyond that now he turned off the street and darted into an alley narrow and dark and smelling of old rottenness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he twisted down a long sinuous blackness where the moonlight was shut away except for tiny glints and patches  <end> <end>
