<start> <start> most reprehensible most reprehensible exclaimed professor porter with a faint trace of irritation in his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander never before in my life have i known one of these animals to be permitted to roam at large from its cage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall most certainly report this outrageous breach of ethics to the directors of the adjacent zoological garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander and the sooner it is done the better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander set off in the direction that would put the greatest distance between themselves and the lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had proceeded but a short distance when a backward glance revealed to the horrified gaze of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tightened his grip upon the protesting professor and increased his speed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lion also had quickened his gait and was doggedly maintaining an unvarying distance behind them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander remonstrated the professor this unseemly haste is most unbecoming to men of letters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what will our friends think of us who may chance to be upon the street and witness our frivolous antics <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lion was bounding along in easy leaps scarce five paces behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander dropped the professors arm and broke into a mad orgy of speed that would have done credit to any varsity track team <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander screamed professor porter as metaphorically speaking he himself threw her into high <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he too had caught a fleeting backward glimpse of cruel yellow eyes and half open mouth within startling proximity of his person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with streaming coat tails and shiny silk hat professor archimedes q <end> <end> 
<start> <start> porter fled through the moonlight close upon the heels of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before them a point of the jungle ran out toward a narrow promontory and it was for the heaven of the trees he saw there that mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander directed his prodigious leaps and bounds while from the shadows of this same spot peered two keen eyes in interested appreciation of the race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was tarzan of the apes who watched with face agrin this odd game of followtheleader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew the two men were safe enough from attack in so far as the lion was concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very fact that numa had foregone such easy prey at all convinced the wise forest craft of tarzan that numas belly already was full <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lion might stalk them until hungry again but the chances were that if not angered he would soon tire of the sport and slink away to his jungle lair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really the one great danger was that one of the men might stumble and fall and then the yellow devil would be upon him in a moment and the joy of the kill would be too great a temptation to withstand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so tarzan swung quickly to a lower limb in line with the approaching fugitives and as mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander came panting and blowing beneath him already too spent to struggle up to the safety of the limb tarzan reached down and grasping him by the collar of his coat yanked him to the limb by his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another moment brought the professor within the sphere of the friendly grip and he too was drawn upward to safety just as the baffled numa with a roar leaped to recover his vanishing quarry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment the two men clung panting to the great branch while tarzan squatted with his back to the stem of the tree watching them with mingled curiosity and amusement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the professor who first broke the silence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander that you should have evinced such a paucity of manly courage in the presence of one of the lower orders and by your crass timidity have caused me to exert myself to such an unaccustomed degree in order that i might resume my discourse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander when you interrupted me the moors professor archimedes q <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander in icy tones the time has arrived when patience becomes a crime and mayhem appears garbed in the mantle of virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have insinuated that you ran only to overtake me not to escape the clutches of the lion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> goaded by longsuffering patience the worm will turn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i forget nothing as yet professor archimedes q <end> <end> 
<start> <start> porter but believe me sir i am tottering on the verge of forgetfulness as to your exalted position in the world of science and your gray hairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the professor sat in silence for a few minutes and the darkness hid the grim smile that wreathed his wrinkled countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look here skinny philander he said in belligerent tones if you are lookin for a scrap peel off your coat and come on down on the ground and ill punch your head just as i did sixty years ago in the alley back of porky evans barn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when youre human ark i love you but somehow it seems as though you had forgotten how to be human for the last twenty years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the professor reached out a thin trembling old hand through the darkness until it found his old friends shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it hasnt been quite twenty years and god alone knows how hard i have tried to be human for janes sake and yours too since he took my other jane away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philanders side to clasp the one that lay upon his shoulder and no other message could better have translated the one heart to the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lion below them paced nervously back and forth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the third figure in the tree was hidden by the dense shadows near the stem <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he too was silentmotionless as a graven image <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you certainly pulled me up into this tree just in time said the professor at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i didnt pull you up here professor said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the excitement of the moment quite caused me to forget that i myself was drawn up here by some outside agencythere must be someone or something in this tree with us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander and he added i think we should thank the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he may be sitting right next to you now professor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said professor porter edging cautiously nearer to mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then it occurred to tarzan of the apes that numa had loitered beneath the tree for a sufficient length of time so he raised his young head toward the heavens and there rang out upon the terrified ears of the two old men the awful warning challenge of the anthropoid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two friends huddled trembling in their precarious position on the limb saw the great lion halt in his restless pacing as the bloodcurdling cry smote his ears and then slink quickly into the jungle to be instantly lost to view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the lion trembles in fear whispered mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most remarkable most remarkable murmured professor porter clutching frantically at mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philander to regain the balance which the sudden fright had so perilously endangered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> philanders center of equilibrium was at that very moment hanging upon the ragged edge of nothing so that it needed but the gentle impetus supplied by the additional weight of professor porters body to topple the devoted secretary from the limb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment they swayed uncertainly and then with mingled and most unscholarly shrieks they pitched headlong from the tree locked in frenzied embrace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was quite some moments ere either moved for both were positive that any such attempt would reveal so many breaks and fractures as to make further progress impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length professor porter made an attempt to move one leg <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to his surprise it responded to his will as in days gone by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he now drew up its mate and stretched it forth again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> villikins barked and sniffed and howled in impatience and after many vain attempts succeeded in dragging off the prize though he singed his nose in doing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dinah meanwhile watched him placidly her delicate nostrils quivering with expectation and after all excitement had subsided walked with dignity to the table her beautiful gray satin tail sweeping behind her and calmly putting up one velvet paw drew the sausage gently down and walked out of the room without turning a hair so to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elfrida had scattered handfuls of seeds over the snow in the garden that the wild birds might have a comfortable breakfast next morning and had stuffed bundles of dried grasses in the fireplaces so that the reindeer of santa claus could refresh themselves after their long gallops across country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was really only done for fun but it pleased carol <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when after dinner the whole family had gone to church to see the christmas decorations carol limped wearily out on her little crutches and with elfridas help placed all the family boots in a row in the upper hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was to keep the dear ones from quarreling all through the year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were papas stout top boots mamas pretty buttoned shoes next then uncle jacks donalds pauls and hughs and at the end of the line her own little white worsted slippers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow called all the children together before letting them go off to play and told them at what time the start for home would be made so that they would not be late in coming back to the meeting place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he said have the best fun you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> play anything you wish school games if you like but dont get too warm or excited <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may eat your luncheon when you like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so nan and bert decided that the little ones might at least have a sandwich and a piece of cake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nor did they forget the two little jones children who had no lunch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bobbseys were well provided and soon sammie and julia were smiling and happy as they sat beneath a tree eating <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then came all sorts of games from tag and jumping rope to blindmans bluff and hideandseek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> snap was made to do a number of tricks much to the amusement of the teachers and children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> danny rugg and some of the older boys got up a small baseball game and then danny with one or two chums went off in a deeper part of the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert heard one of the boys ask another if he had any matches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know what theyre going to do whispered bert to nan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan was much shocked but she did not see anything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bert went off with some boys to see if they could catch any fish in the deeper part of the brook about half a mile from the picnic grove and nan with one or two girls about her own age took a little walk with flossie and freddie to gather some late wild flowers that grew on the side of one of the hills <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they found a number of the blossoms and were making pretty bouquets of them when freddie who had gone on a little ahead of the rest came running back so fast that he nearly rolled to the bottom of the hill so fat and chubby was he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked nan catching her brother just in time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got a book about snakes and hell know what to do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fright the children turned freddie looking back at the spot where he thought he had seen the snake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter xi nan bobbsey stood for a moment she hardly knew why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps she wanted to see the big snake of which freddie spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it certainly was not because she liked reptiles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she thought she saw something long and black wiggling toward her and with a little exclamation of fright she too turned to follow the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as she did so she saw their dog snap come running up the hill barking and wagging his tail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seemed to have lost the children for a moment and to be telling them how glad he was that he had found them again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> straight up the hill toward where freddie had said the snake was rushed snap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no dont let him he may be bitten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but snap evidently did not want to mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on up the hill he rushed pausing now and then to dig in the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nearer and nearer he came to where the little bobbsey boy had said the snake was hiding in the grass and bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flossie and freddie were sitting on an old stump when two rabbits ran right across the road in front of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freddie ran after them as far as he could go in the brushwood but of course no one can go as fast as a rabbit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think the squirrels are the prettiest things that live in the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have tails just like mammas feather boa and they walk sitting up so cute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i think the rabbits are the nicest lisped freddie cause they are bunnies and bunnies bring easter eggs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we have made the loveliest fern garden up back of the swing said flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we got a whole basket of ferns in the woods and transplanted them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the center we have some lovely jackin thepulpits nan added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some are light green striped and the largest are purple with gold stripes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jacks stand up straight just like real live boys preaching in a pulpit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think mamma asked flossie that daisies and violets make a lovely garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a round place in the middle of our wild flower bed just full of light blue violets and white daisies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all flowers are beautiful their mamma told them but i do think with flossie that daisies and violets are very sweet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and mamma we got a big piece of the loveliest green moss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is just like real velvet said flossie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we found a place all covered with it down by the pond under the dark cedar trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan said it wouldnt grow in our garden but i brought some home to try <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put it in a cool dark place and im going to put lots of water on it every day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moss must be very cool and damp to grow mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember how disappointed i used to be when i was a little girl and tried to make it grow around my geraniums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would always dry up and turn brown in a few days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh called freddie from his garden under the cherry tree come quick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan and flossie hurried to where their little brother had dug a hole in the earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while flossie ran to tell bert nan watched the tiny mice so that they would not get away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a nest of field mice harry told them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well put them in a cage and have them in our circus <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theyre my mice cried freddie and i wont let anybody have them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were only going to help you take care of them in a little box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh theres the mother catch her harry called bert <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mother mouse was not so easy to catch however and the boys had quite a chase after her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last she ran into a tin box the boys had sunk in the ground when playing golf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive got a queer kind of a trap harry said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can put them in this until we build a larger one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can make one out of a box with a wire door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the mice were the smallest cutest things not larger than freddies thumb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hardly looked like mice at all but like some queer little bugs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were put in the cage trap mother and all and then bert got them a bit of cheese from the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you go bringing dem mice in de house to eat all our cake and pie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you just better drown dem in de brook before dey bring a whole lot more mices around here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well keep them away from the house bert told dinah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to have a circus you know and these will be our trained mice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freddie of course was delighted with the little things and wanted to dig for more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we might catch butterflies and have them under a big glass on the table with all the small animals that would be good harry agreed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we could catch some big brown ones and some little fancy ones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then after dark we could get some big moths down by the postoffice electric light <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nan was able to secure four or five yellow ones in the flower garden near the porch and flossie got two of the small brown variety in the nasturtium bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> harry and bert searched in the close syringa bushes where the nests are usually found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> called freddie coming up with a great green butterfly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it really was very large and had such beautiful wings it might easily be mistaken for some strange bird <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did he do so because the hand kept one of the bulbs of the great black tulip or because this hand was rosas <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall leave rosa withdrew with the other two suckers pressing them to did she press them to her heart because they were the bulbs of the great black tulip or because she had them from this point we believe might be more readily decided than however that may have been from that moment life became rosa as we have seen had returned to him one of the every evening she brought to him handful by handful a quantity of soil from that part of the garden which he had a large jug which cornelius had skilfully broken did service as a flowerpot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he half filled it and mixed the earth of the garden with a small portion of dried river mud then at the beginning of april he planted his first sucker not a day passed on which rosa did not come to have her chat the tulips concerning whose cultivation rosa was taught all the mysteries of the art formed the principal topic of the conversation but interesting as the subject was people they therefore began to chat also about other things and the tulipfancier found out to his great astonishment what a only rosa had made it a habit to keep her pretty face invariably six inches distant from the grating having there was one thing especially which gave cornelius almost as much anxiety as his bulbs a subject to which he always indeed van baerles happiness depended on the whim of this man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might one day find loewestein dull or the air of the place unhealthy or the gin bad and leave the fortress and take his daughter with him when cornelius and rosa of what use would the carrier pigeons then be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said cornelius to rosa as you my dear girl would not be able to read what i should write to you nor to write to me your well answered rosa who in her heart was as much afraid of a separation as cornelius himself we have one hour let us employ it even better said rosa smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall make the best of your lessons believe me and in this way we shall never be separated will you remain for ever in prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said and after having granted you your life will not his highness also grant you your liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and will you not then recover your fortune and be a rich man and then when you are driving in your own coach riding your own horse will you still look at poor rosa the daughter of a jailer scarcely better cornelius tried to contradict her and certainly he would have done so with all his heart and with all the sincerity she however smilingly interrupted him saying how is to speak to cornelius of his tulip was an expedient resorted very well indeed he said the coat is growing black the sprouting has commenced the veins of the bulb are swelling in eight days hence and perhaps sooner we may distinguish the first buds of the leaves protruding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and oh i have done things on a large scale and according to now let me hear rosa what you have done said cornelius with as tender an anxiety as he had lately shown well she said smiling for in her own heart she could not help studying this double love of the prisoner for herself and for the black tulip i have done things on a large scale i have prepared a bed as you described it to me on a clear spot far from trees and walls in a soil slightly mixed with sand rather moist than dry without a i am now only waiting for your further orders to put in the bulb you know that i must be behindhand with you as i have in my favour all the chances of good air of the sun and all true all true exclaimed cornelius clapping his hands with joy you are a good pupil rosa and you are dont forget said rosa smiling that your pupil as you call me has still other things to learn besides the yes yes and i am as anxious as you are rosa that you oh said rosa i have a book a book which i hope will on the following evening rosa returned with the bible of on the following evening as we have said rosa returned then began between the master and the pupil one of those charming scenes which are the delight of the novelist who the grated window the only opening through which the two lovers were able to communicate was too high for conveniently reading a book although it had been quite rosa therefore had to press the open book against the grating edgewise holding above it in her right hand the lamp but cornelius hit upon the lucky idea of fixing it to the bars so as to afford her a little rest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she listened with her face towards him all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it trotty withdrew resumed his seat by the fire and once more if the towerdoor is really open said toby hastily laying aside his apron but never thinking of his hat whats to hinder me from going up into the steeple and satisfying myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if its shut i dont want any other satisfaction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was pretty certain as he slipped out quietly into the street that he should find it shut and locked for he knew the door well and had so rarely seen it open that he couldnt reckon above three times in all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a low arched portal outside the church in a dark nook behind a column and had such great iron hinges and such but what was his astonishment when coming bareheaded to the church and putting his hand into this dark nook with a certain misgiving that it might be unexpectedly seized and a shivering propensity to draw it back again he found that the door which he thought on the first surprise of going back or of getting a light or a companion but his courage aided him immediately and what have i to fear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides the ringers may be there and have forgotten to shut the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he went in feeling his way as he went like a blind man for it was the dust from the street had blown into the recess and lying there heaped up made it so soft and velvetlike to the foot that there was something startling even in that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the narrow stair was so close to the door too that he stumbled at the very first and shutting the door upon himself by striking it with his foot and this was another reason however for going on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> up up up and round and round and up up it was a disagreeable staircase for that groping work so low and narrow that his groping hand was always touching something and it often felt so like a man or ghostly figure standing up erect and making room for him to pass without discovery that he would rub the smooth wall upward searching for its face and downward searching for its feet while a chill tingling crept all over him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> h would not go to a play for the world he thinks i as ignorant and unpolished as he is do you know miss jenny that i propose to introduce him to th why my lovely girl that you may take him unde your protection as madame ramboulliet did youn stanhope that you may by your plastic hand moul this uncouth cub into a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is to mak yes mistress jenny make love to you and i doub not when he shall become domesticated in your kitchen that this boor under your auspices will soon becom i must say mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jessamy if he copies after me h stay here one moment and i will call him.jona than!mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are not fooled by each dorn apparently had not heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> selma saw that to speak would be to interrupt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat at her own table and set to work on the editorial paragraphs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after perhaps an hour she happened to glance at victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was leaning back in his chair gazing past her out into the open in his face was an expression she had never seena look in the eyes a relaxing of the muscles round the mouth that made her think of him as a man instead of as a leader <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a fascinating man he she felt that he was not thinking of his work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she longed to talk to him but she did not venture to interrupt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never in all the years she had known him had he spoken to heror to any onea severe or even an impatient word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yetshe and all who came into contact with him were afraid of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there could come and on occasion there did comeinto those extraordinary blue eyes an expression beside which the fiercest flash of wrath would be easy to face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she glanced at him again his normal expression had returnedthe face of the leader who aroused in those he converted into fellowworkers a fanatical devotion that was the more formidable because it was not infatuated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he caught her eye things are in such good shape for us that it frightens me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i spend most of my time in studying the horizon in the hope that i can foresee which way the storms coming from and what it will what a pessimist you are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why the workingmens league has a thick andthin membership of thirteen hundred and fifty replied victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why the new day has twenty two hundred paying subscribers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats why we grow faster than the employers can weed our men out and replace them with immigrants and force them well anyhow said the girl no matter what happens we victor shook his head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our danger period has just begun he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the past weve been annoyed a little from time to time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they thought us hardly i hope they will prosecute us said selma <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then well not if they do it intelligently replied victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an intelligent persecutionif its relentless enough always succeeds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you forget that this isnt a world of moral ideas but of force <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is something more than a vulgar boss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my hope is that he wont be able to make the others see <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was extremely polite to memore so than he ever has been before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suspect that he thinks he has us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we shall have to begin how stupid they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to fight us who are simply trying to bring about peaceably and sensibly whats yesthe rain is bound to come said victor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we say heres an umbrella and theres the way to shelter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they laugh at our umbrella and with the first drops plashing on their the workingmens league always first in the field with its ticket had been unusually early that year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although it was only the first week in august and the election would not be until the third of october the league had nominated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a ticket made up entirely of skilled workers who had lived all their lives in remsen city and who had acquired an independence victor dorn was careful not to expose to the falling fire of the opposition any of his men who could be ruined by the loss of a job or could be compelled to leave town in search of work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the league always went early into campaign because it pursued a much slower and less expensive method of electioneering than either of the old partiesor than any of the upper class reform parties that sprang up from time to time and died away as they accomplished or failed of their purposesecuring recognition for certain personal ambitions not agreeable to the old established bosses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides the league was like the bosses and their henchmen in politics every day in every year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the league theory was that politics was as much a part of a citizens daily routine as his other work or his meals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the night of the leagues great ratification meeting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day the first campaign number containing the biographical sketch of tony rivers kellys righthand man would go upon the press and on the following day it would reach the public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> market square in remsen city was on the edge of the power quarter was surrounded by cheap hotels boarding houses and saloons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few years before the most notable citizens market basket on arm could have been seen three mornings in the week making the rounds of the stalls and stands both those in the open and those within the market house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but customs had rapidly changed in remsen city and with the exception of a few old fogies only the poorer classes went to market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the masters of houses were becoming gentlemen and the housewives were elevating into ladiesand it goes without saying that no gentleman and no lady would descend to a menial task even in private much less in public <end> <end> 
<start> <start> market square had even become too common for any but the inferior meetings of the two leading political parties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only the workingmens league held to the old tradition that a political meeting of the first rank could be properly held nowhere but in the natural assembling place of the peopletheir market <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so their first great rally of the campaign was billed for market square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at eight oclock headed by a large and vigorous drum corps the victor dorn cohorts at their full strength marched into the centre of the square where one of the stands had been transformed with flags bunting and torches into a speakers platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a crowd of many thousands accompanied and followed the procession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> workingmens league meetings were popular even among those who believed their interests lay elsewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at league meetings one heard the plain truth sometimes extremely startling plain truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the league had no favors to ask of anybody had nothing to conceal was strongly opposed to any and all political concealments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus its speakers enjoyed a freedom not usual in political speakingand dorn and his fellowleaders were careful that no router no exaggerator or well intentioned wild man of any kind should open his mouth under a league banner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was what made the league so dangerousand so steadily prosperous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the chairman thomas colman the cooper was opening the meeting in a speech which was an instance of how well a man of no platform talent can acquit himself when he believes something and believes it is his duty to convey it to his fellowmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor dorn to be the fourth speaker and the orator of the evening was standing at the rear of the platform partially concealed by the crowd of men and women leaders of the party grouped behind colman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as always at the big formal demonstrations of the league victor was watching every move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this evening his anxiety was deeper than ever before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his trained political sagacity warned him that as he had suggested to selma the time of his partys first great crisis was at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no movement could become formidable with out a life and death struggle when its aim frankly was to snatch power from the dominant class and to place it where that class could not hope to prevail either by direct means of force or by its favorite indirect means of bribery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what would be his stroke at the very life of the league <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for victor had measured kelly and knew he was not one to strike until he could destroy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like every competent man of action victor had measured his own abilities and had found that they were to be relied upon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the contest between him and kelly the contest in the last ditchwas so appallingly unequal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kelly had the courts and the police the moneyed class the employers of labor had the clergy and welldressed respectability the newspapers all the customary arbiters of public sentiment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he had the criminal and the semicriminal classes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the letter of the law guaranteeing freedom of innocent speech and action guaranteeing the purity of the ballotno not guaranteeing but simply asserting those rights and leaving the upholding of them tokellys allies and henchmen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also the league had the power of between a thousand and fifteen hundred intelligent and devoted men and about the same number of womena solid phalanx of great might of might far beyond its numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had no mean opinion of his value to the movement but he far and most modestly underestimated it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the human way of rallying to an abstract principle is by way of a standard bearera man personalitya real or fancied incarnation of the ideal to be struggled for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and to the workingmens league to the movement for conquering remsen city for the mass of its citizens victor dorn was that incarnation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> kelly could use violenceviolence disguised as law violence candidly and brutally lawless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor dorn could only use lawful meansclearly and cautiously lawful means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must at all costs prevent the use of force against him and his partymust give kelly no pretext for using the law lawlessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if kelly used force against him whether the perverted law of the courts or open lawlessness he must meet it with peace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if kelly smote him on the right cheek he must give him the left to be smitten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the league could outvote kelly thenanother policy still of calmness and peace and civilization but not so meek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but until the league could outvote kelly nothing but patient endurance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every man in the league had been drilled in this strategy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every man understoodand to be a member of the league meant that one was politically educated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor believed in his associates as he believed in himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if kelly should suddenly offer some adroit outrageous provocation would the league be able to resist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> victor on guard studied the crowd spreading out from the platform in a gigantic fan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing there to arouse suspicion ten or twelve thousand of working class men and women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his glance pushed on out toward the edges of the crowdtoward the saloons and alleys of the disreputable south side of market square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his glance traveled slowly along pausing upon each place where these loungers too far away to hear were gathered into larger groups <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why he did not know but suddenly his glance wheeled to the right and then as suddenly to the leftthe west and the east ends of the square <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dropped into a chair before the open fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he slowly lighted a cigar and began to smoke it his attitude one of waiting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been thinking she began at lastshe was looking reflectively into the fireabout your great talent for business and finance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you formed your big combination and because you understand everything about wool you employ more men you pay higher wages and you make the goods better than ever and at less cost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between a third and a half cheaper he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we employ thirty thousand more men and since we settled the last strikea grim smile that would have meant a great deal to her had she known the history of that strike and how hard he had fought before he gave inweve paid thirty per cent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youve made millions for yourself and for those in with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when a doctor or a man of science or a philosopher makes a discovery thatll be a benefit to the worldshe looked at him suddenly earnest appealinghe gives it freely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he smiled into the firehardly a day passed that he did not have presented to him some scheme for relieving him of the burden of his riches here was another and from such an unexpected quarter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we spend twenty fifty times as much as we can possibly enjoy and you have more than we could possibly spend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why shouldnt a man with financial genius be like men with other kinds of genius <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should he be the only one to stay down on the level with dull moneygrubbing sordid kinds of people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed so earnest was she that she did not just think john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of giving out in these charities and philanthropiesi never did believe in themtheyre bound to be more or less degrading to the people that take and when its so hard to help a friend with money without harming him how much harder it must be to help strangers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of those things why not be really great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just think john how the world would honor you and how you would feel if you used your genius to make the necessaries cheap for all these fellowbeings of ours who have such a hard time getting on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that would be real superiorityand our life now is so vain so empty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked curious as always when a new idea was presented to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this was certainly newapparently philanthropy without expense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why not put your great combine on such a basis that it would bring an honest just return to you and the others and would pay the highest possible wages and would give the people the benefit of what your genius for manufacturing and for finance has made possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we who are so comfortable and never have to think of the necessaries of life forget how much a few cents here and there mean to most people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the things you control mean all the difference between warmth and cold between life and death john <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she talked he settled back into his chair and his face hardened into its unyielding expression <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not philanthropy without expense but philanthropy at the expense both of his fortune and of his position as a master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to use his brain and his life for those ungrateful people who derided his benefactions as either contributions to the conscience fund or as indirect attempts at public bribery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not conceal his impatiencethough he did not venture to put it into words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if weif you and i john she hurried on leaning toward him in her earnestness had something like that to live for it might come to be very different with usandim thinking of gardiner most of all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one no one can lead this kind of life without being dragged down without becoming selfish and sordid and cruel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont understand he said curtly without looking at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she winced and was silent sat watching his bold strong profile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she said in a changed strange strained voice what i asked to see you for wasjohn wont you put the pricesat least where they were at the beginning of this dreadful winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youve been listening to the lies about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> reading she said her eyes flashing at the insult in the accusation that she had let people attack him to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well reading then he went on wondering what he had said that angered her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he made an elaborate explanationabout the necessity of meeting fixed charges which he himself had fixed about fair share of prosperity everything more expensive the country better able to pay every one doing as we are and so on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she listened closely she had not come ignorant of the subject and she penetrated his sophistries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he saw her expression saw he had failed to convince her into his eyes came the look she understood wellthe look that told her she would only infuriate him and bruise herself by flinging herself against the iron of his resolve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must let me attend to my own business he ended his tone goodnatured his eyes hard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat staring into the fire for several minutesfrom her eyes looked a will as strong as his <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she rose and her voice lower than before but vibrating said all round ushere in new yorkall over this countryaway off in europei can see themi can feel themsuffering <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she drew herself up and faced him a light in her eyes before which he visibly shrank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it shant be mine or my boys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the morning she returned to dawn hill and arranged her affairs so that she would be free to go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not since the spring day nearly nine years before when she began that vergil lesson which ended in a lesson in the pitilessness of consequences that was not yet finished had her heart been so light so hopeful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in vain she reminded herself that the doing of this larger duty so imperative nevertheless endangered her father and mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they will be proud that im doing it she assured herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for gardiners sake as well as for mine theyll be glad i separated him and myself from this debased life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and already she felt the easing of the bonds that had never failed to cut deeper into the living flesh whenever she had ventured to hope that she was at last growing used to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she dared to exult but she did not dare to express to herself the hopes the wild incredible hopes which the very thought of freedom set to quivering deep down in her as the first warmth makes the life toss in its slumber in the planted seed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on friday she came up to new york late in the afternoon and in the evening went to the operafor a last look round <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the lights were lowering for the rise of the curtain on the second act leonora and her husband entered the box <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave leonora the chair in front and took the one behindmillicent rowland whom she herself brought had the other front seat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as her chair was midway between the two she was seeing across leonoras shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently dumont came in and took the chair behind leonoras and leaned forward his chin almost touching the slope of her neck as he talked to her in an undertone she greatly amused or pretending to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the light from the stage fell across leonoras bosom fell upon a magnificent string of graduated pearls clasped with a huge solitaire beyond question the string the jewelers clerk had blunderingly shown her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there was dumonts heavy coarse profile outlined against leonoras cheek and throat her cynical sensuous profile showing just beyond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> open sprang a hundred doors of memory into paulines mind was discharged avalanche after avalanche of dreadful thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her old friend was to the full as hearty and as glad as she and it really was if youll believe me quite a pleasant sight to see them embrace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know sometimes when you are used to a pretty face how when it comes into contact and comparison with another pretty face it seems for the moment to be homely and faded and hardly to deserve the high opinion you have had of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this was not at all the case either with dot or may for mays face set off dots and dots face set off mays so naturally and agreeably that as john peerybingle was very near saying when he came into the room they ought to have been born sisters which was the only improvement you could have suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton had brought his leg of mutton and wonderful to relate a tart besides but we dont mind a little dissipation when our brides are in the case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dont get married every day and in addition to these dainties there were the veal and hampie and things as mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peerybingle called them which were chiefly nuts and oranges and cakes and such small deer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the repast was set forth on the board flanked by calebs contribution which was a great wooden bowl of smoking potatoes he was prohibited by solemn compact from producing any other viands tackleton led his intended motherinlaw to the post of honour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the better gracing of this place at the high festival the majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> caleb sat next his daughter dot and her old schoolfellow were side by side the good carrier took care of the bottom of the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> miss slowboy was isolated for the time being from every article of furniture but the chair she sat on that she might have nothing else to knock the babys head against <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as tilly stared about her at the dolls and toys they stared at her and at the company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the venerable old gentlemen at the street doors who were all in full action showed especial interest in the party pausing occasionally before leaping as if they were listening to the conversation and then plunging wildly over and over a great many times without halting for breath as in a frantic state of delight with the whole proceedings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly if these old gentlemen were inclined to have a fiendish joy in the contemplation of tackletons discomfiture they had good reason to be satisfied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tackleton couldnt get on at all and the more cheerful his intended bride became in dots society the less he liked it though he had brought them together for that purpose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for he was a regular dog in the manger was tackleton and when they laughed and he couldnt he took it into his head immediately that they must be laughing at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to talk of those why you ant particularly old at any time are you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look at my sober plodding husband there returned dot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wrights house as i had a letter for that gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his answer was to grin at me incredulously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckoned you wahnt from these parts said he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nollichucky jacks been heah in jonesboro young ay sevier he repeated <end> <end>

<start> <start> he beant afeard of em and a bench warrant out agin him for high treason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never had sech a jamboree sence i kept the tavern <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they was in this here room most of the day and they was five fights before they and colonel tipton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh tipton said he he haint afeard neither but he and where is sevier now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wal said he shifting his tobacco from one sallow cheek to the other i reckon he and his boys rud out just afore you come in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mark me he added when i tell ye therell be trouble yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton and martin and the caroliny folks is burnin mad with chucky jack for the murder of corn tassel and other peaceful chiefs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but jack hez a wild lot with himsome of the nollichucky cave traders and theres one young lad that looks like he was a gentleman once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon jack himself wouldnt like to get into a fight with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> great goliah he exclaimed running to the door ef thar aint agoin to be another fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never seed sech i likewise ran to the door and this fight interested me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a great blackbearded mountaineerfarmer desperado in the midst of a circle pouring out a torrent of abuse at a tall young man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that thars hump gibson said the landlord genially pointing out the blackbearded ruffian and the young lawyer feller hez git a jedgment agin him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes got spunk but i reckon humpll tar the innards outn him yell git jedgment agin me ye caroliny splinter will ye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill pay bill wilder the skins when i git ready and all the pinhook youll pay bill wilder or go to jail by the eternal cried the young man quite as angrily whereupon i looked upon him with a mixture of admiration and commiseration with a gulping certainty in my throat that i was about to see murder done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a strange young man with the rare marked look that would compel even a poor memory to pick him out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for example he was very tall and very slim with red hair blown every which way over a high and towering forehead that seemed as long as the face under it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the face too was long and all freckled by the weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the blue eyes held me in wonder and these blazed with such prodigious wrath that if a look could have killed hump gibson would have been stricken on the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> skin out o here afore i kill ye he shouted and he charged at the slim young man like a buffalo while the crowd held its breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i who had looked upon cruel sights in my day was turning away with a kind of sickening when i saw the slim young man dodge the rush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with two strides of his long legs he reached the fence ripped off the topmost rail and his huge antagonist having changed his direction and coming at him with a bellow was met with the point of a scantling in the pit of his stomach and mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had all happened in a twinkling and there was a moments lull while the minds of the onlookers needed readjustment and then they gave vent to ecstasies of delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the landlord breathlessly he awestruck i looked at the tall young man and he was the very essence of wrath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unmindful of the plaudits he stood brandishing the fencerail over the great writhing figure on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i recall that this fact gave a twinge to something in my memory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on hump gibson he cried come on!at which the crowd went wild with pure joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thought ye was goin to eat im up hump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ye aint hed yer meal yet hump reminded another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hump gibson arose slowly out of the dust yet he did not stand straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried the young lawyerfellow and he thrust the point of the rail within a foot of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lacked the supreme test of courage which was demanded on this occasion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he turned and walked away very slowly as though his pace might mitigate in some degree the shame of his retreat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man flung away the fencerail and thrusting aside the overzealous among his admirers he strode past me into the tavern his anger still hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i remembered a slim wild sandyhaired boy digging his toes in the red mud long ago at the waxhaws settlement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i recalled with a smile my own fierce struggle at the schoolhouse with the same boy and how his slobbering had been my salvation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned and went in after him with the landlord who was rubbing his hands with glee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon hump wont come crowin round heah any more cot days mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson swept the room with his eyes and then glared at the landlord so that he gave back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a horse that could show heels to a light seemed to dawn on the landlords countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ay says the landlord hes been afightin with sevier all summer and i reckon he aint afeard of nothin any more than you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was going to bet me a sixforty he has at nashboro that his horse could beat mine on the greasy cove track <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the landlord apologetically nollichucky is he a man of honor or isnt he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord sir i only seen him once but id stake my oath on it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith a thoroughbred hoss says he sech nostrils and sech a gray eye with the devil in it fer goyellow they rud into town he lowered his voice for the room was filling snapped their fingers at tipton and his warrant and rud out agin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my god but that was like nollichucky jack <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson who had been divided between astonishment and impatience and anger burst out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what the devil do you mean by interfering with my business sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because it is my business too i answered quite as by jehovah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried jackson come outside sir the landlord backed away and the men in the tavern began to press around us expectantly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont let him git near no fences stranger said another <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson turned on this man with such truculence that he edged away to the rear of the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson starting for the door before i could reply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i followed perforce not without misgivings the crowd pushing eagerly after <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before we reached the dusty street jackson began pulling off his coat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a trice the shouting onlookers had made a ring and we stood facing each other he in his shirtsleeves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well fight fair said he his lips wetting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very good said i if you are still accustomed to this hasty manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have not asked my name my i know not whether it was what i said that made him stare or how i said it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no said i i am in a hurry to find mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the noise of the crowd was hushed and they drew nearer to hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson said i you are a lawyer and a gentleman and so am i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not care to be beaten to a pulp but i am not afraid of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will step back into the tavern i will explain to you mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the eternal said he you are a cool man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me my coat he shouted to the bystanders and they helped him on with it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now said he as they made to follow him keep back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the heavens he cried when he had gained the room i believe you are not afraid of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw it in your then i laughed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson said i doubtless you do not remember a homeless boy named david whom you took to your i do he exclaimed as i live i do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why we slept and you stumped your toe getting into bed and swore said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at that he laughed so heartily that the landlord came running across the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and we fought together at the old fields school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah i answered i come to that quickly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after i left your uncles house is he a charlestown temple <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for i spent some time gambling and horse racing with the gentry there and i know many of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was a wild lad i repeat his exact words and i ran up a bill in charlestown that would have filled a folio volume <end> <end> 
<start> <start> faith all i had left me was the clothes on my back and a good horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i made up my mind one night that if i could pay my debts and get out of charlestown i would go into the back country and study law and sober down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> braiden in the ordinary who staked me two hundred dollars at rattleandsnap against my horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i left charlestown with honor i studied law at salisbury in north carolina you seem to have the talent said i smiling at the remembrance of the hump gibson incident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is my history in a nutshell said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now he added since you are mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> temples cousin and friend and an old acquaintance of mine to boot i will where is that <end> <end>

<start> <start> temple that he is to come ill warrant him to come said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whereupon we left the inn together more amicably than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jackson had a thoroughbred horse near by that was a pleasure to see and my admiration of his mount seemed to set me as firmly in mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jacksons esteem again as that gentleman himself sat in the saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as good as his word rode out with me some distance on the road and reminded me at the last that nick was to race him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not to my credit that i should have lost the trail after mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the night was dark the country unknown to me and heavily wooded and mountainous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in addition to these things my mind ran like fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my thoughts sometimes flew back to the wondrous summer evening when i trod the nollichucky trace with tom and polly ann when i first looked down upon the log palace of that prince of the border john sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i remembered him broad shouldered handsome gay a courtier in buckskin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> small wonder he was idolized by the watauga settlers that he had been their leader in the struggle of franklin for liberty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and small wonder that nick temple should be in his following <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mind was in a torment concerning him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i went blindly through the woods for hours after the night fell my horse stumbling and weary until at length i came to a lonely clearing on the mountain side and a fierce pack of dogs dashed barking at my horses heels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a dark cabin ahead indistinct in the starlight and there i knocked until a gruff voice answered me and a tousled man came to the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook his head when i asked for the widow browns and bade me share his bed for the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i would go on i was used to the backwoods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon he thawed a little kicked the dogs and pointed to where the mountain dipped against the starstudded sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a trail there which led direct to the widow browns if i could follow it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once the fear had settled deeply of missing nick at the widow browns i put my mind on my journey and thanks to my early training i was able to keep the trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it doubled around the spurs forded stony brooks in diagonals and often in the darkness of the mountain forest i had to feel for the blazes on the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i gained the notch with the small hours of the morning started on with the descent crisscrossing following a stream here and a stream there until at length the song of the higher waters ceased and i knew that i was in the valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly there was no crowncover over my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had gained the road once more and i followed it hopefully avoiding the stumps and the deep wagon ruts where the ground was spongy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the morning light revealed a milky mist through which the trees showed like phantoms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then there came stains upon the mist of royal purple of scarlet of yellow like a mandarins robe peeps of deep blue fading into azure as the mist lifted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the fiery eye of the sun was cocked over the crest and beyond me i saw a house with its logs all golden brown in the level rays the withered cornstalks orange among the blackened stumps <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my horse stopped of his own will at the edge of the clearing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cock crew a lean hound prostrate on the porch of the house rose to his haunches sniffed growled leaped down and ran to the road and sniffed again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i listened startled and made sure of the distant ring of many hoofs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could it be tipton and his men riding from jonesboro to capture sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hoof beats grew louder and then the hound in the road gave tongue to the short sharp bark that is the call to arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other dogs hitherto unseen took up the cry and turning in my saddle i saw a body of men riding hard at me through the alley in the forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at their head on a heavy stronglegged horse was one who might have stood for the figure of turbulence and i made no doubt that this was colonel tipton himselfcolonel tipton once secessionist now champion of the old north state and archenemy of john sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at sight of me he reined up so violently that his horse went back on his haunches and the men behind were near overriding him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> look out boys he shouted with a fierce oath theyve got guards out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flung back one hand to his holster for a pistol while the other reached for the powder flask at his belt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he primed the pan and seeing me immovable set his horse forward at an amble his pistol at the cock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have just this moment come here said i as calmly he glared at me purpling perplexed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton turned to his men who were listening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surround the house he cried and watch this i rode on perforce towards the house with tipton and three others while his men scattered over the cornfield and cursed the dogs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then we saw in the open door the figure of a woman shading her eyes with her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we pulled up five of us before the porch in front of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton leaped from his horse flung the bridle to a companion and put his foot on the edge of the porch to mount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady turned deftly seized a chair from within and pulled it across the threshold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat herself down firmly an expression on her face which hinted that the late lamented mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> colonel tipton stopped staggering from the very impetus of his charge and gazed at her blankly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have come for colonel sevier he blurted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then his anger rising i will have no trifling maam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont tell me answered the widow in a tone that was wholly conversational <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is in this house shouted the colonel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reckon youve guessed wrong colonel said the widow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was an awkward pause until tipton heard a titter behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a warrant against the scoundrel for high treason he cried and by god i will search the house still the widow sat tight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rock of ages was neither more movable nor calmer than she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely colonel you would not invade the house of an the colonel evidently with a great effort throttled his wrath for the moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i regret to have to do so maam said he but both the law <end> <end> 
<start> <start> repeated the widow seemingly tickled at the word <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tipton that the law compels you to arrest such a good friend of yours as colonel sevier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sounds of doors slamming and the hoofclatter of cabhorses and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the london cobblestones came to my ears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a truckload of lighted lamps blazed along the platform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a darkness a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out all things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was there on the other side of the temple and then yes i insisted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was hot and overcast the sky red rimmed with the lingering sunset of midsummer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they sat at the open window trying to fancy the air was fresher there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and dark beyond in the roadway a gas lamp burnt bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farther were the three lights of the railway signal against the lowering sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man and woman spoke to one another in low tones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not he she said peevishly as though that too irritated her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> none of these men of iron have he said sententiously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned her discontented face towards the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew in volume the house quivered one heard the metallic rattle of the tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the train passed there was a glare of light above the cutting and a driving tumult of smoke one two three four five six seven eight black oblongseight truckspassed across the dim grey of the embankment and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the tunnel which with the last seemed to swallow down train smoke and sound in one abrupt gulp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this country was all fresh and beautiful once he said and nowit is gehenna <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down that waynothing but potbanks and chimneys belching fire and dust into the face of heaven but what does it matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an end comes an end to all this cruelty tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke the last word in a whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow she said speaking in a whisper too and still staring out of the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she turned with a start and their eyes searched one anothers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said and then it seems so strange that you should have come into my life like thisto open she paused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all this wonderful world she hesitated and spoke still more softlythis world of love to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they turned their heads and he started violently back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy figuresilent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they saw the face dimly in the halflight with unexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every muscle in rauts body suddenly became tense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the newcomers voice came at last after a pause that seemed interminable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was afraid i had missed you horrocks said the man at the window gripping the windowledge with his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> again she put her head upon his shoulder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and id be a poor sort if i let a sneak shake my confidence in you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he patted her shoulder and there was laughter in his voice as he said but i never professed to be trustworthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh i know you used to she laughed and kissed his cheek <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but while you were engaged to meabout to marry mewhy you simply couldnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you want me to tell you what he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seem to want to get rid of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she sat upright and looked at him for encouragement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went on he said that if i asked you you would not dare deny you wereweregiving her money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then her lips smiled bravely and she said he didnt say anything about her father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was my own correction of his story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him with wonder and doubt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you wish to put it that way said he carelessly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he studied her face then rose took a final pull at the cigarette tossed it in the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must be going he said in a cool even voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not likethis sort of thing he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have evidently found an explanation that satisfies you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he drew himself up in a quiet gesture of haughtiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides it has never been my habit to allow myself to be questioned or to explain myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> precisely what i say said he in the same cool inevitable way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man came to you with a story about me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sufficient answer to the story was that i am marrying you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seized him with desperate fingers cried i am content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you afraid of the scandalbecause everything for the wedding has gone so far <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried sheperhaps too vigorously a woman would have thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what else is there for me to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you certainly havent shown any consideration for me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you told me yourself that you were false to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she forgot her fear in a gush of rage rising from sudden realization of what she was doingof how leniently and weakly and without pride she was dealing with this man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> didnt you admit pardon me said he and his manner might well have calmed the wildest tempest of anger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i leave that to people of the sort who explain and excuse and apologize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply told you i was paying the expenses of a family named hallowell <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could understand how the opposition witnesses dreaded facing him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seemed to me you were admitting i mean you were confirming what that man accused you of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might say of what do you accuse me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she remained silent he went on i am trying to be reasonable josephine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the look in her eyesthe fear the timiditywas a startling revelation of characterof the cowardice with which love undermines the strongest nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know ive been foolish and incoherent fred she pleaded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you remember how i always was afraid of that girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to be admiring you for your generosityyour charity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its neither the one nor the other said he with exasperating deliberateness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are driving me crazy with your evasions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he buttoned his coat in tranquil preparation to depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my fault not asking you straight out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if you are too cross with me thendont tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laughed nervously hiding her submission beneath a seeming of mocking exaggeration of humility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man who admired her as a figure a man who liked her a man who had no feeling for her beyond the general human feeling of wishing well pretty nearly everybodyin brief any man but one who had loved her and had gotten over it would have deeply pitied and sympathized with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fred norman said his look and i am backing mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hallowell in a company for which he is doing chemical research work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are hatching eggs out of the shell so to speak <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also we are aging and rejuvenating arthropods and the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then its only businessnot the girl at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes its the girl too replied he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact it was to make a place for her that i went into the enterprise originally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with an engaging air of frankness he inquired anything more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was gazing soberly almost somberly into the fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll not be offended if i ask you one question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you mean am i having an affair with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hung her head but managed to make a slight nod of assent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he laughed a third time with still stronger and stranger mockery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she congratulated me on my engagement with a sincerity that would have piqued a man who was interested in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what ive just been feeling and saying and putting you throughits beneath both of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose a woman no womancan help being nasty where another woman is concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with his satirical goodhumored smile i dont in the least blame you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youll not think less of me for giving way to a thing so vulgar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he kissed her with a carelessness that made her wince but she felt that she deserved itand was grateful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said why dont you go over and see for yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no doubt tetlow gave you the address and no doubt you have remembered it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you want me to take you over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the laboratory would interest youand miss hallowell is lovelier than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> josephine looked at him with a beautiful smile of love and trust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive said nothing one way or the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think the only reason i had the attack was because mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow so evidently believed he was speaking the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure in the same circumstances id think of anyone else just what he thinks of me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt fair to the girl is it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one but you and tetlow knows im doing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tetlow says a great many people down town are talking about itthat they say you go almost every day to jersey city to see her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he accuses you of having ruined her reputation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course you cannotand it is not best in this case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want you to help me in many ways in making my start <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she said becoming grave i have so many things to think of first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he drew her gently nearer to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment mr dairyman crick mrs crick and two of the milkmaids <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet while her face flushed and her eyes shone in the firelight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know how it would be if i sat so close to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i said to myself they are sure to come and catch us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i wasnt really sitting on his knee though it might ha seemed as if i was almost <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellif so be you hadnt told us i am sure we shouldnt ha noticed that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light replied the dairyman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he continued to his wife with the stolid mien of a man who understood nothing of the emotions relating to matrimonynow christianer that shows that folks should never fancy other folks be supposing things when they baint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o no i should never ha thought a word of where she was a sitting to if she hadnt told me not i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we are going to be married soon said clare with improvised phlegm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i am truly glad to hear it sir <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive thought you mid do such a thing for some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes too good for a dairymaidi said so the very first day i zid herand a prize for any man and whats more a wonderful woman for a gentlemanfarmers wife he wont be at the mercy of his baily wi her at his side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had been even more struck with the look of the girls who followed crick than abashed by cricks blunt praise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after supper when she reached her bedroom they were all present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a light was burning and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed awaiting tess the whole like a row of avenging ghosts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and by a sort of fascination the three girls one after another crept out of their beds and came and stood barefooted round tess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> retty put her hands upon tesss shoulders as if to realize her friends corporeality after such a miracle and the other two laid their arms round her waist all looking into her face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes she murmured as she withdrew her lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was that because of love for her or because other lips have touched there by now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wasnt thinking o that said marian simply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was ony feeling all the strangeness otthat she is to be his wife and nobody else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont say nay to it nor either of us because we did not think of itonly loved him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still nobody else is to marryn in the worldno fine lady nobody in silks and satins but she who do live like we <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are you sure you dont dislike me for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they hung about her in their white nightgowns before replying as if they considered their answer might lie in her look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont knowi dont know murmured retty priddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i want to hate ee but i cannot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats how i feel echoed izz and marian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ought to marry one of you murmured tess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the girls in a low slow whisper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and suddenly tearing away from their clinging arms she burst into a hysterical fit of tears bowing herself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly o yes yes yes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having once given way she could not stop her weeping <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ought to have had one of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i ought to make him even now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you would be better for him thani dont know what im saying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they went up to her and clasped her round but still her sobs tore her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> get some water said marian shes upset by us poor thing poor thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gently led her back to the side of her bed where they kissed her warmly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more ladylike and a better scholar than we especially since he had taught ee so much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i am she said and i am ashamed at so breaking down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were all in bed and the light was out you will think of us when you be his wife tess and of how we told ee that we loved him and how we tried not to hate you and did not hate you and could not hate you because you were his choice and we never hoped to be chose by him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were not aware that at these words salt stinging tears trickled down upon tesss pillow anew and how she resolved with a bursting heart to tell all her history to angel clare despite her mothers commandto let him for whom she lived and breathed despise her if he would and her mother regard her as a fool rather then preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him and which somehow seemed a wrong to these <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this penitential mood kept her from naming the weddingday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the beginning of november found its date still in abeyance though he asked her at the most tempting times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but tesss desire seemed to be for a perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the meads were changing now but it was still warm enough in early afternoons before milking to idle there awhile and the state of dairywork at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun a glistening ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary like the track of moonlight on the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gnats knowing nothing of their brief glorification wandered across the shimmer of this pathway irradiated as if they bore fire within them then passed out of its line and were quite extinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the presence of these things he would remind her that the date was still the question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or he would ask her at night when he accompanied her on some mission invented by mrs crick to give him the opportunity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was mostly a journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale to inquire how the advanced cows were getting on in the strawbarton to which they were relegated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for it was a time of the year that brought great changes to the world of kine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> batches of the animals were sent away daily to this lyingin hospital where they lived on straw till their calves were born after which event and as soon as the calf could walk mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was of course little milking to be done but as soon as the calf had been taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great gravelcliff immediately over the levels where they stood still and listened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water was now high in the streams squirting through the weirs and tinkling under culverts the smallest gullies were all full there was no taking short cuts anywhere and footpassengers were compelled to follow the permanent ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the whole extent of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation it forced upon their fancy that a great city lay below them and that the murmur was the vociferation of its populace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems like tens of thousands of them said tess holding publicmeetings in their marketplaces arguing preaching quarrelling sobbing groaning praying and cursing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did crick speak to you today dear about his not wanting much assistance during the winter months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> six of seven went to the strawbarton yesterday and three the day before making nearly twenty in the straw already <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ahis it that the farmer dont want my help for the calving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> o i am not wanted here any more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i have tried so hard to crick didnt exactly say that he would no longer require you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but knowing what our relations were he said in the most goodnatured and respectful manner possible that he supposed on my leaving at christmas i should take you with me and on my asking what he would do without you he merely observed that as a matter of fact it was a time of year when he could do with a very little female help <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid i was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this way forcing your hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think you ought to have felt glad angel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because tis always mournful not to be wanted even if at the same time tis convenient <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel the red rising up at her having been caught <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to decline to marry him after allin obedience to her emotion of last nightand leave the dairy meant to go to some strange place not a dairy for milkmaids were not in request now calvingtime was coming on to go to some arable farm where no divine being like angel clare was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hated the thought and she hated more the thought of going home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so that seriously dearest tess he continued since you will probably have to leave at christmas it is in every way desirable and convenient that i should carry you off then as my property <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would know that we could not go on like this for ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it would always be summer and autumn and you always courting me and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summertime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she cried with a sudden fervour of faith in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> angel i will fix the day when i will become yours for always <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus at last it was arranged between them during that dark walk home amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they reached the dairy mr and mrs crick were promptly toldwith injunctions of secrecy for each of the lovers was desirous that the marriage should be kept as private as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the dairyman though he had thought of dismissing her soon now made a great concern about losing her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> who would make the ornamental butterpats for the anglebury and sandbourne ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mrs crick congratulated tess on the shillyshallying having at last come to an end and said that directly she set eyes on tess she divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival that she was of a good family she could have sworn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in point of fact mrs crick did remember thinking that tess was graceful and goodlooking as she approached but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours without the sense of a will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the word had been given the number of the day written down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the fatalistic convictions common to fieldfolk and those who associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their fellowcreatures and she accordingly drifted into that passive responsiveness to all things her lover suggested characteristic of the frame of mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she wrote anew to her mother ostensibly to notify the weddingday really to again implore her advice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a gentleman who had chosen her which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a postnuptial explanation which might be accepted with a light heart by a rougher man might not be received with the same feeling by him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this communication brought no reply from mrs durbeyfield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> despite angel clares plausible representation to himself and to tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step as became apparent at a later date <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he loved her dearly though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had entertained no notion when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unsophistication was a thing to talk of but he had not known how it really struck one until he came here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider himself fairly started in life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the secret lay in the tinge of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you think twould have been better for us to wait till you were quite settled in your midland farm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a midland farm was the idea to tell the truth my tess i dont like you to be left anywhere away from my protection and sympathy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the reason was a good one so far as it went <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover with a desperado of that sort one never knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the object was not to get him out that was as well as done already but to step into his place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bizarre as the thought seemed he might have shown fight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fellow up to working such a fraud would have enough cheek for anything a fellow that as it were stood up against god almighty himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a horrid marvelthats what he was he was perfectly capable of brazening out the affair scandalously till he got him sterne kicked out of the ship and everlast ingly damaged his prospects in this part of the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet if you want to get on something must be risked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times sterne thought he had been unduly timid of taking action in the past and what was worse it had come to this that in the present he did not seem to know what action to take <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an incalculable factor of the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you could not tell what there was behind that insulting ferocity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could one trust such a temper it did not put sterne in bodily fear for himself but it frightened him exceedingly as to his prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though of course inclined to credit himself with ex ceptional powers of observation he had by now lived too long with his discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had gone on looking at nothing else till at last one day it occurred to him that the thing was so obvious that no one could miss seeing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were four white men in all on board the sofala <end> <end> 
<start> <start> jack the second engineer was too dull to notice anything that took place out of his engineroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> remained massythe ownerthe interested person nearly going mad with worry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne had heard and seen more than enough on board to know what ailed him but his exasperation seemed to make him deaf to cau tious overtures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had only known it there was the very thing he wanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how could you bargain with a man of that sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was like going into a tigers den with a piece of raw meat in your hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was as likely as not to rend you for your pains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact he was always threatening to do that very thing and the urgency of the case combined with the impossibility of handling it with safety made sterne in his watches below toss and mutter openeyed in his bunk for hours as though he had been burning with fever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> occurrences like the crossing of the bar just now were extremely alarming to his prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not want to be left behind by some swift catastrophe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massy be ing on the bridge the old man had to brace himself up and make a show he supposed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it was getting very bad with him very bad indeed now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even massy had been emboldened to find fault this time sterne listen ing at the foot of the ladder had heard the others whimpering and artless denunciations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> luckily the beast was very stupid and could not see the why of all this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however small blame to him it took a clever man to hit upon the cause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nevertheless it was high time to do something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old mans game could not be kept up for many days more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may yet lose my life at this foolinglet alone my chance sterne mumbled angrily to himself after the stooping back of the chief engineer had disappeared round the corner of the skylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes no doubthe thought but to blurt out his knowledge would not ad vance his prospects <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the contrary it would blast them utterly as likely as not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had a vague consciousness of not being much liked by his fellows in this part of the world inex plicably enough for he had done nothing to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people were always down on a clever chap who made no bones about his determination to get on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to do your duty and count on the gratitude of that brute massy would be sheer folly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a brute without a spark of anything human about him without so much as simple curiosity even or else surely he would have responded in some way to all these hints he had been given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> massys state of exasperation seemed to sterne to have made him stupid beyond the ordinary silliness of shipowners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sterne meditating on the embarrassments of that stu pidity forgot himself completely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his stony unwink ing stare was fixed on the planks of the deck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the slight quiver agitating the whole fabric of the ship was more perceptible in the silent river shaded and still like a forest path <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sofala gliding with an even motion had passed beyond the coastbelt of mud and mangroves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shores rose higher in firm slop ing banks and the forest of big trees came down to the brink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where the earth had been crumbled by the floods it showed a steep brown cut denuding a mass of roots intertwined as if wrestling underground and in the air the interlaced boughs bound and loaded with creepers carried on the struggle for life mingled their foliage in one solid wall of leaves with here and there the shape of an enormous dark pillar soaring or a ragged opening as if torn by the flight of a cannon ball disclosing the impenetrable gloom within the secular inviolable shade of the virgin forest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thump of the engines reverberated regularly like the strokes of a metronome beating the measure of the vast silence the shadow of the western wall had fallen across the river and the smoke pouring backwards from the funnel eddied down behind the ship spread a thin dusky veil over the somber water which checked by the floodtide seemed to lie stagnant in the whole straight length of the reaches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i entered the redoute with my head full of sham barons german catalinas and the thousandand one popular tales of renowned knights of the green cloththeir seducing confederates and infatuated dupes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rooms are well distributed the saloons handsome <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a sparkling of ladies apparently and really as i understood of the best water the elite in short of aixlachapelle were lounging on sofas placed round the principal saloon or fluttering about amidst a crowd of men who filled up the centre of the room or thronged round the tables that were ranged on one side of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the players continued their occupation in deathlike silence undisturbed by the buzz or the gaze of the lookerson not a sound was heard but the rattle of the heapedup money as it was passed from one side of the table to the other nor was the smallest anxiety or emotion visible on any countenance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scene was unpleasing though to me curious from its novelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ladies are admitted to play but there were none occupied this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was glad of it indeed though english travellers are accused of carrying about with them a portable code of morality which dissolves or stiffens like a soapcake as circumstances may affect its consistency yet i sincerely believe that there are few amongst us who would not feel shocked at seeing one of the reminiscences of the rhine c <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gambling here in has been described in a very vivid manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since the enforcement of the prussian sunday observance regulations monday has become the great day of the week for the banks of the german gambling establishments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anxious to make up for lost time the regular contributors to the companys dividends flock early on monday forenoon to the playrooms in order to secure good places at the tables which by the appointed hour for commencing operations eleven oclock are closely hedged round by persons of both sexes eagerly waiting for the first deal of the cards or the initial twist of the brass wheel that they may try another fall with fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before each seated player are arranged precious little piles of gold and silver a card printed in black and red and a long pin wherewith to prick out a system of infallible gain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the croupiers take their seats and unpack the strong box rouleaux long metal sausages composed of double and single florins wooden bowls brimming over with gold frederics and napoleons bank notes of all sizes and colours are arranged upon the black leather compartment ruled over by the companys officers halfadozen packs of new cards are stripped of their paper cases and swiftly shuffled together and when all these preliminaries watched with breathless anxiety by the surrounding speculators have been gravely and carefully executed the chief croupier looks round hima signal for the prompt investment of capital on all parts of the tablechucks out a handful of cards from the mass packed together convenient to his handejaculates the formula faites le jeu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after half a minutes pause during which he delicately moistens the ball of his dealing thumb exclaims le jeu est fait rien ne va plus and proceeds to interpret the decrees of fate according to the approved fashion of trente et quarante <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a similar scene is taking place at the roulette tablea goodly crop of florins with here and there a speck of gold shining amongst the silver harvest is being sown over the field of the cloth of green soon to be reaped by the croupiers sickle and the pith ball is being dropped into the revolving basin that is partitioned off into so many tiny black and red niches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the next twelve hours the processes in question are carried on swiftly and steadily without variation or loss of time relays of croupiers are laid on who unobtrusively slip into the places of their fellows when the hours arrive for relieving guard the game is never stopped for more than a couple of minutes at a time viz <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the cards run out and have to be reshuffled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this brief interruption is commonly considered to portend a break in the particular vein which the game may have happened to assume during the dealsay a run upon black or red an alternation of coups in threes or fours upon either colour two reds and a black or vice versa all equally frequent eccentricities of the cards and the heavier players often change their seats or leave the table altogether for an hour or so at such a conjuncture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> curiously enough excepting at the very commencement of the days play the habitues of the trente et quarante tables appear to entertain a strong antipathy to the first deal or two after the cards have been remade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been told by one or two masters of the craft that they have a fancy to see how matters are likely to go before they strike in as if it were possible to deduce the future of the game from its past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that it is possible appears to be an article of faith with the old stagers and indeed every now and then odd coincidences occur which tend to confirm them in their creed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i witnessed an occurrence which was either attributable as i believe to sheer chance or as its hero earnestly assured me to instinct <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fair and frail magyar was punting on numbers with immense pluck and uniform ill fortune <end> <end> 
<start> <start> behind her stood a viennese gentleman of my acquaintance who enjoys a certain renown amongst his friends for the faculty of prophecy which however he seldom exercises for his own benefit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observing that she hesitated about staking her double florin he advised her to set it on the number round went the wheel and in twenty seconds the ball tumbled into compartment sure enough <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the next turn she asked his advice and was told to try number no sooner said than done and came up in due course whereby mdlle l <end> <end> 
<start> <start> won odd gulden in two coups the amount risked by her being exactly four florins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like a wise girl she walked off with her booty and played no more that day at roulette <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few minutes later i saw an englishman go through the performance of losing four thousand francs by experimentalizing on single numbers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> twenty times running did he set ten louisdors on a number varying the number at each stake and not one of his selection proved successful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the thirty and forty i saw an eminent diplomatist win sixty thousand francs with scarcely an intermission of failure he played all over the table pushing his rouleaux backwards and forwards from black to red without any appearance of system that i could detect and the cards seemed to follow his inspiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a great battle as usual three or four smaller fish followed in his wake till they lost courage and set against him much to their discomfiture and the advantage of the bank but from first to lastthat is till the cards ran out and he left the tablehe was steadily victorious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the evening he went in again for another heavy bout at which i chanced to be present but fortune had forsaken him and he not only lost his mornings winnings but eight thousand francs to boot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not remember to have ever seen the tables so crowdedoutside it was thundering lightening and raining as if the world were coming to an end and the whole floating population of wiesbaden was driven into the kursaal by the weather <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a roaring time of it had the bank when play was over about which time the rain ceased hundreds of hot and thirsty gamblers streamed out of the reeking rooms to the glazed in terrace and the next hour always the pleasantest of the twentyfour here and in hombourgat ems people go straight from the tables to bedwas devoted to animated chat and unlimited sherrycobbler all the events of the day were passed in review experiences exchanged and confessions made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nobody had won i could not hear of a single great successthe bank had had it all its own way and most of the lions worsted in the fray had evidently made up their minds to drown it in the bowl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the russian detachmenta very strong one this yearwas especially hard hit spain and italy were both unusually low spirited and there was an extra solemnity about the british isles that told its own sad tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> englishmen when they have lost more than they can afford generally take it out of themselves in surly brooding selfreproach <end> <end> 
<start> <start> frenchmen give vent to their disgust and annoyance by abusing the game and its myrmidons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may hear them loud and savage on the terrace ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> comment peuton se laisser eplucher par des brigands de la sorte <end> <end> 
<start> <start> italians again endeavour to conceal their discomfiture under a flow of feverish gaiety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> light up their cigars drink a dozen or so hocks and subside into their usual state of ponderous cheerfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> russians betray no emotion whatever over their calamities save perhaps that they smoke those famous little laferme cigarettes a trifle faster and more nervously than at other times but they are excellent winners and magnificent losers only to be surpassed in either respect by their old enemy the turk who is facile princeps in the art of hiding his feelings from the outer world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great mass of visitors at wiesbaden this season as at hombourg belong to the middle and lower middle classes leavened by a very few celebrities and persons of genuine distinction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are a dozen or two eminent men here not to be seen in the playrooms who are taking the waterslord clarendon baron rothschild prince souvarof and a few morebut the general run of guests is by no means remarkable for birth wealth or respectability and we are shockingly off for ladies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a setoff against this deficiency it would seem that all the aged brokendown courtesans of paris vienna and berlin have agreed to make wiesbaden their autumn rendezvous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> arrayed in all the colours of the rainbow painted up to the roots of their dyed hair shamelessly decolletees prodigal of free talk and unseemly gesture these ghastly creatures hideous caricatures of youth and beauty flaunt about the playrooms and gardens levying blackmail upon those who are imprudent enough to engage them in chaff or badinage and desperately endeavouring to hook themselves on to the wealthier and younger members of the male community <end> <end> 
<start> <start> down to that year there were no less than gaming houses in st jamess and st georges <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the play was higher in old times but not so general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the increase of gambling houses was entirely the offspring of crockfords <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such was the opinion of the honourable frederick byng before the committee who added that the facility to everybody to gamble at crockfords led to the establishment of other gambling houses fitted up in a superior style and attractive to gentlemen who never would have thought of going previously in the clubs the gambling was confined to a very high rate and to a very few people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the abovenamed witness said he could have named all the gamblers in his early days at the clubs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no person coming into a room where hazard was carried on would have been permitted to play for a small sum and therefore the same gentleman remembered the time when gambling tables were kept in private houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a fact that most of those who played very high were pretty crockford increased gambling everywhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> persons of the middling classes butchers and gentlemans servants went to the these places held out inducements to robbery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if a servant or shopman could scrape together l or l he had by the agency of the keepers of these houses the opportunity of lending out desperation at gaming houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the most particular inspection was made of the players person by the gaming house keepers spies and even his dress was strictly observed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was obliged before entering the saloon to deposit his great coat and cane which might perchance afford the introduction of some weapon and the elegance of the covering did not save him from the humiliation of having it taken from him at the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the attempts which were sometimes made on the lives of the bankers led to these precautionslike the indignities which are practised only in prisons for the security of the unhappy inmates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is certain that gamesters reduced to desperation and on the eve of committing suicide have conveyed into these places infernal machines with an intention of destroying at once their cruel plunderers and themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in doings in london a work published as lately as the year we find under this startling title a strange story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a scandalous scene of violence which often happens at these places but seldom becomes publicly known on account of the disgrace attending exposures occurred lately at a low hell in king street st jamess <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gentleman who had lost considerable sums of money at various times announced his full determination never to come to a place of the sort again with money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his visits therefore were no longer wanted and so orders were given to the porters not to admit him again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about two oclock on a subsequent night which happened to be saturday he sought admittance and was refused <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a warm altercation ensued in the passage between him and the porters which brought down some of the proprietors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of thema powerful mana bankrupt butcherstruck him a tremendous blow which broke the bridge of his nose covered his face with blood and knocked him down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on getting up he was knocked down again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he arose once more and instantly received another blow which would have laid him upon his back but one of the porters by this time had got behind him and as he was falling struck him at the back of his head which sent him upon his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the watch had now arrived into whose hands the keeper of the hell and the porter were given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the watchhouse they were ordered to find bail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the gentleman was then about quitting when he was suddenly called back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a certain little lawyer who alternately prosecutes and defends keepers of gaming houses was sent for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he whispered to the ex butcher to charge the gentleman with stealing his handkerchief and hat which it was alleged had been lost in the affray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though nothing was found upon the gentleman who desired to be searched this preposterous and groundless charge was taken and the hellites admitted to bail but the gentleman who had been so cruelly beaten being charged with a felony on purpose to cause his detention and the power held by magistrates to take bail in doubtful cases not extending to nightconstables he was locked up below with two wretches who had stolen lead and five disorderlieshis face a mass of blood and bruisesand there detained till monday morning in a most pitiable condition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the magistrate before whom the party appeared on that day understanding that the affair took place at a gaming house dismissed both complaints leaving the parties to their remedy at gaffing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gaffing is or was one of the ten thousand modes of swindling practised in london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> formerly it was a game in very great vogue among the macers who congregated nightly at the flash houses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of these is described as followsthis gaffer laughed a great deal and whistled moores melodies and extracted music from a deal table with his elbow and wrist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he hid a halfpenny and a flat cried head for l a tail was sure to turn up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of his modes of commanding the turnup was this he had a halfpenny with two heads and a halfpenny with two tails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he gaffed he contrived to have both halfpence under his hand and long practice enabled him to catch up in the wrinkles or muscles of it the halfpenny which it was his interest to conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if tail was called a head appeared and the tail halfpenny ran down his wrist with astonishing fidelity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this ingenious fellow often won or sovereigns a night by gaffing but the landlord and other men who were privy to the robbery and pitched the baby card that is encouraged the loser by sham betting always came in for the regulars that is their share of the plunder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this gaffer contrived to bilk all the turnpikes in the kingdom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in going to a fight or to a racecourse when he reached a turnpike he held a shilling between his fingers and said to the gatekeeperhere catch and made a movement of the hand towards the man who endeavoured to catch what he saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shilling however by a backward jerk ran down the sleeve of the coat as if it had life in it and the gatekeeper turned round to look in the dust when the tall gaffer drove on sayingkeep a young fellow who previously was a marker at a billiardtable and who had the appearance of a soft inexperienced countrylad was another great hand at gaffing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a strong adhesive power in his hand and such exquisite sensibility about it that he could ascertain by dropping his palm even upon a wornout halfpenny or shilling what side was turned up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed so perfect a master was he of the science that breslaw could never have done more upon cards than he could do with a pair of grays gaffingcoins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a wellknown macer who was celebrated for slipping an old gentleman a long card into the pack and was the inheritor by birth of all the propensities of this description although the inheritance was equally divided between his brother and himself got hold of a young fellow who had l in his pocket and introduced him to one of the cockandhen houses near drury lane theatre wellprimed with wine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gaffing began and the billiardmarker before described was pitched upon to do the stranger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the macer pitched the baby card and of course lost as well as the unfortunate victim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had borrowed l of the landlord who was to come in for the regulars but when all was over the billiardmarker refused to make any division of the spoil or even to return the l which had been lost to him in bearing up the cull <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the landlord pressed his demand upon the macer who in fact was privately reimbursed by the marker but he was coolly told that he ought not to allow such improper practices in his house and that the sum was not recoverable the transaction being illegal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how these spurious coins are procured is a question but i am assured that they are still in use and often made to do service at publichouses and other places <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is a mode of gambling very much in vogue at the present time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is often played at publichouses among parties to decide who is to pay the reckoning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each party turns down a halfpenny and on uncovering it the matter is decided as in heads or tails <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course this expeditious method is also used in gambling for money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not long ago a retired tradesman happening to be in a publichouse where such things were connived at allowed himself to be induced to play at tommy dodd with two low sharpers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they soon eased him of all the cash he had about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stop a bit he said i must have my revenge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just wait till i go home for more money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lay dead in the cold cold ground moon and stars and rain on the hill in his side and breast were bloody wounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> woe woe is me for the fair ladye and the poor knight he the poor knight ah <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the maiden sat her down to die cold cold earth on her lovers breast and the little birds rang mournfully and the moonshine kissed her tenderly and the stars looked down right pityingly on the poor fair maid and the poor cold knight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this mournful song was no sooner ended than supper was served and the company proved themselves good trenchermen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hilarius caught sight of the seditious friar making short work of the convents victuals and marvelled to see him in a place to which he had given so evil a name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin was unfeignedly glad to see the lad and listened intently to his tale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he nodded his head as hilarius related how the friar he companied with preached in each village that men should repent ere the scourge of god fell upon them but there is naught of it as yet said the lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nay nay it is like a thief in the night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day it is not and then the next men sicken and fall like blasted wheat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i heard a bruit of london that it was but a heap of graves nay one grave rather for they flung the bodies into a great trench there was no time to do otherwise black death is swift with his stroke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then hilarius told of piping hugh and the friars deathwords to the guests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> martin swore a round oath and slapped his thigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now know i that thy friar is a proper man an he has set a curse on piping hugh of mildenhall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a foulmouthed knave with many a black deed to his name and blood on his hands if men say truth and yet there was never a bird that would not come at his call and i never heard tell that he harmed one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he had heard the story of the friars twicerepeated vision and quest the minstrel sat silent awhile with knitted brow and head sunk on his breast then he eyed hilarius half humorously half tenderly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> methinks lad an thy friar alloweth it i will even go to bungay with thee for i love thee well lad and would have thy company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also i like not the matter of the vision and would fain see the end of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could see no accessory she knew of that was missing and there were many things to which she never had been accustomed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the harvester had gone back to the sunshine room and was kneeling on the floor beside the bundle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began opening boxes and handing her dresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are skirt coat and waist hangers on the hooks he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only got a few things to start on because i didnt know what you would like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead of being so careful with that dress why dont you take it off and put on a common one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we will have something to eat and go to the top of the hill and watch while she hung the dresses and selected the one to wear he placed the mattress spread the padding and sheets and encased the pillow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he bent and pressed the springs with his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think you will find that soft and easy enough for health he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the personal belongings i had that clerk put up for you are in that chest of drawers there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put the little boxes in the top and went down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just hunt out what you will need now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there should be everything a girl uses there somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told them to be very careful about that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the things are not right or not to your taste you can take them back as soon as you are rested and they will exchange them for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there is anything i have missed that you can think the girl turned toward him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you couldnt be making sport of me she said but man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cant you see that i dont know what to do with half you have here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother would have known but i do not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fifty times ive tried to tell you that a room of my very own such a room as this will be when tomorrows sun comes in and these and these and these she turned from the chest of boxes to the dressing table bed closet and bath all these for me and you know absolutely nothing about mei get a big lump in my throat and the words that do come all seem so meaningless i am perfectly ashamed to say them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh man why do i thought it was about time to spring another why on me said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank god i am now in a position where i can tell you why <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do it because you are the girl of my dream my mate by every law of heaven and earth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all men build as well as they know when the one woman of the universe lays her spell on them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did all this for myself just as a kind of expression of what it would be in my heart to do if i could do what id like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put on the easiest dress you can she stood with arms high piled with the prettiest dresses that could be selected hurriedly the tears running down her white cheeks and smiled through them at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there wouldnt be any of that liquid amber would there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he questioned as he handed her the glass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she heaped the dresses on the bed and took it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think it possibly can hurt you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how soon will you be ready for you will when you see and smell it said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there wont be much tonight because i want you he went away and the girl removed her dress and spread it on the couch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she saw the discoloured cloth it proved that she had been painted and made her very indignant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet she could not be altogether angry for that flush of colour had saved the harvester from being pitied by his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she stood a long time before the mirror staring at her gaunt colourless face then she went to the dressing table and committed a crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she found a box of cream and rubbed it on for a foundation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she opened some pink powder and carefully dusted her cheeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am utterly ashamed she said to the image in the mirror but he has done so much for me he is so so i dont know a word big enoughthat i cant bear him to see how ghastly i am how little worth it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps the food better air and outdoor exercise will give me strength and colour soon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> until it does im afraid im going to help out all i can with this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i really appear like a girl instead then she looked over the dresses selected a pretty white princesse slipped it on and went to the kitchen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the harvester would not have her there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he seated her at the dining table beside the window overlooking the lake lighted a pair of his homemade candles in his finest sticks and placed before her bread butter cold meat milk and fruit and together they ate their first meal in their home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i had known said the harvester granny moreland is a famous cook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she is a southern woman and she can fry chicken and make some especial dishes to surpass any one i ever knew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would have been id much rather have this and be by ourselves said the girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well you can bank on it i would agreed the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance if any one were here i might feel restrained about telling you that you are exactly the beautiful flushed dream girl i have adored for months and your dress most becoming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are oh why did you say that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now ive got to feel like a sneak or tell youand i didnt dont you ever tell me or any one else anything you dont want to said the harvester roundly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was fool enough to think you wouldnt notice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt know they were doing it but when it all washed off i looked so ghastly i almost frightened myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hunted through the boxes they put up for but dont all the daintiest women powder these days and consider it indispensable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the clerk said so and ive noticed it mentioned in the papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bought yes just powder but man i put on a lot of cold cream first to stick the powder good and thick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh well since youve told it is your conscience perfectly at ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are lovely and if you dont use enough powder to cover the paleness until your colour returns ill hold you and put it on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you feel better when you you are no such thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there hasnt a woman in ten thousand got any such rope of hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been seeing the papers on the hair question too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if they think your hair is false when it is natural they wont be any more fooled when they think your colour is real and it isnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very soon it will be and no one need ever know the difference <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you go on and fix up your level best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to see yourself appearing well will make you harvesterman said the girl gazing at him with wet luminous eyes for the sake of other women i could wish that all men had an oath to keep and had here is the place we adjourn to the moon cried the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know of anything that can cure a sudden accession of swell head like gazing at the heavens <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one finds his place among the atoms naturally and instantaneously with the eyes on the night sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe there is one among my orders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but upstairs with mothers clothing there are several shawls and shoulder capes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all of them were washed and carefully packed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wouldnt she like me to wear her things better than to have them lying in moth the harvester looked at her and shook his head marvelling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant tell how pleased she would be he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could use them to help furnish the house and it wouldnt the harvester liked that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the washed things are in those boxes upstairs also some fine skins ive saved on the chance of wanting them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her dishes are in the bottom of the china closet there she was mighty proud of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the furniture and carpets were so old and abused i burned them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill he took the candle and climbed the stairs soon returning with a little white wool shawl and a big pink coverlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got this for her christmas one time he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shed he folded it around the girls shoulders and picked up the coverlet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre never going to take that to the woods <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she took it in her hands to find a corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its one of the things that money cant buy or rather one that takes a mint of money to own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the art store where i worked theyd give you fifty dollars for that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not faded or worn a particle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would be lovely in my room you mustnt take a ruth are you in earnest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i have them to help furnish with certainly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything you can find any way on earth you want it only in my room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is taboo as i told isnt the rug you had in the woods in the wagon yet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing worth carrying away except what you have on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is a big swamp back of our woods marsh in front were up here where we can see the drive and bridge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never locked the cabin in my life except your room and that was because it was sacred a coon that might go shuffling across an opossum or a snake going to the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the path is broad and white and surely you you are indeed said the harvester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now see he indicated the hill sloping toward the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the path wound among massive trees between whose branches patches of moonlight filtered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> around the lake shore and climbing the hill were thickets of bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water lay shining in the light a gentle wind ruffled the surface in undulant waves and on the opposite bank arose the line of big trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under a giant oak widely branching on the top of the hill the harvester spread the rug and held one end of it against the tree trunk to protect the girls dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he sat a little distance away and began to talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he mingled some sense with a quantity of nonsense and appreciated every hint of a laugh he heard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the day had been no amusing matter for a girl absolutely alone among strange people and scenes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anything more foreign to her previous environment or expectations he could not imagine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he talked to prevent her from thinking and worked for a laugh as he laboured for bread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now we must go he said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if there is the malaria i strongly suspect in your system this night air is none too good for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i only wanted you to see the lake the first night in your new home and if it wont shock you i brought you here because this is my holy of holies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> can you guess why i wanted you to come if i wasnt so stupid with alternate burning and chills and so deadened to every proper sensibility i suppose i could she answered but im not brilliant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont know unless it is because you knew it would be the loveliest place i ever saw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> surely there is no other then would it seem strange to you asked the harvester going to the girl and gently putting his arms around her would it seem strange to you that a woman who once homed here and thought it the prettiest place on earth chose to remain for her eternal sleep rather he felt the girl tremble against him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she used to say that she had a speaking acquaintance with every tree on our land and of them all she loved this big one the best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she liked to come here in winter and feel the sting of the wind sweeping across the lake and in summer this was her place to read and to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was much as if a boat on which he had been floating smoothly down the stream of pleasure had sunk suddenly and left him struggling in deep waters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the full realization of the truth which followed speedily had for the moment reversed his mental attitude toward her and love and yearning had given place to anger and disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his agitation could hardly have escaped notice had not the doctors attention and that of the crowd that quickly gathered been absorbed by the young woman who had fallen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the time occupied in carrying her into the drugstore restoring her to consciousness and sending her home in a carriage tryon had time to recover in some degree his selfpossession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when rena had been taken home he slipped away for a long walk after which he called at judge straights office and received the judges report upon the matter presented <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge straight had found the claim in his opinion a good one he had discovered property from which in case the claim were allowed the amount might be realized <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge who had already been informed of the incident at the drugstore observed tryons preoccupation and guessed shrewdly at its cause but gave no sign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryon left the matter of the note unreservedly in the lawyers hands with instructions to communicate to him any further developments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> returning to the doctors office tryon listened to that genial gentlemans comments on the accident his own concern in which he by a great effort was able to conceal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor insisted upon his returning to the hill for supper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the doctor was solicitous felt his pulse examined his tongue pronounced him feverish and prescribed a sedative <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryon sought refuge in his room at the hotel from which he did not emerge again until morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first he could see nothing but the fraud of which he had been made the victim <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a negro girl had been foisted upon him for a white woman and he had almost committed the unpardonable sin against his race of marrying her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such a step he felt would have been criminal at any time it would have been the most odious treachery at this epoch when his people had been subjugated and humiliated by the northern invaders who had preached negro equality and abolished the wholesome laws decreeing the separation of the races <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but no southerner who loved his poor downtrodden country or his race the proud anglosaxon race which traced the clear stream of its blood to the cavaliers of england could tolerate the idea that even in distant generations that unsullied current could be polluted by the blood of slaves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the very thought was an insult to the white people of the south <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for tryons liberality of which he had spoken so nobly and so sincerely had been confined unconsciously and as a matter of course within the boundaries of his own race <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the southern mind in discussing abstract questions relative to humanity makes always consciously or unconsciously the mental reservation that the conclusions reached do not apply to the negro unless they can be made to harmonize with the customs of the country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but reasoning thus was not without effect upon a mind by nature reasonable above the average <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tryons race impulse and social prejudice had carried him too far and the swing of the mental pendulum brought his thoughts rapidly back in the opposite direction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tossing uneasily on the bed where he had thrown himself down without undressing the air of the room oppressed him and he threw open the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cool night air calmed his throbbing pulses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moonlight streaming through the window flooded the room with a soft light in which he seemed to see rena standing before him as she had appeared that afternoon gazing at him with eyes that implored charity and forgiveness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he burst into tears bitter tears that strained his heartstrings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was his first love and he had lost her forever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was worse than dead to him for if he had seen her lying in her shroud before him he could at least have cherished her memory now even this consolation was denied him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the town clockwhich so long as it was wound up regularly recked nothing of love or hate joy or sorrowsolemnly tolled out the hour of midnight and sounded the knell of his lost love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lost she was as though she had never been as she had indeed had no right to be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he resolutely determined to banish her image from his mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see her again he could not it would be painful to them both it could be productive of no good to either <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had felt the power and charm of love and no ordinary shook could have loosened its hold but this catastrophe which had so rudely swept away the groundwork of his passion had stirred into new life all the slumbering pride of race and ancestry which characterized his caste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much of this sensitive superiority was essential and how much accidental how much of it was due to the eversuggested comparison with a servile race how much of it was ignorance and selfconceit to what extent the boasted purity of his race would have been contaminated by the fair woman whose image filled his memoryof these things he never thought <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not influenced by sordid considerations he would have denied that his course was controlled by any narrow prudence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if rena had been white pure white for in his creed there was no compromise he would have braved any danger for her sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had she been merely of illegitimate birth he would have overlooked the bar sinister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had her people been simply poor and of low estate he would have brushed aside mere worldly considerations and would have bravely sacrificed convention for love for his liberality was not a mere form of words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the one objection which he could not overlook was unhappily the one that applied to the only woman who had as yet moved his heart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to be angry with her but after the first hour he found it impossible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a man of too much imagination not to be able to put himself in some measure at least in her placeto perceive that for her the step which had placed her in tryons world was the working out of natures great law of self preservation for which he could not blame her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but for the sheerest accidentno rather but for a providential interferencehe would have married her and might have gone to the grave unconscious that she was other than she seemed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a shiver he closed the window undressed by the moonlight drew down the shade and went to bed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell into an unquiet slumber and dreamed again of rena <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he must learn to control his waking thoughts his dreams could not be curbed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that realm renas image was for many a day to remain supreme <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dreamed of her sweet smile her soft touch her gentle voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in all her fair young beauty she stood before him and then by some hellish magic she was slowly transformed into a hideous black hag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with agonized eyes he watched her beautiful tresses become mere wisps of coarse wool wrapped round with dingy cotton strings he saw her clear eyes grow bloodshot her ivory teeth turn to unwholesome fangs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a shudder he awoke to find the cold gray dawn of a rainy day stealing through the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he rose dressed himself went down to breakfast then entered the writingroom and penned a letter which after reading it over he tore into small pieces and threw into the waste basket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> giving up the task he left the hotel and walked down to dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no suh replied the man hes gone ter see de young cullud gal wat fainted wen de doctah was wid you yistiddy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the long silences the howling of the wind and the beating of the rain were distinctly audible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman sat perfectly still watching the clock determined to stay till the stroke of eleven but not a moment longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre had turned her back to the circle and had been standing for some time within the uplifted curtain of a window with her forehead against the pane gazing out into the deluged darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for heavens sake she said with peculiar eagerness go to the piano and play something <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde held up her tapestry and pointed to a little white flower <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am in the midst of a masterpiece <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my flower is going to smell very sweet i am putting in the smell with this goldcolored silk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am holding my breath i cant leave off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is absurd for me to play when you are present said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the next moment she went to the piano and began to strike the keys with vehemence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she played for some time rapidly and brilliantly when she stopped newman went to the piano and asked her to begin again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she shook her head and on his insisting she said i have not been playing for you i have been playing for myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she went back to the window again and looked out and shortly afterwards left the room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when newman took leave urbain de bellegarde accompanied him as he always did just three steps down the staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the bottom stood a servant with his overcoat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had just put it on when he saw madame de cintre coming towards him across the vestibule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him a moment before answering his question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont like my mother and my brother she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hesitated a moment and then he said softly no <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she laid her hand on the balustrade and prepared to ascend the stairs fixing her eyes on the first step <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i shall be at home on friday and she passed up the wide dusky staircase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the friday as soon as he came in she asked him to please to tell her why he disliked her family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish you would tell me what you think of them said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think of any of them but you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i dont exactly love your brother said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what is the use of my saying so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are too goodnatured said madame de cintre gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then as if to avoid the appearance of inviting him to speak ill of the marquis she turned away motioning him to sit down <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he remained standing before her and said presently what is of much more importance is that they dont like me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont believe i am a man to dislike <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose that a man who may be liked may also be disliked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and my brothermy mother she added have not made you angry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they think they have treated you very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no doubt they might have handled me much more roughly said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they dont think i am as good as they are <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant even agree with you without saying something that has a disagreeable sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman sat down and looked at her for some time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when you say it i believe it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a poor reason said madame de cintre smiling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have a high spirit a high standard but with you its all natural and unaffected you dont seem to have stuck your head into a vise as if you were sitting for the photograph of propriety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you think of me as a fellow who has had no idea in life but to make money and drive sharp bargains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats a fair description of me but it is not the whole story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man ought to care for something else though i dont know exactly what <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cared for moneymaking but i never cared particularly for the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing else to do and it was impossible to be idle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been very easy to others and to myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have done most of the things that people asked mei dont mean rascals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as regards your mother and your brother newman added there is only one point upon which i feel that i might quarrel with them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont ask them to sing my praises to you but i ask them to let you alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i thought they talked ill of me to you i should come down upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they have let me alone as you say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that case cried newman i declare they are only too good for this world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre appeared to find something startling in his exclamation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she would perhaps have replied but at this moment the door was thrown open and urbain de bellegarde stepped across the threshold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he appeared surprised at finding newman but his surprise was but a momentary shadow across the surface of an unwonted joviality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman had never seen the marquis so exhilarated his pale unlighted countenance had a sort of thin transfiguration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held open the door for some one else to enter and presently appeared old madame de bellegarde leaning on the arm of a gentleman whom newman had not seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had already risen and madame de cintre rose as she always did before her mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis who had greeted newman almost genially stood apart slowly rubbing his hands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave a majestic little nod at newman and then she released the strange gentleman that he might make his bow to her daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my daughter she said i have brought you an unknown relative lord deepmere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lord deepmere is our cousin but he has done only today what he ought to have done long ago come to make our acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre smiled and offered lord deepmere her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very extraordinary said this noble laggard but this is the first time that i have ever been in paris for more than three or four weeks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and how long have you been here now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh for the last two months said lord deepmere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these two remarks might have constituted an impertinence but a glance at lord deepmeres face would have satisfied you as it apparently satisfied madame de cintre that they constituted only a naivete <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when his companions were seated newman who was out of the conversation occupied himself with observing the newcomer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> observation however as regards lord deepmeres person had no great range <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was a small meagre man of some three and thirty years of age with a bald head a short nose and no front teeth in the upper jaw he had round candid blue eyes and several pimples on his chin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was evidently very shy and he laughed a great deal catching his breath with an odd startling sound as the most convenient imitation of repose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his physiognomy denoted great simplicity a certain amount of brutality and probable failure in the past to profit by rare educational advantages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he remarked that paris was awfully jolly but that for real thoroughpaced entertainment it was nothing to dublin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had madame de cintre ever been to dublin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they must all come over there some day and he would show them some irish sport <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he always went to ireland for the fishing and he came to paris for the new offenbach things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they always brought them out in dublin but he couldnt wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been nine times to hear la pomme de paris <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de cintre leaning back with her arms folded looked at lord deepmere with a more visibly puzzled face than she usually showed to society <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de bellegarde on the other hand wore a fixed smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis said that among light operas his favorite was the gazza ladra <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquise then began a series of inquiries about the duke and the cardinal the old countess and lady barbara after listening to which and to lord deepmeres somewhat irreverent responses for a quarter of an hour newman rose to take his leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marquis went with him three steps into the hall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> asked newman nodding in the direction of the visitor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mother was the daughter of lord finucane said the marquis he has great irish estates <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lady bridget in the complete absence of male heirs either direct or collateral a most extraordinary circumstancecame in for everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lord deepmeres title is english and his english property is immense <end> <end> 
<start> <start> newman answered nothing but he detained the marquis as the latter was beginning gracefully to recede <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a good time for me to thank you he said for sticking so punctiliously to our bargain for doing so much to help me on with your sister <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really i have done nothing that i can boast of he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant flatter myself that i am doing so well simply by my own merit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next time newman came to the rue de luniversite he had the good fortune to find madame de cintre alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had come with a definite intention and he lost no time in executing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wore moreover a look which he eagerly interpreted as expectancy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been coming to see you for six months now he said and i have never spoken to you a second time of marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that was what you asked me i obeyed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have acted with great delicacy said madame de cintre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well im going to change now said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont mean that i am going to be indelicate but im going to go back to where i began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or rather i have never been away from here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never ceased to want what i wanted then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only now i am more sure of it if possible i am more sure of myself and more sure of you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know you better though i dont know anything i didnt believe three months ago <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are everythingyou are beyond everything i can imagine or desire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you know me now you must know me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wont say that you have seen the bestbut you have seen the worst <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i hope you have been thinking all this while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must have seen that i was only waiting you cant suppose that i was changing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> say that everything is clear and reasonable and that i have been very patient and considerate and deserve my reward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew you were only waiting she said and i was very sure this day would come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have thought about it a great deal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first i was half afraid of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am not afraid of it now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused a moment and then she added its a relief <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was sitting on a low chair and newman was on an ottoman near her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he leaned a little and took her hand which for an instant she let him keep <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that means that i have not waited for nothing he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked at him for a moment and he saw her eyes fill with tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with me he went on you will be as safeas safeand even in his ardor he hesitated a moment for a comparisonas safe he said with a kind of simple solemnity as in your fathers arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still she looked at him and her tears increased <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then abruptly she buried her face on the cushioned arm of the sofa beside her chair and broke into noiseless sobs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am weaki am weak he heard her say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the more reason why you should give yourself up to me he answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to you everything seems so simple she said raising her head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i liked you six months ago and now i am sure of it as you say you are sure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it is not easy simply for that to decide to marry you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are a great many things to think about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there ought to be only one thing to think aboutthat we love each other said newman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as she remained silent he quickly added very good if you cant accept that dont tell me so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am very safe i dont repeat things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he hoped felix would not risk too much <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it s odd to hear you telling me how to be happy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think you know yourself dear uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man was silent a moment and then with a dry dignity that suddenly touched his nephew we may sometimes point out a road we are unable to follow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah dont tell me you have had any sorrows felix rejoined <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did nt suppose it and i did nt mean to allude to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i simply meant that you all dont amuse yourselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was saying that the other day to gertrude felix added <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth with a keener irony than felix would have thought him capable of it was but your way of amusing yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am afraid you have never had a trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix declared with some spirit before i knew better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but you dont catch me at it again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wentworth maintained for a while a silence more expressive than a deepdrawn sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have no children he said at last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont tell me felix exclaimed that your charming young people are a source of grief to you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next time he gave felix a sitting his nephew reminded him that he had taken him into his confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has always seemed to me a young man of remarkable discretion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed he is only too discreet he seems on his guard against me as if he thought me rather light company <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the other day he told his sister gertrude repeated it to methat i was always laughing at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i laugh it is simply from the impulse to try and inspire him with confidence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cliffords situation is no laughing matter said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very peculiar as i suppose you have guessed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ah you mean his love affair with his cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have decided not to speak of it unless we are asked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has been requested by the harvard authorities to absent himself for six months <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand will help him at least we hope so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brand certainly will not teach him any of those secrets <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was too fond of something of which he should not have been fond <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear uncle is there any doubt about its being a pleasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cest de son age as they say in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have said rather it was a vice of later life of disappointed old age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> felix glanced at his uncle with his lifted eyebrows and then of what are you speaking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of the situation in which clifford was found <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i rather suspected that from something i observed the first day i came here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i quite agree with you that it is a low taste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it s not a vice for a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hope for a good deal from mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has talked to him from the first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will talk to himi will talk to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean to marry him to his cousin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should nt think his cousin would want to marry him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have never discussed such subjects with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should think it might be time said felix <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lizzie acton is admirably pretty and if clifford is dangerous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have no reason to suppose they are engaged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> trust me clifford as i say is a charming boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lizzie acton then would not be jealous of another woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i certainly hope not said the old man with a vague sense of jealousy being an even lower vice than a love of liquor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the best thing for clifford then felix propounded is to become interested in some clever charming woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he paused in his painting and with his elbows on his knees looked with bright communicativeness at his uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i believe greatly in the influence of women <end> <end> 
<start> <start> living with women helps to make a man a gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is very true clifford has his sisters who are so charming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but there should be a different sentiment in play from the fraternal you know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has lizzie acton but she perhaps is rather immature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think i have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this golden age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be that the sun was hotter or the earth nearer the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but people unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger darwin forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as these catastrophes occur the sun will blaze with renewed energy and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whatever the reason the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well one very hot morningmy fourth i thinkas i was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where i slept and fed there happened this strange thing clambering among these heaps of masonry i found a narrow gallery whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by contrast with the brilliancy outside it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i entered it groping for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a pair of eyes luminous by reflection against the daylight without was watching me out of the darkness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then i remembered that strange terror of the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> overcoming my fear to some extent i advanced a step and spoke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will admit that my voice was harsh and illcontrolled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put out my hand and touched something soft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at once the eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i turned with my heart in my mouth and saw a queer little apelike figure its head held down in a peculiar manner running across the sunlit space behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it blundered against a block of granite staggered aside and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my impression of it is of course imperfect but i know it was a dull white and had strange large greyishred eyes also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but as i say it went too fast for me to see distinctly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot even say whether it ran on allfours or only with its forearms held very low <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after an instants pause i followed it into the second heap of ruins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could not find it at first but after a time in the profound obscurity i came upon one of those round welllike openings of which i have told you half closed by a fallen pillar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> could this thing have vanished down the shaft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i lit a match and looking down i saw a small white moving creature with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was clambering down the wall and now i saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand going out as it dropped and when i had lit another the little monster had disappeared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know how long i sat peering down that well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when they were gone gluck took a farewell look at his old friend in the melting pot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the flowing hair was all gone nothing remained but the red nose and the sparkling eyes which looked more malicious than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and no wonder thought gluck after being treated in that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he sauntered disconsolately to the window and sat himself down to catch the fresh evening air and escape the hot breath of the furnace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now this window commanded a direct view of the range of mountains which as i told you before overhung the treasure valley and more especially of the peak from which fell the golden river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was just at the close of the day and when gluck sat down at the window he saw the rocks of the mountain tops all crimson and purple with the sunset and there were bright tongues of fiery cloud burning and quivering about them and the river brighter than all fell in a waving column of pure gold from precipice to precipice with the double arch of a broad purple rainbow stretched across it flushing and fading alternately in the wreaths of spray <end> <end> 
<start> <start> k in the same wynd and at last in the same building with the dissectingrooms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here after a night of turbulent pleasures his hand still tottering his sight still misty and confused he would be called out of bed in the black hours before the winter dawn by the unclean and desperate interlopers who supplied the table <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would open the door to these men since infamous throughout the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would help them with their tragic burden pay them their sordid price and remain alone when they were gone with the unfriendly relics of humanity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from such a scene he would return to snatch another hour or two of slumber to repair the abuses of the night and refresh himself for the labours of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> few lads could have been more insensible to the impressions of a life thus passed among the ensigns of mortality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his mind was closed against all general considerations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was incapable of interest in the fate and fortunes of another the slave of his own desires and low ambitions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cold light and selfish in the last resort he had that modicum of prudence miscalled morality which keeps a man from inconvenient drunkenness or punishable theft <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he coveted besides a measure of consideration from his masters and his fellowpupils and he had no desire to fail conspicuously in the external parts of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus he made it his pleasure to gain some distinction in his studies and day after day rendered unimpeachable eyeservice to his employer mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for his day of work he indemnified himself by nights of roaring blackguardly enjoyment and when that balance had been struck the organ that he called his conscience declared itself content <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the supply of subjects was a continual trouble to him as well as to his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that large and busy class the raw material of the anatomists kept perpetually running out and the business thus rendered necessary was not only unpleasant in itself but threatened dangerous consequences to all who were concerned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> k to ask no questions in his dealings with the trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they bring the body and we pay the price he used to say dwelling on the alliteration quid pro quo <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and again and somewhat profanely ask no questions he would tell his assistants for conscience sake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was no understanding that the subjects were provided by the crime of murder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had that idea been broached to him in words he would have recoiled in horror but the lightness of his speech upon so grave a matter was in itself an offence against good manners and a temptation to the men with whom he dealt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fettes for instance had often remarked to himself upon the singular freshness of the bodies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been struck again and again by the hangdog abominable looks of the ruffians who came to him before the dawn and putting things together clearly in his private thoughts he perhaps attributed a meaning too immoral and too categorical to the unguarded counsels of his master <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he understood his duty in short to have three branches to take what was brought to pay the price and to avert the eye from any evidence of crime <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one november morning this policy of silence was put sharply to the test <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had been awake all night with a racking toothache pacing his room like a caged beast or throwing himself in fury on his bed and had fallen at last into that profound uneasy slumber that so often follows on a night of pain when he was awakened by the third or fourth angry repetition of the concerted signal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a thin bright moonshine it was bitter cold windy and frosty the town had not yet awakened but an indefinable stir already preluded the noise and business of the day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the ghouls had come later than usual and they seemed more than usually eager to be gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he heard their grumbling irish voices through a dream and as they stripped the sack from their sad merchandise he leaned dozing with his shoulder propped against the wall he had to shake himself to find the men their money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he did so his eyes lighted on the dead face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he started he took two steps nearer with the candle raised <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the men answered nothing but they shuffled nearer the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i know her i tell you he continued <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its impossible she can be dead its sure sir youre mistaken entirely said one of the men <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the other looked fettes darkly in the eyes and demanded the money on the spot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was impossible to misconceive the threat or to exaggerate the danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he stammered some excuses counted out the sum and saw his hateful visitors depart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner were they gone than he hastened to confirm his doubts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by a dozen unquestionable marks he identified the girl he had jested with the day before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw with horror marks upon her body that might well betoken violence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a panic seized him and he took refuge in his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there he reflected at length over the discovery that he had made considered soberly the bearing of mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ks instructions and the danger to himself of interference in so serious a business and at last in sore perplexity determined to wait for the advice of his immediate superior the class assistant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a young doctor wolfe macfarlane a high favourite among all the reckless students clever dissipated and unscrupulous to the last degree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his manners were agreeable and a little forward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was an authority on the stage skilful on the ice or the links with skate or golfclub he dressed with nice audacity and to put the finishing touch upon his glory he kept a gig and a strong trottinghorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> only two or three at most the young man returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they read me but that doesnt make me like them any better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he led the way out of the exhibition <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes going to take me to the park miss fancourt observed to overt with elation as they passed along the corridor that led to the street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paul asked taking the fact for a somewhat unexpected illustration of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a beautiful day therell be a great crowd <end> <end> 
<start> <start> were going to look at the people to look at types the girl went on <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we shall sit under the trees we shall walk by the row <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go once a year on business said st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> or with a country cousin didnt you tell me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued over her shoulder to paul as their friend drew her toward a hansom to which he had signalled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the young man watched them get in he returned as he stood there the friendly wave of the hand with which ensconced in the vehicle beside her st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he even lingered to see the vehicle start away and lose itself in the confusion of bond street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he followed it with his eyes it put to him embarrassing things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the great novelist had said emphatically at summersoft but his manner of conducting himself toward her appeared not quite in harmony with such a conviction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how could he have behaved differently if she had been for him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an indefinite envy rose in paul overts heart as he took his way on foot alone a feeling addressed alike strangely enough to each of the occupants of the hansom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much he should like to rattle about london with such a girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how much he should like to go and look at types with st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next sunday at four oclock he called in manchester square where his secret wish was gratified by his finding miss fancourt alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for several minutes no one spoke i think they must each have been as overcome by awe as was i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all about us was a flora and fauna as strange and wonderful to us as might have been those upon a distant planet had we suddenly been miraculously transported through ether to an unknown world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the grass upon the nearer bank was unearthlylush and high it grew and each blade bore upon its tip a brilliant flower violet or yellow or carmine or bluemaking as gorgeous a sward as human imagination might conceive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tall fernlike trees were alive with monkeys snakes and lizards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> huge insects hummed and buzzed hither and thither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mighty forms could be seen moving upon the ground in the thick forest while the bosom of the river wriggled with living things and above flapped the wings of gigantic creatures such as we are taught have been extinct throughout countless ages <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would you look at the giraffe comin up out o the bottom of the say <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we looked in the direction he pointed and saw a long glossy neck surmounted by a small head rising above the surface of the river <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the back of the creature was exposed brown and glossy as the water dripped from it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it turned its eyes upon us opened its lizardlike mouth emitted a shrill hiss and came for us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing must have been sixteen or eighteen feet in length and closely resembled pictures i had seen of restored plesiosaurs of the lower jurassic <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it charged us as savagely as a mad bull and one would have thought it intended to destroy and devour the mighty uboat as i verily believe it did intend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were moving slowly up the river as the creature bore down upon us with distended jaws <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the long neck was far outstretched and the four flippers with which it swam were working with powerful strokes carrying it forward at a rapid pace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when it reached the crafts side the jaws closed upon one of the stanchions of the deck rail and tore it from its socket as though it had been a toothpick stuck in putty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at this exhibition of titanic strength i think we all simultaneously stepped backward and bradley drew his revolver and fired <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the bullet struck the thing in the neck just above its body but instead of disabling it merely increased its rage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its hissing rose to a shrill scream as it raised half its body out of water onto the sloping sides of the hull of the u and endeavored to scramble upon the deck to devour us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dozen shots rang out as we who were armed drew our pistols and fired at the thing but though struck several times it showed no signs of succumbing and only floundered farther aboard the submarine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had noticed that the girl had come on deck and was standing not far behind me and when i saw the danger to which we were all exposed i turned and forced her toward the hatch <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we had not spoken for some days and we did not speak now but she gave me a disdainful look which was quite as eloquent as words and broke loose from my grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw i could do nothing with her unless i exerted force and so i turned with my back toward her that i might be in a position to shield her from the strange reptile should it really succeed in reaching the deck and as i did so i saw the thing raise one flipper over the rail dart its head forward and with the quickness of lightning seize upon one of the boches <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ran forward discharging my pistol into the creatures body in an effort to force it to relinquish its prey but i might as profitably have shot at the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shrieking and screaming the german was dragged from the deck and the moment the reptile was clear of the boat it dived beneath the surface of the water with its terrified prey <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think we were all more or less shaken by the frightfulness o the tragedyuntil olson remarked that the balance of power now rested where it belonged <end> <end> 
<start> <start> following the death of benson we had been nine and ninenine germans and nine allies as we called ourselves now there were but eight germans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a picture of the weightman wing of the hospital for cripples the weightman chair of political jurisprudence in jackson university of which he was a trustee and an illustrated account of the opening of the weightman grammarschool at dulwichonthesound where he had his legal residence for purposes of taxation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this last was perhaps the most carefully planned of all the weightman charities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he desired to win the confidence and support of his rural neighbors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waits the accustomed hour when twilightgloom obscures the closing sky then gladly seeks his loved paternal bower friendship and love his cottage guests receive him with honest welcome and with smile sincere no threatening woes of present joys bereave him no sigh his bosom owns his cheek no tear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such bliss to me denying fortune thy lot with envy bids me view me who from home and spain an exile flying bid all i value all i love adieu <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no more mine ear shall list the wellknown ditty sung by some mountaingirl who tends her goats some villageswain imploring amorous pity no more my arms a parents fond embraces no more my heart domestic calm must know far from these joys with sighs which memory traces to sultry skies and distant climes i go <end> <end> 
<start> <start> where indian suns engender new diseases where snakes and tigers breed i bend my way to brave the feverish thirst no art appeases but not to feel slow pangs consume my liver to die by piecemeal in the bloom of age my boiling blood drank by insatiate fever can make me know such grief as thus to sever with many a bitter sigh dear land from thee to feel this heart must doat on thee for ever and feel that all thy joys are torn from me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how oft will fancys spells in slumber recall my native country to my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how oft regret will bid me sadly number each lost delight and dear friend left behind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wild murcias vales and loved romantic bowers the river on whose banks a child i played my castles antient halls its frowning towers dreams of the land where all my wishes centre thy scenes which i am doomed no more to know full oft shall memory trace my souls tormentor and turn each pleasure past to present woe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun beneath the waves retires night speeds apace her empire to restore clouds from my sight obscure the villagespires now seen but faintly and now seen no more <end> <end>

<start> <start> my last petition scorning fresh blows the gale and high the billows swell far shall we be before the break of morning oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lorenzo had scarcely time to read these lines when elvira returned to him the giving a free course to her tears had relieved her and her spirits had regained their usual composure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have nothing more to say my lord said she you have heard my apprehensions and my reasons for begging you not to repeat your visits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have thrown myself in full confidence upon your honour i am certain that you will not prove my opinion of you but one question more segnora and i leave you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should the duke of medina approve my love would my addresses be i will be open with you don lorenzo there being little probability of such an union taking place i fear that it is desired but too ardently by my daughter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you have made an impression upon her young heart which gives me the most serious alarm to prevent that impression from growing stronger i am obliged to decline your acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for me you may be sure that i should rejoice at establishing my child so advantageously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> conscious that my constitution impaired by grief and illness forbids me to expect a long continuance in this world i tremble at the thought of leaving her under the protection of a perfect he will marry his lady may look upon antonia with an eye of displeasure and deprive her of her only friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> should the duke your uncle give his consent you need not doubt obtaining mine and my daughters but without his hope not for ours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at all events what ever steps you may take what ever may be the dukes decision till you know it let me beg your forbearing to strengthen by your presence antonias prepossession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if the sanction of your relations authorises your addressing her as your wife my doors fly open to you if that sanction is refused be satisfied to possess my esteem and gratitude but remember that lorenzo promised reluctantly to conform to this decree but he added that he hoped soon to obtain that consent which would give him a claim to the renewal of their acquaintance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then explained to her why the marquis had not called in person and made no scruple of confiding to her his sisters history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he concluded by saying that he hoped to set agnes at liberty the next day and that as soon as don raymonds fears were quieted upon this subject he would lose no time in assuring donna elvira of his friendship and protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tremble for your sister said she i have heard many traits of the domina of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clares character from a friend who was educated in the same convent with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she reported her to be haughty inflexible superstitious and revengeful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have since heard that she is infatuated with the idea of rendering her convent the most regular in madrid and never forgave those whose imprudence threw upon it the slightest stain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though naturally violent and severe when her interests require it she well knows how to assume an appearance of benignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she leaves no means untried to persuade young women of rank to become members of her community she is implacable when once incensed and has too much intrepidity to shrink at taking the most rigorous measures for punishing the offender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doubtless she will consider your sisters quitting the convent as a disgrace thrown upon it she will use every artifice to avoid obeying the mandate of his holiness and i shudder to think that donna agnes is in the lorenzo now rose to take leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> elvira gave him her hand at parting which he kissed respectfully and telling her that he soon hoped for the permission to salute that of antonia he returned to his hotel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady was perfectly satisfied with the conversation which had past between them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she looked forward with satisfaction to the prospect of his becoming her sonin law but prudence bad her conceal from her daughters knowledge the flattering hopes which herself now ventured to entertain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scarcely was it day and already lorenzo was at the convent of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he waited impatiently for the conclusion of the service and at length the prioress appeared at the parlour grate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old lady replied with a melancholy air that the dear childs situation grew hourly more dangerous that the physicians despaired of her life but that they had declared the only chance for her recovery to consist in keeping her quiet and not to permit those to approach her whose presence was likely to agitate her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not a word of all this was believed by lorenzo any more than he credited the expressions of grief and affection for agnes with which this account was interlarded <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to end the business he put the popes bull into the hands of the domina and insisted that ill or in health his sister should be delivered to him without delay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prioress received the paper with an air of humility but no sooner had her eye glanced over the contents than her resentment baffled all the efforts of hypocrisy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a deep crimson spread itself over her face and she darted upon lorenzo looks of rage and menace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this order is positive said she in a voice of anger which she in vain strove to disguise willingly would i obey it but lorenzo interrupted her by an exclamation of surprize <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i repeat it segnor to obey this order is totally out of my power <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from tenderness to a brothers feelings i would have communicated the sad event to you by degrees and have prepared you to hear it with fortitude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my measures are broken through this order commands me to deliver up to you the sister agnes without delay i am therefore obliged to inform you without lorenzo started back with horror and turned pale <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moments recollection convinced him that this assertion must be false and it restored him to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he passionately but five minutes past since you assured me that though ill she was still alive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> see her i must and will and every you forget yourself segnor you owe respect to my age as well as my profession <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i at first concealed her death it was from dreading lest an event so unexpected should produce on you too violent an effect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in truth i am but ill repaid for my attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what interest i pray you should i have in detaining her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to know her wish of quitting our society is a sufficient reason for me to wish her absence and think her a disgrace to the sisterhood of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clare but she has forfeited my affection in a manner yet more culpable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her crimes were great and when you know the cause of her death you will doubtless rejoice don lorenzo that such a wretch is no longer in existence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was taken ill on thursday last on returning from confession in the capuchin chapel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her malady seemed attended with strange circumstances but she persisted in concealing its cause thanks to the virgin we were too ignorant to suspect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> judge then what must have been our consternation our horror when she was delivered the next day of a stillborn child whom she immediately followed to the grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it possible that your countenance expresses no surprize no indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it possible that your sisters infamy was known to you and that still she possessed your affection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that case you have no need of my compassion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can say nothing more except repeat my inability of obeying the orders of his holiness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> agnes is no more and to convince you that what i say is true i swear by our blessed saviour that here she kissed a small crucifix which hung at her girdle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she then rose from her chair and quitted the parlour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as she withdrew she cast upon lorenzo a scornful smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> farewell segnor said she i know no remedy for this accident i fear that even a second bull from the pope will not lorenzo also retired penetrated with affliction but don raymonds at the news of this event amounted to madness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would not be convinced that agnes was really dead and continued to insist that the walls of st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no arguments could make him abandon his hopes of regaining her every day some fresh scheme was invented for procuring intelligence of her and all of them were attended with the same success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on his part medina gave up the idea of ever seeing his sister more yet he believed that she had been taken off by unfair means <end> <end> 
<start> <start> under this persuasion he encouraged don raymonds researches determined should he discover the least warrant for his suspicions to take a severe vengeance upon the unfeeling prioress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the loss of his sister affected him sincerely nor was it the least cause of his distress that propriety obliged him for some time to defer mentioning antonia to the duke <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meanwhile his emissaries constantly surrounded elviras door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had intelligence of all the movements of his mistress as she never failed every thursday to attend the sermon in the capuchin cathedral he was secure of seeing her once a week though in compliance with his promise he carefully shunned her observation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still no information was procured of agnes all but the marquis credited her death and now lorenzo determined to disclose his sentiments to his uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had already dropt some hints of his intention to marry they had been as favourably received as he could expect and he harboured no doubt of the success of his while in each others arms entranced they lay they blessed the night and curst the coming day <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the burst of transport was past ambrosios lust was satisfied pleasure fled and shame usurped her seat in his bosom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> confused and terrified at his weakness he drew himself from matildas arms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his perjury presented itself before him he reflected on the scene which had just been acted and trembled at the consequences of a discovery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he looked forward with horror his heart was despondent and became the abode of satiety and disgust <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he avoided the eyes of his partner in frailty a melancholy silence prevailed during which both seemed busied with disagreable reflections <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a persistently unlucky man is perhaps sometimes to be pitied but more often to be booted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that philosophy will be cryingly unjust about once in ten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but lucky or unlucky the tenderfoot is human <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a malevolent engine of destructionquite as impersonal as heat or cold or lack of water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is an unfortunate article of personal belonging requiring much looking after to keep in order <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a credulous and convenient response to practical jokes huge tales misinformation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is a laudable object of attrition for the development of your character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but somehow in the woods he is not as other men and so you do not come to feel yourself in close human relations to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has feelings even if you do not respect them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has his little enjoyments even though he does rarely contemplate anything but the horn of his saddle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> algernon you cry for heavens sake stick that saddle of yours in a glass case and glut yourself with the sight of its ravishing beauties next winter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the present do gaze on the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has doubtless a full range of all the appreciative emotions though from his actions youd never suspect it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> most human of all he possesses his little vanities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it is birdshooting he accumulates leggings and canvas caps and belts and dogwhistles and things until he looks like a picture from a departmentstore catalogue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the cow country he wears stetson hats snake bands red handkerchiefs sixshooters chaps and huge spurs that do not match his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if it is yachting he has a chronometer with a gong in the cabin of a fiveton sailboat possesses a nickleplated machine to register the heel of his craft sports a brassbound yachtingcap and all the regalia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i never could understand his insane desire to get sunburned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man will get sunburned fast enough he could not help it if he would <end> <end> 
<start> <start> algernon usually starts out from town without a hat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he dares not take off his sweater for a week lest it carry away his entire face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have seen men with deep sores on their shoulders caused by nothing but excessive burning in the sun <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it means quite simply that algernon realizes his inner deficiencies and wants to make up for them by the outward seeming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> be kind to him for he has been raised a pet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the tenderfoot is lovablemysterious in how he does itand awfully unexpected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one day we tied our horses to three bushes and walked on foot two hundred yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a river meandering through olivecolored forests <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was so distant that it was light green and as narrow as a piece of tape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here and there were rapids but so remote that we could not distinguish the motion of them only the color <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the white resembled tiny dabs of cotton wool stuck on the tape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it turned and twisted following the turns and twists of the canon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somehow the level at the bottom resembled less forests and meadows than a heavy and sluggish fluid like molasses flowing between the canon walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it emerged from the bend of a sheer cliff ten miles to eastward it disappeared placidly around the bend of another sheer cliff an equal distance to the westward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we watched the shadow of the canon wall darkened the valley <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now the upper air of which we were dwellers for the moment was peopled by giants and clear atmosphere and glittering sunlight flashing like silver and steel and precious stones from the granite domes peaks minarets and palisades of the high sierras <end> <end> 
<start> <start> solid as they were in reality in the crispness of this mountain air under the tangible blue of this mountain sky they seemed to poise light as so many balloons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> some of them rose sheer with hardly a fissure some had flung across their shoulders long trailing pine draperies fine as fur others matched mantles of the whitest white against the bluest blue of the sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> towards the lower country were more pines rising in ridges like the fur of an animal that has been alarmed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we dangled our feet over the edge and talked about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wes pointed to the upper end where the sluggish lavalike flow of the canonbed first came into view <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for this canon lies in the heart of the mountains <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those who would visit it have first to get into the countrya matter of over a week <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they have their choice of three probabilities of destruction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man was too far away for her to recognize his features but his size and bearing and general appearance appealed to the lonesome maggie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hoped it was someone she knew or with whom she might easily become acquainted for maggie was bored to death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she patted the hair at the back of her head and righted the mop which hung over one eye <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the man approached she saw that he was better looking than she had even dared to hope and that there was something extremely familiar about his appearance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not though until he was almost in front of the house that he looked up at the girl and she recognized him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then maggie shane gasped and clutched the handrail at her side <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an instant later the man was past and continuing his way along the sidewalk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maggie shane glared after him for a minute then she ran quickly down the stairs and into a grocery store a few doors west where she asked if she might use the telephone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gimme west she demanded of the operator and a moment later is this lake street <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes an never mind who i am but if youse guys want him hes walkin west on grand avenoo right now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i just this minute seen him near lincoln and she smashed the receiver back into its hook <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne thought that he would look in on his mother not that he expected to be welcomed even though she might happen to be sober or not that he cared to see her but billys whole manner of thought had altered within the year and something now seemed to tell him that it was his duty to do the thing he contemplated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> maybe he might even be of help to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but when he reached the gloomy neighborhood in which his childhood had been spent it was to learn that his mother was dead and that another family occupied the tumbledown cottage that had been his home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if billy byrne felt any sorrow because of his mothers death he did not reveal it outwardly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he owed her nothing but for kicks and cuffs received and for the surroundings and influences that had started him upon a life of crime at an age when most boys are just entering grammar school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> really the man was relieved that he had not had to see her and it was with a lighter step that he turned back to retrace his way along grand avenue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one of the few he had met who recognized him had seemed particularly delighted at his return <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the whole affair had been something of a disappointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore billy determined to go at once to the lake street station and learn the status of the schneider murder case <end> <end> 
<start> <start> possibly they had discovered the real murderer and if that was the case billy would be permitted to go his way but if not then he could give himself up and ask for a trial that he might be exonerated <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he neared wood street two men who had been watching his approach stepped into the doorway of a saloon and as he passed they stepped out again behind him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come easy now byrne admonished one of the men an dont make no fuss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i was just goin over to the station to give myself up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well just save you the trouble said one of them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you might lose your way if you tried to go alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy went along in silence the rest of the way to where the patrol waited at another corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw there was nothing to be gained by talking to these detectives but he found the lieutenant equally inclined to doubt his intentions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he too only laughed when billy assured him that he was on his way to the station at the very instant of arrest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as the weeks dragged along and billy byrne found no friendly interest in himself or his desire to live on the square and no belief in his protestations that he had had naught to do with the killing of schneider he began to have his doubts as to the wisdom of his act <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he also commenced to entertain some of his former opinions of the police and of the law of which they are supposed to be the guardians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a cellmate told him that the papers had scored the department heavily for their failure to apprehend the murderer of the inoffensive old schneider and that public opinion had been so aroused that a general police shakeup had followed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the result was that the police were keen to fasten the guilt upon someonethey did not care whom so long as it was someone who was in their custody <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you may not o done it ventured the cellmate but theyll send you up for it if they cant hang you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyre goin to try to get the death sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they haint got no love for you byrne <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you caused em a lot o throuble in your day an they havent forgot it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seemed to have faded back into the old distrust and hatred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he shook himself and conjured in his mind the vision of a beautiful girl who had believed in him and trusted him who had inculcated within him a love for all that was finest and best in true manhood for the very things that he had most hated all the years of his life before she had come into his existence to alter it and him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then billy would believe againbelieve that in the end justice would triumph and that it would all come out right just the way he had pictured it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with the coming of the last day of the trial billy found it more and more difficult to adhere to his regard for law order and justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the prosecution had shown conclusively that billy was a hard customer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the police had brought witnesses who did not hesitate to perjure themselves in their testimony testimony which it seemed to billy the densest of jurymen could plainly see had been framed up and learned by rote until it was letterperfect <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these witnesses could recall with startling accuracy every detail that had occurred between seventeen minutes after eight and twentyone minutes past nine on the night of september over a year before but where they had been and what they had done ten minutes earlier or ten minutes later or where they were at nine oclock in the evening last friday they couldnt for the lives of them remember <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even billy had to admit it and when the prosecuting attorney demanded the death penalty the prisoner had an uncanny sensation as of the tightening of a hempen rope about his neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he waited for the jury to return its verdict billy sat in his cell trying to read a newspaper which a kindly guard had given him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but his eyes persisted in boring through the white paper and the black type to scenes that were not in any paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw a turbulent river tumbling through a savage world and in the swirl of the water lay a little island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he saw a man there upon the island and a girl <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the girl was teaching the man to speak the language of the cultured and to view life as people of refinement view it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she taught him what honor meant among her class and that it was better to lose any other possession rather than lose honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy realized that it had been these lessons that had spurred him on to the mad scheme that was to end now with the verdict of guiltyhe had wished to vindicate his honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a hard laugh broke from his lips but instantly he sobered and his face softened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it had been for her sake after all and what mattered it if they did send him to the gallows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had not sacrificed his honorhe had done his best to assert it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could kill him but they couldnt make him guilty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a thousand juries pronouncing him so could not make it true that he had killed schneider <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it would be hard after all his hopes after all the plans he had made to live square to show them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his eyes still boring through the paper suddenly found themselves attracted by something in the text before thema name harding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the marriage of barbara daughter of anthony harding the multimillionaire to william mallory will take place on the twentyfifth of june <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was more but billy did not read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is true that he had urged her to marry mallory but now in his lonesomeness and friendlessness he felt almost as though she had been untrue to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come along byrne a bailiff interrupted his thoughts the jurys reached a verdict <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the judge was emerging from his chambers as billy was led into the courtroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently the jury filed in and took their seats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foreman handed the clerk a bit of paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even before it was read billy knew that he had been found guilty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not care any longer so he told himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he hoped that the judge would send him to the gallows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing more in life for him now anyway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but instead he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the penitentiary at joliet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy byrne was appalled at the thought of remaining for life within the grim stone walls of a prison <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once more there swept over him all the old unreasoning hatred of the law and all that pertained to it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would like to close his steel fingers about the fat neck of the redfaced judge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the smug jurymen roused within him the lust to kill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of the jurymen leaned close to a neighbor and whispered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> society will be safer when he is behind the bars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the next day they took billy aboard a train bound for joliet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> billy was calm outwardly but inwardly he was a raging volcano of hate <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a certain very beautiful home on riverside drive new york city a young lady comfortably backed by downy pillows sat in her bed and alternated her attention between coffee and rolls and a morning paper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the inside of the main sheet a heading claimed her languid attention chicago murderer given life sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of late chicago had aroused in barbara harding a greater proportion of interest than ever it had in the past and so it was that she now permitted her eyes to wander casually down the printed column <end> <end> 
<start> <start> murderer of harmless old saloon keeper is finally brought to justice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the notorious west side rowdy billy byrne apprehended after more than a year as fugitive from justice is sent to joliet for life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> barbara harding sat stonyeyed and cold for what seemed many minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then with a stifled sob she turned and buried her face in the pillows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train bearing billy byrne and the deputy sheriff toward joliet had covered perhaps half the distance between chicago and billys permanent destination when it occurred to the deputy sheriff that he should like to go into the smoker and enjoy a cigar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now from the moment that he had been sentenced billy byrnes mind had been centered upon one thoughtescape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew that there probably would be not the slightest chance for escape but nevertheless the idea was always uppermost in his thoughts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his whole being revolted not alone against the injustice which had sent him into life imprisonment but at the thought of the long years of awful monotony which lay ahead of him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the deputy sheriff rose and motioning his prisoner ahead of him started for the smoker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first platform they crossed was tightly enclosed but at the second billy saw that a careless porter had left one of the doors open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the train was slowing down for some reasonit was going perhaps twenty miles an hour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was the first to see the open door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it meant one of two thingsa chance to escape or death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even the latter was to be preferred to life imprisonment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even before the deputy sheriff realized that the door was open his prisoner had leaped from the moving train dragging his guard after him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> byrne had no time to pick any particular spot to jump for <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he did jump he might have been directly over a picket fence or a bottomless pithe did not know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the platform chanced to be passing across a culvert at the instant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if these can be obtained all is well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if not and if the inhabitants prove as inhospitable as polyphemus or the laestrygons then there will but half of us perish and the remainder may set sail and escape <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as nobody objected to this scheme ulysses proceeded to count the whole band and found that there were fortysix men including himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he then numbered off twentytwo of them and put eurylochus who was one of his chief officers and second only to himself in sagacity at their head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ulysses took command of the remaining twentytwo men in person <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then taking off his helmet he put two shells into it on one of which was written go and on the other stay <end> <end> 
<start> <start> another person now held the helmet while ulysses and eurylochus drew out each a shell and the word go was found written on that which eurylochus had drawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this manner it was decided that ulysses and his twentytwo men were to remain at the seaside until the other party should have found out what sort of treatment they might expect at the mysterious palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as there was no help for it eurylochus immediately set forth at the head of his twentytwo followers who went off in a very melancholy state of mind leaving their friends in hardly better spirits than themselves <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no sooner had they clambered up the cliff than they discerned the tall marble towers of the palace ascending as white as snow out of the lovely green shadow of the trees which surrounded it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a gush of smoke came from a chimney in the rear of the edifice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this vapor rose high in the air and meeting with a breeze was wafted seaward and made to pass over the heads of the hungry mariners <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when peoples appetites are keen they have a very quick scent for anything savory in the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried one of them turning up his nose as high as he could and snuffing eagerly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as sure as im a halfstarved vagabond i smell roast meat in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> let us make haste cried the others or we shall be too late for the good cheer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but scarcely had they made half a dozen steps from the edge of the cliff when a bird came fluttering to meet them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the same pretty little bird with the purple wings and body the yellow legs the golden collar round its neck and the crownlike tuft upon its head whose behavior had so much surprised ulysses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it hovered about eurylochus and almost brushed his face with its wings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so plaintively intelligent was the sound that it seemed as if the little creature were going to break its heart with some mighty secret that it had to tell and only this one poor note to tell it with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my pretty bird said eurylochusfor he was a wary person and let no token of harm escape his noticemy pretty bird who sent you hither <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and what is the message which you bring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then it flew towards the edge of the cliff and looked around at them as if exceedingly anxious that they should return whence they came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eurylochus and a few of the others were inclined to turn back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they could not help suspecting that the purple bird must be aware of something mischievous that would befall them at the palace and the knowledge of which affected its airy spirit with a human sympathy and sorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the rest of the voyagers snuffing up the smoke from the palace kitchen ridiculed the idea of returning to the vessel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of them more brutal than his fellows and the most notorious gormandizer in the crew said such a cruel and wicked thing that i wonder the mere thought did not turn him into a wild beast in shape as he already was in his nature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this troublesome and impertinent little fowl said he would make a delicate titbit to begin dinner with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just one plump morsel melting away between the teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he comes within my reach ill catch him and give him to the palace cook to be roasted on a skewer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the words were hardly out of his mouth before the purple bird flew away crying peep peep peweep more dolorously than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that bird remarked eurylochus knows more than we do about what awaits us at the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on then cried his comrades and well soon know as much as he does <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the party accordingly went onward through the green and pleasant wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> every little while they caught new glimpses of the marble palace which looked more and more beautiful the nearer they approached it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they soon entered a broad pathway which seemed to be very neatly kept and which went winding along with streaks of sunshine falling across it and specks of light quivering among the deepest shadows that fell from the lofty trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was bordered too with a great many sweetsmelling flowers such as the mariners had never seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so rich and beautiful they were that if the shrubs grew wild here and were native in the soil then this island was surely the flower garden of the whole earth or if transplanted from some other clime it must have been from the happy islands that lay towards the golden sunset <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there has been a great deal of pains foolishly wasted on these flowers observed one of the company and i tell you what he said that you may keep in mind what gormandizers they were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for my part if i were the owner of the palace i would bid my gardener cultivate nothing but savory pot herbs to make a stuffing for roast meat or to flavor a stew with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but ill warrant you theres a kitchen garden in the rear of the palace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at one place they came to a crystal spring and paused to drink at it for want of liquor which they liked better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking into its bosom they beheld their own faces dimly reflected but so extravagantly distorted by the gush and motion of the water that each one of them appeared to be laughing at himself and all his companions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so ridiculous were these images of themselves indeed that they did really laugh aloud and could hardly be grave again as soon as they wished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and after they had drank they grew still merrier than before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is far from the copan but you are near an indian village and you will be able to get help in a week or so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meanwhile you will not starve as you have plenty of supplies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you will travel northeast you will come again to puerto cortes in due season <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as for the money i had from you i deposit it to your credit professor beecher having made me an allowance for steering rival parties on the wrong trail <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i lose nothing and i save my honor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i write this note as i am leaving in the night with the indians <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i put some harmless sedative in your tea that you might sleep soundly and not awaken until we were well on our way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do not try to follow us as the river will carry us swiftly away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and let me add there is no personal animosity on the part of professor beecher against you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i should have done to any rival expedition the same as i have done with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a moment there was silence and then tom well of all the mean contemptible tricks of a human skunk this is the limit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bless my hairbrush but he is a scoundrel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> id like to start after him the biggest alligator in the river was neds comment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a strange look on his face and then he laughed shortly as though the humor of the situation appealed to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> professor beecher has more gumption than i gave him credit for he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant exactly agree that it was the right thing to do but he or some friend acting for him seems to have taken precautions that we are not to suffer or lose money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beecher goes on the theory that all is fair in love and war i suppose and he may call this a sort of scientific war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ned wondered as he looked at his chum how much love there was in it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> clearly beecher was determined to get that idol of gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well it cant be helped and we must make the best of it said tom after a pause <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now boys lets have breakfast and then well make what goods we cant take with us as snug as possible until we can send the mule drivers after them went on professor bumper <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont suppose im going to let a little thing like this stand between me and the discovery of kurzon and the idol of gold do you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> damon i dont see how oh well find a way interrupted tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt the first time ive been pretty well stranded on an expedition of this kind and sometimes from the same causethe actions of a rival <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now well turn the tables on the other fellows and see how they like it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom and ned got the meal and then a consultation was held as to what was best to be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we cant go on any further by water thats sure said tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the first place the river is too shallow and secondly we have no canoes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so the only thing is to go on foot through the jungle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how can we and carry all this stuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well leave it here where it will be safe enough and tramp on to the nearest indian village <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there well hire bearers to take our stuff on until we can get mules <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when you have to do a thing its a whole lot easier to do than if you just feel as though you ought to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well pack up what we can carry and leave the rest added the scientist <end> <end> 
<start> <start> being an experienced traveler professor bumper had arranged his baggage so that it could be carried by porters if necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything could be put into small packages including the tents and food supply <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are four of us remarked tom and if we can not pack enough along with us to enable us to get to the nearest village we had better go back to civilization <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we went across the evening fields in silence towards a sky of deepening gold and purple and effie was close beside me always very close glancing up ever and again at my face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> certainly she knew i grieved for marion that ours was now no joyful reunion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she showed no resentment and no jealousy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> never once in all our time together did she say an adverse word of marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she set herself presently to dispel the shadow that brooded over me with the same instinctive skill that some women will show with the trouble of a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she made herself my glad and pretty slave and handmaid she forced me at last to rejoice in her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet at the back of it all marion remained stupid and tearful and infinitely distressful so that i was almost intolerably unhappy for herfor her and the dead body of my married love <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is all as i tell it now unaccountable to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i go back into these remote parts these rarely visited uplands and lonely tares of memory and it seems to me still a strange country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had thought i might be going to some sensuous paradise with effie but desire which fills the universe before its satisfaction vanishes utterly like the going of daylightwith achievement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all the facts and forms of life remain darkling and cold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an upland of melancholy questionings a region from which i saw all the world at new angles and in new aspects i had outflanked passion and romance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had come into a condition of vast perplexities <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time in my life at least so it seems to me now in this retrospect i looked at my existence as a whole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since this was nothing what was i doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was going to and fro about tonobungaythe business i had taken up to secure marion and which held me now in spite of our intimate separationand snatching odd weekends and nights for orpington and all the while i struggled with these obstinate interrogations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i used to fall into musing in the trains i became even a little inaccurate and forgetful about business things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have the clearest memory of myself sitting thoughtful in the evening sunlight on a grassy hillside that looked toward seven oaks and commanded a wide sweep of country and that i was thinking out my destiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could almost write my thought down now i believe as they came to me that afternoon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie restless little cockney that she was rustled and struggled in a hedgerow below gathering flowers discovering flowers she had never seen before <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember a letter from marion in my pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had even made some tentatives for return for a reconciliation heaven knows now how i had put it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i perceived i could never face that old inconclusive dullness of life again that stagnant disappointment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see no way of honour or fine living before me at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered if all the world was even as i urged to this by one motive and to that by another creatures of chance and impulse and unmeaning traditions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had i indeed to abide by what i had said and done and chosen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> was there nothing for me in honour but to provide for effie go back penitent to marion and keep to my trade in rubbishor find some fresh oneand so work out the residue of my days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered if my case was the case of many men whether in former ages too men had been so guideless so uncharted so haphazard in their journey into life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the middle ages in the old catholic days one went to a priest and he said with all the finality of natural law this you are and this you must do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wondered whether even in the middle ages i should have accepted that ruling without question <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i remember too very distinctly how effie came and sat beside me on a little box that was before the casement window of our room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i smiled and remained head on hand looking out of the window forgetful of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> life is a thing that hurts my dear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and i turned about and drew her to me and kissed her ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i had a very bad timei still recall <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suffered i suppose from a sort of ennui of the imagination <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i found myself without an object to hold my will together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i tried ewart and got no help from him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i regard it all now in this retrospect it seems to me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned aims i discovered myself for the first time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> before that i had seen only the world and things in it had sought them selfforgetful of all but my impulse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> now i found myself grouped with a system of appetites and satisfactions with much work to doand no desire it seemed left in me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there were moments when i thought of suicide <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at times my life appeared before me in bleak relentless light a series of ignorances crude blunderings degradation and cruelty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had what the old theologians call a conviction of sin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sought salvationnot perhaps in the formula a methodist preacher would recognise but salvation nevertheless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> men find their salvation nowadays in many ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> names and forms dont i think matter very much the real need is something that we can hold and that holds one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have known a man find that determining factor in a dryplate factory and another in writing a history of the manor <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so long as it holds one it does not matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> many men and women nowadays take up some concrete aspect of socialism or social reform <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but socialism for me has always been a little bit too human too set about with personalities and foolishness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont think im blind to the fun the surprises the jolly little coarsenesses and insufficiency of life to the humour of it as people say and to adventure but that isnt the root of the matter with me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stumble and flounder but i know that over all these merry immediate things there are other things that are great and serene very high beautiful thingsthe reality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i havent got it but its there nevertheless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a spiritual guttersnipe in love with unimaginable goddesses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive never seen the goddesses nor ever shallbut it takes all the fun out of the mudand at times i fear it takes all the kindliness too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im talking of things i cant expect the reader to understand because i dont half understand them myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is something links things for me a sunset or so a mood or so the high air something there was in marions form and colour something i find and lose in mantegnas pictures something in the lines of these boats i make <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you should see x my last and i cant explain myself i perceive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perhaps it all comes to this that i am a hard and morally limited cad with a mind beyond my merits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> naturally i resist that as a complete solution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anyhow i had a sense of inexorable need of distress and insufficiency that was unendurable and for a time this aeronautical engineering allayed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the end of this particular crisis of which i tell so badly i idealised science <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i decided that in power and knowledge lay the salvation of my life the secret that would fill my need that to these things i would give myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i emerged at last like a man who has been diving in darkness clutching at a new resolve for which he had groped desperately and long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i came into the inner office suddenly one dayit must have been just before the time of marions suit for restitutionand sat down before my uncle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes been a stupid girl george he said i partly understand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but youre quit of her now practically and theres just as good fish in the sea oh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall go amok if i dont get it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im a different sort of beast from you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i feel like a man floundering in a universe of soapsuds up and downs east and west <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must get my foot on i laughed at the consternation in his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its an old ideai thought of years ago but it came back to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe the time has come for flying to be possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stuck to that and it helped me through the worst time in my life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my uncle after some halfhearted resistance and a talk with my aunt behaved like the father of a spoilt son <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fixed up an arrangement that gave me capital to play with released me from too constant a solicitude for the newer business developmentsthis was in what i may call the later moggs period of our enterprisesand i went to work at once with grim intensity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i will tell of my soaring and flying machines in the proper place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been leaving the story of my uncle altogether too long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wanted merely to tell how it was i took to this work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i took to these experiments after i had sought something that marion in some indefinable way had seemed to promise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i toiled and forgot myself for a time and did many things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> science too has been something of an irresponsive mistress since though ive served her better than i served marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the time science with her order her inhuman distance yet steely certainties saved me from despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i have still to fly but incidentally i have invented the lightest engines in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am trying to tell of all the things that happened to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its hard enough simply to get it put down in the remotest degree right <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but this is a novel not a treatise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont imagine that i am coming presently to any sort of solution of my difficulties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here among my drawings and hammerings now i still question unanswering problems <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all my life has been at bottom seeking disbelieving always dissatisfied always with the thing seen and the thing believed seeking something in toil in force in danger something whose name and nature i do not clearly understand something beautiful worshipful enduring mine profoundly and fundamentally and the utter redemption of myself i dont knowall i can tell is that it is something i have ever failed to find <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but before i finish this chapter and book altogether and go on with the great adventure of my uncles career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i may perhaps tell what else remains to tell of marion and effie and then for a time set my private life behind me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a time marion and i corresponded with some regularity writing friendly but rather uninforming letters about small business things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she left the house at ealing and went into the country with her aunt and parents taking a small farm near lewes in sussex <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she put up glass she put in heat for her father happy man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the thing seemed to promise well throughout a spring and summer but the sussex winter after london was too much for the ramboats <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ramboat killed a cow by improper feeding and that disheartened them all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had to help her out of this and then they returned to london and she went into partnership with smithie at streatham and ran a business that was intimated on the firms stationery as robes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the parents and aunt were stowed away in a cottage somewhere <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but in one i remember a postscript that had a little stab of our nearly eight years slipped by <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i grew in experience in capacity until i was fully a man but with many new interests living on a larger scale in a wider world than i could have dreamt of in my marion days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at last came a gap of silence that made me curious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for eighteen months or more i had nothing from marion save her quarterly receipts through the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then i damned at smithie and wrote a card to marion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she astonished me tremendously by telling me she had married againa mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wachorn a leading agent in the paperpattern trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she still wrote on the ponderevo and smith robes notepaper from the ponderevo and smith address <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and that except for a little difference of opinion about the continuance of alimony which gave me some passages of anger and the use of my name by the firm which also annoyed me is the end of marions history for me and she vanishes out of this story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know where she is or what she is doing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know whether she is alive or dead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it seems to me utterly grotesque that two people who have stood so close to one another as she and i should be so separated but so it is between us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> effie too i have parted from though i still see her at times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between us there was never any intention of marriage nor intimacy of soul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had a sudden fierce hotblooded passion for me and i for her but i was not her first lover nor her last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when they will have any company of man then they draw them towards the lands marching next to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then they have loves that use them and they dwell with them an eight days or ten and then go home again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if they have any knave child they keep it a certain time and then send it to the father when he can go alone and eat by himself or else they slay it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if it be a female they do away that one pap with an hot iron <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if it be a woman of great lineage they do away the left pap that they may the better bear a shield <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if it be a woman on foot they do away the right pap for to shoot with bow turkeys for they shoot well with bows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that land they have a queen that governeth all that land and all they be obeissant to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and always they make her queen by election that is most worthy in arms for they be right good warriors and orped and wise noble and worthy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they go oftentime in solde to help of other kings in their wars for gold and silver as other soldiers do and they maintain themselves right vigourously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this land of amazonia is an isle all environed with the sea save in two places where be two entries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beyond that water dwell the men that be their paramours and their loves where they go to solace them when they will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beside amazonia is the land of tarmegyte that is a great country and a full delectable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and for the goodness of the country king alexander let first make there the city of alexandria and yet he made twelve cities of the same name but that city is now clept celsite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from that other coast of chaldea toward the south is ethiopia a great country that stretcheth to the end of egypt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ethiopia is departed in two parts principal and that is in the east part and in the meridional part the which part meridional is clept mauritania and the folk of that country be black enough and more black than in the tother part and they be clept moors <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that part is a well that in the day it is so cold that no man may drink thereof and in the night it is so hot that no man may suffer his hand therein <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and beyond that part toward the south to pass by the sea ocean is a great land and a great country but men may not dwell there for the fervent burning of the sun so is it passing hot in that country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia all the rivers and all the waters be trouble and they be somedeal salt for the great heat that is there <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the folk of that country be lightly drunken and have but little appetite to meat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they have commonly the flux of the womb <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia be many diverse folk and ethiope is clept cusis <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in that country be folk that have but one foot and they go so blyve that it is marvel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the foot is so large that it shadoweth all the body against the sun when they will lie and rest them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia when the children be young and little they be all yellow and when that they wax of age that yellowness turneth to be all black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in ethiopia is the city of saba and the land of the which one of the three kings that presented our lord in bethlehem was king of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from ethiopia men go into ind by many diverse countries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and ind is divided in three principal parts that is the more that is a full hot country and ind the less that is a full attempre country that stretcheth to the land of media and the three part toward the septentrion is full cold so that for pure cold and continual frost the water becometh crystal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and upon those rocks of crystal grow the good diamonds that be of trouble colour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be so hard that no man may polish them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men clepe them diamonds in that country and hamese in another country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> other diamonds men find in arabia that be not so good and they be more brown and more tender <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and other diamonds also men find in the isle of cyprus that be yet more tender and them men may well polish <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the land of macedonia men find diamonds also <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the best and the most precious be in ind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men find many times hard diamonds in a mass that cometh out of gold when men pure it and refine it out of the mine when men break that mass in small pieces and sometime it happens that men find some as great as a peas and some less and they be as hard as those of ind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and albeit that men find good diamonds in ind yet nevertheless men find them more commonly upon the rocks in the sea and upon hills where the mine of gold is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they grow many together one little another great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and there be some of the greatness of a bean and some as great as an hazel nut <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be square and pointed of their own kind both above and beneath without working of mans hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be nourished with the dew of heaven <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they engender commonly and bring forth small children that multiply and grow all the year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have oftentimes assayed that if a man keep them with a little of the rock and wet them with maydew oftsithes they shall grow every year and the small will wax great <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for right as the fine pearl congealeth and waxeth great of the dew of heaven right so doth the very diamond and right as the pearl of his own kind taketh roundness right so the diamond by virtue of god taketh squareness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and men shall bear the diamond on his left side for it is of greater virtue then than on the right side for the strength of their growing is toward the north that is the left side of the world and the left part of man is when he turneth his face toward the east <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if you like to know the virtues of the diamond as men may find in the lapidary that many men know not i shall tell you as they beyond the sea say and affirm of whom all science and all philosophy cometh from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he that beareth the diamond upon him it giveth him hardiness and manhood and it keepeth the limbs of his body whole <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it giveth him victory of his enemies in plea and in war if his cause be rightful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it keepeth him that beareth it in good wit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it keepeth him from strife and riot from evil swevens from sorrows and from enchantments and from fantasies and illusions of wicked spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if any cursed witch or enchanter would bewitch him that beareth the diamond all that sorrow and mischance shall turn to himself through virtue of that stone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and also no wild beast dare assail the man that beareth it on him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also the diamond should be given freely without coveting and without buying and then it is of greater virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it maketh a man more strong and more sad against his enemies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and it healeth him that is lunatic and them that the fiend pursueth or travaileth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and if venom or poison be brought in presence of the diamond anon it beginneth to wax moist and for to sweat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there be also diamonds in ind that be clept violastres for their colour is like violet or more brown than the violets that be full hard and full precious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but yet some men love not them so well as the other but in sooth to me i would love them as much as the other for i have seen them assayed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also there is another manner of diamonds that be as white as crystal but they be a little more trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and they be good and of great virtue and all they be square and pointed of their own kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and some be six squared some four squared and some three as nature shapeth them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore when great lords and knights go to seek worship in arms they bear gladly the diamond upon them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i shall speak a little more of the diamonds although i tarry my matter for a time to the end that they that know them not be not deceived by gabbers that go by the country that sell them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for whoso will buy the diamond it is needful to him that he know them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because that men counterfeit them often of crystal that is yellow and of sapphires of citron colour that is yellow also and of the sapphire loupe and of many other stones <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two officials stared at each other in amazement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is unique in my thirty years of experience said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the special has gone wrong between kenyon junction and barton moss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and yet there is no siding so far as my memory serves me between the two stations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the special must have run off the metals <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how could the fourfifty parliamentary pass over the same line without observing it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> possibly the local train may have observed something which may throw some light upon the matter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we will wire to manchester for more information and to kenyon junction with instructions that the line be examined instantly as far as barton moss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the answer from manchester came within a few minutes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> driver and guard of slow train positive no accident between kenyon junction and barton moss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> line quite clear and no sign of anything unusualmanchester <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that driver and guard will have to go said mr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there has been a wreck and they have missed it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the special has obviously run off the metals without disturbing the linehow it could have done so passes my comprehensionbut so it must be and we shall have a wire from kenyon or barton moss presently to say that they have found her at the bottom of an embankment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> blands prophecy was not destined to be fulfilled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> half an hour passed and then there arrived the following message there are no traces of the missing special <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is quite certain that she passed here and that she did not arrive at barton moss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we have detached engine from goods train and i have myself ridden down the line but all is clear and there is no sign of any accident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does a train vanish into thin air in england in broad daylight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an engine a tender two carriages a van five human beingsand all lost on a straight line of railway <end> <end> 
<start> <start> unless we get something positive within the next hour ill take inspector collins and go down myself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and then at last something positive did occur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took the shape of another telegram from kenyon junction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> regret to report that the dead body of john slater driver of the special train has just been found among the gorse bushes at a point two and a quarter miles from the junction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had fallen from his engine pitched down the embankment and rolled among the bushes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> injuries to his head from the fall appear to be cause of death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ground has now been carefully examined and there is no trace of the missing train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the country was as has already been stated in the throes of a political crisis and the attention of the public was further distracted by the important and sensational developments in paris where a huge scandal threatened to destroy the government and to wreck the reputations of many of the leading men in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the papers were full of these events and the singular disappearance of the special train attracted less attention than would have been the case in more peaceful times <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the grotesque nature of the event helped to detract from its importance for the papers were disinclined to believe the facts as reported to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> more than one of the london journals treated the matter as an ingenious hoax until the coroners inquest upon the unfortunate driver an inquest which elicited nothing of importance convinced them of the tragedy of the incident <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bland accompanied by inspector collins the senior detective officer in the service of the company went down to kenyon junction the same evening and their research lasted throughout the following day but was attended with purely negative results <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not only was no trace found of the missing train but no conjecture could be put forward which could possibly explain the facts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time inspector collinss official report which lies before me as i write served to show that the possibilities were more numerous than might have been expected <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the stretch of railway between these two points said he the country is dotted with ironworks and collieries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of these some are being worked and some have been abandoned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are no fewer than twelve which have smallgauge lines which run trolly cars down to the main line <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides these however there are seven which have or have had proper lines running down and connecting with points to the main line so as to convey their produce from the mouth of the mine to the great centres of distribution <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in every case these lines are only a few miles in length <end> <end> 
<start> <start> out of the seven four belong to collieries which are worked out or at least to shafts which are no longer used <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these are the redgauntlet hero slough of despond and heartsease mines the latter having ten years ago been one of the principal mines in lancashire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these four side lines may be eliminated from our inquiry for to prevent possible accidents the rails nearest to the main line have been taken up and there is no longer any connection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there remain three other side a to the carnstock iron works b to the big ben colliery c to the perseverance colliery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of these the big ben line is not more than a quarter of a mile long and ends at a dead wall of coal waiting removal from the mouth of the mine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nothing had been seen or heard there of any special <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the carnstock iron works line was blocked all day upon the rd of june by sixteen truckloads of hematite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a single line and nothing could have passed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to the perseverance line it is a large double line which does a considerable traffic for the output of the mine is very large <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the rd of june this traffic proceeded as usual hundreds of men including a gang of railway platelayers were working along the two miles and a quarter which constitute the total length of the line and it is inconceivable that an unexpected train could have come down there without attracting universal attention <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may be remarked in conclusion that this branch line is nearer to st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helens than the point at which the enginedriver was discovered so that we have every reason to believe that the train was past that point before misfortune overtook her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as to john slater there is no clue to be gathered from his appearance or injuries <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we can only say that so far as we can see he met his end by falling off his engine though why he fell or what became of the engine after his fall is a question upon which i do not feel qualified to offer an opinion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in conclusion the inspector offered his resignation to the board being much nettled by an accusation of incompetence in the london papers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a month elapsed during which both the police and the company prosecuted their inquiries without the slightest success <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a reward was offered and a pardon promised in case of crime but they were both unclaimed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but they did not grow careless and charley confessed that this was one of the times when all signs failed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> their patience seemed equal to ours and the second week of the siege dragged monotonously along <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then charleys lagging imagination quickened sufficiently to suggest a ruse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> peter boyelen a new patrolman and one unknown to the fisherfolk happened to arrive in benicia and we took him into our plan <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were as secret as possible about it but in some unfathomable way the friends ashore got word to the beleaguered italians to keep their eyes open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the night we were to put our ruse into effect charley and i took up our usual station in our rowing skiff alongside the lancashire queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after it was thoroughly dark peter boyelen came out in a crazy duck boat the kind you can pick up and carry away under one arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when we heard him coming along paddling noisily we slipped away a short distance into the darkness and rested on our oars <end> <end> 
<start> <start> opposite the gangway having jovially hailed the anchor watch of the lancashire queen and asked the direction of the scottish chiefs another wheat ship he awkwardly capsized himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man who was standing the anchorwatch ran down the gangway and hauled him out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was what he wanted to get aboard the ship and the next thing he expected was to be taken on deck and then below to warm up and dry out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the captain inhospitably kept him perched on the lowest gangway step shivering miserably and with his feet dangling in the water till we out of very pity rowed in from the darkness and took him off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the jokes and gibes of the awakened crew sounded anything but sweet in our ears and even the two italians climbed up on the rail and laughed down at us long and maliciously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats all right charley said in a low voice which i only could hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im mighty glad its not us thats laughing first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well save our laugh to the end eh lad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he clapped a hand on my shoulder as he finished but it seemed to me that there was more determination than hope in his voice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would have been possible for us to secure the aid of united states marshals and board the english ship backed by government authority <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the instructions of the fish commission were to the effect that the patrolmen should avoid complications and this one did we call on the higher powers might well end in a pretty international tangle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second week of the siege drew to its close and there was no sign of change in the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the morning of the fourteenth day the change came and it came in a guise as unexpected and startling to us as it was to the men we were striving to capture <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charley and i after our customary night vigil by the side of the lancashire queen rowed into the solana wharf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the name of reason and common sense what is that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of all unmannerly craft did you ever see the like <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well might he exclaim for there tied up to the dock lay the strangest looking launch i had ever seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not that it could be called a launch either but it seemed to resemble a launch more than any other kind of boat <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was seventy feet long but so narrow was it and so bare of superstructure that it appeared much smaller than it really was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was built wholly of steel and was painted black <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he left on the yacht this morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an answer so obstructing to the natural escape of his irritation left glennard with no momentary resource but that of strolling impatiently to the window <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as her eyes followed him they lit on the books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he answered over his shoulder for a woman who never reads you make the most astounding exceptions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her smile was an exasperating concession to the probability that it had been hot in town or that something had bothered him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you mean its not nice to want to read the book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was not nice to publish it certainly but after all im not responsible for that am i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she paused and as he made no answer went on still smiling i do read sometimes you know and im very fond of margaret aubyns books <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was reading pomegranate seed when we first met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was then you told me all about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard had turned back into the room and stood staring at his wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he repeated and with the words remembrance came to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had found miss trent one afternoon with the novel in her hand and moved by the lovers fatuous impulse to associate himself in some way with whatever fills the mind of the beloved had broken through his habitual silence about the past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> rewarded by the consciousness of figuring impressively in miss trents imagination he had gone on from one anecdote to another reviving dormant details of his old hillbridge life and pasturing his vanity on the eagerness with which she received his reminiscences of a being already clothed in the impersonality of greatness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the incident had left no trace in his mind but it sprang up now like an old enemy the more dangerous for having been forgotten <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the instinct of selfpreservationsometimes the most perilous that man can exercisemade him awkwardly declareoh i used to see her at peoples houses that was all and her silence as usual leaving room for a multiplication of blunders he added with increased indifference i simply cant see what you can find to interest you in such a book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i glanced at iti never read such things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it true that she didnt wish the letters to be published <end> <end> 
<start> <start> glennard felt the sudden dizziness of the mountaineer on a narrow ledge and with it the sense that he was lost if he looked more than a step ahead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im sure i dont know he said then summoning a smile he passed his hand through her arm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i didnt have tea at the dreshams you know wont you give me some now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but are not all the frauds that fool the human race crude <end> <end> 
<start> <start> human beings both cannot and will not look beneath surfaces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all mildred learned was that jennings did not give up paying pupils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had not confidence enough in this discovery to put it to the test <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not dare disobey him or shirk even when she was most disposed to do so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but gradually she ceased from that intense application she had at first brought to her work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she seemed to be toiling as in the beginning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in reality she became by the middle of spring a mere lessontaker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her interest in clothes and in going about revived <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw in the newspapers that general siddall had taken a party of friends on a yachting trip around the world so she felt that she was no longer being searched for at least not vigorously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she became acquainted with smart rich west side women taking lessons at jenningss <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she amused herself going about with them and with the musical men they attractedamateur and semiprofessional singers and players upon instruments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had little parties at the flat in fiftyninth streetthe most delightful little parties imaginabledinners and suppers music clever conversations flirtations of a harmless but fascinating kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if anyone had accused mildred of neglecting her work of forgetting her career she would have grown indignant and if mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley had overheard she would have been indignant for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was doing all that could be done <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it takes time to develop a voice to make an operasinger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forcing is dangerous when it is not downright useless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in maytoward the end of the monthstanley baird returned <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mildred who happened to be in unusually good voice that day sang for him at the jennings studio and he was enchanted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we want to get that upper register right first <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and its a young voiceshes very young for her age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we must be why whats a voice for if not to sing with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a fine voice is a very delicate instrument replied the teacher <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he added coldly you must let me judge certainly certainly said stanley in haste <end> <end> 
<start> <start> shes had several colds this winter and spring pursued jennings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> those things are dangerous until the voice has its full growth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she should have two jennings was going away for a two months vacation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was giving this advice to all his pupils <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i hate to stop work objected mildred <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im very impatient of and honest she was in this protest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had no idea of the state of her own mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she fancied she was still as eager as ever for the career as intensely interested as ever in her work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did not dream of the real meaning of her content with her voice as it was of her lack of uneasiness over the appalling fact that such voice as she had was unreliable came and went for no apparent reason <end> <end> 
<start> <start> absolute rest for two months declared jennings mildred gave a resigned sigh <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is much inveighing against hypocrisy a vice unsightly rather than desperately wicked <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in the excitement about it its dangerous even deadly near kinsman selfdeception escapes unassailed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seven cardinal sins but what of the eighth?the parent of all the others the one beside which the children seem almost white <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the first few weeks mildred had been careful about spending money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> economy she did not understand how could she when she had never had a lesson in it or a valuable hint about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the only way in which such people can keep order in their finances is by not spending any money at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this so long as she gave her whole mind to her work <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but after the first great cold so depressing so subtly undermining she began to go about to think of to need and to buy clothes to spend money in a dozen necessary ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after all she was simply borrowing the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> presently she would be making a career would be earning large sums <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stanley meant for her to use the money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how would her career be helped by her going about looking a dowd and a frump <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had always been used to the comforts of life <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she deprived herself of them she would surely get into a frame of mind where her work would suffer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no she must lead the normal life of a woman of her class <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to work all the timewhy as jennings said that took away all the freshness made one stale and unfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little distractionalways of course with musical people people who talked and thought and did musicthat sort of distraction was quite as much a part of her education as the singing lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley certainly a sensible and serious woman if ever there was onemrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindley believed so and it must be so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after that illness and before she began to go about she had fallen into several fits of hideous blues had been in despair as to the future <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as soon as she saw something of peoplealways the valuable musical sort of peopleher spirits improved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when she got a few new dressesvery simple and inexpensive but stylish and charmingand the hats too were successful as soon as she was freshly arrayed she was singing better and was talking hopefully of the career again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes it was really necessary that she live as she had always been used to living <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when stanley came back her account was drawn up to the last cent of the proportionate amount <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in fact it might have been a few dollarsa hundred or so overdrawn <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during the summer she would spend less and by fall she would be far ahead againand ready to no indeed cried she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ive been living within the hundred a weekor nearly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why three or four nights of singing will i suppose i will make a lot of money said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hastily added i dont mean the career <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can hardly wait to begin at the roles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see i never earned well youll have plenty of it in two or three years said stanley confidently <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you mustnt try to live like girls whove been brought up to hardship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it isnt necessary and it would only unfit you for your i think thats true said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she gave him a nervous shy almost agonized look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> please dont try to put me please dont talk nonsense about obligation retorted he <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you dont seem to realize that youre doing me a favor that its a privilege to be allowed to help develop such a marvelous voice as yours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> scores of people would jump that doesnt lessen my obligation said she <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she thought she meant it though in fact his generous and plausible statement of the case had immediately lessened not a little her sense of obligation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the whole however she was not sorry she had this chance to talk of obligation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> slowly as they saw each other from time to time often alone stanley had begunperhaps in spite of himself and unconsciously to show his feeling for her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes his hand accidentally touched hers and he did not draw it away as quickly as he might <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and sheit was impossible for her to make any gesture much less say anything that suggested sensitiveness on her part <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it would put him in an awkward position would humiliate him most unjustly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell into the habit of holding her hand longer than was necessary at greeting or parting of touching her caressingly of looking at her with the eyes of a lover instead of a friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for some mysterious reasonfrom sheer perversity she thoughtshe had taken a strong physical dislike to him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> perfectly absurd for there was nothing intrinsically repellent about this handsome clean most attractively dressed man of the best type of american and newyorker <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no only perversity could explain such a silly notion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was always afraid he would try to take advantage of her delicate positionalways afraid she would have to yield something some trifle yet the idea of giving anything from a sense of obligation was galling to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his very refraining made her more nervous the more shrinking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he would only commit some overt actseize her kiss her make outrageous demandsbut this refrain ing these touches that might be accidental and again might be stealthy approach she hated to have him shake hands with her would have liked to draw away when his clothing chanced to brush against hers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so she was glad of the talk about obligation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ceased to look lovingly to indulge in the nerverasping little caresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was evidently eager to prove the sincerity of his protestationstoo eager perhaps her perverse mind suggested <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still sincere or not he held to all the forms of sincerity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> brindleys who were going abroad offered her their cottage on the new jersey coast near seabright and a big new touringcar and chauffeur <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she and mildred at once gave up the plan for a summer in the adirondacks the more readily as several of the men and women they saw the most of lived within easy distance of them at deal beach and elberon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when mildred went shopping she was lured into buying a lot of summer things she would not have needed in the adirondacksa mere matter of two hundred and fifty dollars or thereabouts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a little additional economy in the fall would soon make up for such a trifle and if there is one time more than another when a woman wishes to look well and must look well that time is summerespecially by the sea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when her monthly statement from the bank came on the first of july she found that five thousand dollars had been deposited to her credit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was moved by this discovery to devote several hoursvery depressed hours they wereto her finances <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had spent a great deal more money than she had thought indeed since march she had been living at the rate of fifteen thousand a year <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she tried to account for this amazing extravagance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she could recall no expenditure that was not really almost if not quite necessary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> because i didnt know any french but two or three words and i didnt know any latin or greek at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should you want to use foreign words anyhow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anybody has a right to that wants to <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i then proceeded in the following scathing manner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when really learned men write books for other learned men to read they are justified in using as many learned words as they pleasetheir audience will understand them but a man who writes a book for the general public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pages with untranslated foreign expressions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is an insolence toward the majority of the purchasers for it is a very frank and impudent way of saying get the translations made yourself if you want them this book is not written for the ignorant classes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are men who know a foreign language so well and have used it so long in their daily life that they seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their english writings unconsciously and so they omit to translate as much as half the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the mans readers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the writer would say he only uses the foreign language where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyed in english <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well then he writes his best things for the tenth man and he ought to warn the nine other not to buy his book <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however the excuse he offers is at least an excuse but there is another set of men who are like you they know a word here and there of a foreign language or a few beggarly little threeword phrases filched from the back of the dictionary and these are continually peppering into their literature with a pretense of knowing that languagewhat excuse can they offer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the foreign words and phrases which they use have their exact equivalents in a nobler languageenglish yet they think they adorn their page when they say strasse for street and bahnhof for railwaystation and so onflaunting these fluttering rags of poverty in the readers face and imagining he will be ass enough to take them for the sign of untold riches held in reserve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will let your learning remain in your report you have as much right i suppose to adorn your page with zulu and chinese and choctaw rubbish as others of your sort have to adorn theirs with insolent odds and ends smouched from half a dozen learned tongues whose ab abs they dont even know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the musing spider steps upon the redhot shovel he first exhibits a wild surprise then he shrivels up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> similar was the effect of these blistering words upon the tranquil and unsuspecting agent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can be dreadfully rough chapter xxxi we now prepared for a considerable walkfrom lucerne to interlaken over the brunig pass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but at the last moment the weather was so good that i changed my mind and hired a fourhorse carriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a huge vehicle roomy as easy we got away pretty early in the morning after a hot breakfast and went bowling over a hard smooth road through the summer loveliness of switzerland with near and distant lakes and mountains before and about us for the entertainment of the eye and the music of multitudinous birds to charm the ear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes there was only the width of the road between the imposing precipices on the right and the clear cool water on the left with its shoals of uncatchable fish skimming about through the bars of sun and shadow and sometimes in place of the precipices the grassy land stretched away in an apparently endless upward slant and was dotted everywhere with snug little chalets the ordinary chalet turns a broad honest gable end to the road and its ample roof hovers over the home in a protecting caressing way projecting its sheltering eaves far outward <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the quaint windows are filled with little panes and garnished with white muslin curtains and brightened with boxes of blooming flowers <end> <end> 
<start> <start> across the front of the house and up the spreading eaves and along the fanciful railings of the shallow porch are elaborate carvingswreaths fruits arabesques verses from scripture names dates etc <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the building is wholly of wood reddish brown in tint a very pleasing color <end> <end> 
<start> <start> set such a house against the fresh green of the hillside and it looks ever so cozy and inviting and picturesque one does not find out what a hold the chalet has taken upon him until he presently comes upon a new house a house which is aping the town fashions of germany and france a prim hideous straightupanddown thing plastered all over on the outside to look like stone and altogether so stiff and formal and ugly and forbidding and so out of tune with the gracious landscape and so deaf and dumb and dead to the poetry of its surroundings that it suggests an undertaker at a picnic a corpse at in the course of the morning we passed the spot where pontius pilate is said to have thrown himself into the lake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the legend goes that after the crucifixion his conscience troubled him and he fled from jerusalem and wandered about the earth weary of life and a prey to tortures of the mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> eventually he hid himself away on the heights of mount pilatus and dwelt alone among the clouds and crags for years but rest and peace were still denied him presently we passed the place where a man of better odor was born <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was the childrens friend santa claus or st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there are some unaccountable reputations in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has ranked for ages as the peculiar friend of children yet it appears he was not much of a friend to his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had ten of them and when fifty years old he left them and sought out as dismal a refuge from the world as possible and became a hermit in order that he might reflect upon pious themes without being disturbed by the joyous and other judging by pilate and st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholas there exists no rule for the construction of hermits they seem made out of all kinds of material <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but pilate attended to the matter of expiating his sin while he was alive whereas st <end> <end> 
<start> <start> nicholas will probably have to go on climbing down sooty chimneys christmas eve forever and conferring kindness on other peoples children to make up for deserting his own <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his bones are kept in a church in a village sachseln which we visited and are naturally held in great reverence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his portrait is common in the farmhouses of the region but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> during his hermit life according to legend he partook of the bread and wine of the communion once a month a constant marvel with us as we sped along the bases of the steep mountains on this journey was not that avalanches occur but that they are not occurring all the time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one does not understand why rocks and landslides do not plunge down these declivities daily <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a landslip occurred three quarters of a century ago on the route from arth to brunnen which was a formidable thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a mass of conglomerate two miles long a thousand feet broad and a hundred feet thick broke away from a cliff three thousand feet high and hurled itself into the valley below we had such a beautiful day and such endless pictures of limpid lakes and green hills and valleys and majestic mountains and milky cataracts dancing down the steeps and gleaming in the sun that we could not help feeling sweet toward all the world so we tried to drink all the milk and eat all the grapes and apricots and berries and buy all the bouquets of wild flowers which the little peasant boys and girls offered for sale at short distancesand they were entirely too shortall along the road were groups of neat and comely children with their wares nicely and temptingly set forth in the grass under the shade trees and as soon as we approached they swarmed into the road holding out their baskets and milk bottles and ran beside the carriage barefoot and bareheaded and importuned us to buy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they seldom desisted early but continued to run and insistbeside the wagon while they could and behind it until they lost breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then they turned and chased a returning carriage back to their tradingpost again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after several hours of this without any intermission it becomes almost annoying <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not know what we should have done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however there were plenty of these loaded with dusty tourists and piled high with luggage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed from lucerne to interlaken we had the spectacle among other scenery of an unbroken procession of our talk was mostly anticipatory of what we should see on the downgrade of the brunig by and by after we should pass the summit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all our friends in lucerne had said that to look down upon meiringen and the rushing bluegray river aar and the broad level green valley and across at the mighty alpine precipices that rise straight up to the clouds out of that valley and up at the microscopic chalets perched upon the dizzy eaves of those precipices and winking dimly and fitfully through the drifting veil of vapor and still up and up at the superb oltschiback and the other beautiful cascades that leap from those rugged heights robed in powdery spray ruffled with foam and girdled with rainbowsto look upon these things they say was to look upon the last possibility of the sublime and the enchanting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> therefore as i say we talked mainly of these coming wonders if we were conscious of any impatience it was to get there in favorable season if we felt any anxiety it was that the day might remain perfect and enable us to see those marvels at their best <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we approached the kaiserstuhl a part of the harness gave way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in distress for a moment but only a moment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the foreandaft gear that was brokenthe thing that leads aft from the forward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the wagon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in america this would have been a heavy leathern strap but all over the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the size of your little fingerclothesline is what it is <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cabs use it private carriages freightcarts and wagons all sorts of vehicles have it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in munich i afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fiftyfour halfbarrels of beer i had before noticed that the cabs in heidelberg used itnot new rope but rope that had been in use since abrahams time and i had felt nervous sometimes behind it when the cab was tearing down a hill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i had long been accustomed to it now and had even become afraid of the leather strap which belonged in its place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> our driver got a fresh piece of clothesline out of his so much for one european fashion <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it may interest the reader to know how they put horses to on the continent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the man stands up the horses on each side of the thing that projects from the front end of the wagon and then throws the tangled mess of gear forward through a ring and hauls it aft and passes the other thing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the other horse opposite to the first one after crossing them and bringing the loose end back and then buckles the other thing underneath the horse and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing i spoke of before and puts another thing over each horses head with broad flappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes and puts the iron thing in his mouth for him to grit his teeth on uphill and brings the ends of these things aft over his back after buckling another one around under his neck to hold his head up and hitching another thing on a thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is climbing a hill and then takes the slack of the thing which i mentioned a while ago and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon and hands the other things up to the driver to steer with <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never have buckled up a horse myself but i do not think we had four very handsome horses and the driver was very proud of his turnout <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would bowl along on a reasonable trot on the highway but when he entered a village he did it on a furious run and accompanied it with a frenzy of ceaseless whipcrackings that sounded like volleys of musketry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tore through the narrow streets and around the sharp curves like a moving earthquake showering his volleys as he went and before him swept a continuous tidal wave of scampering children ducks cats and mothers clasping babies which they had snatched out of the way of the coming destruction and as this living wave washed aside along the walls its elements being safe forgot their fears and turned their admiring gaze upon that gallant driver he was a great man to those villagers with his gaudy clothes and his terrific ways <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whenever he stopped to have his cattle watered and fed with loaves of bread the villagers stood around admiring him while he swaggered about the little boys gazed up at his face with humble homage and the landlord brought out foaming mugs of beer and conversed proudly with him while he drank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he mounted his lofty box swung his explosive whip and away he went again like a storm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not seen anything like this before since i was a boy and the stage used to flourish the village with the dust flying when we reached the base of the kaiserstuhl we took two more horses we had to toil along with difficulty for an hour and a half or two hours for the ascent was not very gradual but when we passed the backbone and approached the station the driver surpassed all his previous efforts in the way of rush and clatter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he could not have six horses all the time so he made up to this point we had been in the heart of the william tell region <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the hero is not forgotten by any means or held in doubtful veneration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his wooden image with his bow drawn above the doors of taverns was a about noon we arrived at the foot of the brunig pass and made a twohour stop at the village hotel another of those clean pretty and thoroughly wellkept inns which are such an astonishment to people who are accustomed to hotels of a dismally different pattern in remote countrytowns <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a lake here in the lap of the great mountains the green slopes that rose toward the lower crags were graced with scattered swiss cottages nestling among miniature farms and gardens and from out a leafy carriage after carriage laden with tourists and trunks arrived and the quiet hotel was soon populous <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were early at the table dhote and saw the people all come in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were of various nationalities but we were the only americans <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next to me sat an english bride and next to her sat her new husband whom she called neddy though he was big enough and stalwart enough to be entitled to his full name <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they had a pretty little lovers quarrel over what wine they should have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> neddy was for obeying the guidebook what that nahsty stuff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its oful nahsty neddy and i shahnt drink it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then the question was what she must have <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hunter was steady that we knew joyce was a doubtful casea pleasant polite man for a valet and to brush ones clothes but not entirely fitted for a man of war <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with all this in our minds we waded ashore as fast as we could leaving behind us the poor jollyboat and a good half of all our powder and provisions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> narrative continued by the doctor end of the we made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain said i trelawney is the dead shot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give him your gun his own is useless <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they exchanged guns and trelawney silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the same time observing gray to be unarmed i handed him my cutlass <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand knit his brows and make the blade sing through the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side and almost at the same time seven mutineersjob anderson the boatswain at their headappeared in full cry at the southwestern corner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they paused as if taken aback and before they recovered not only the squire and i but hunter and joyce from the block house had time to fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the four shots came in rather a scattering volley but they did the business one of the enemy actually fell and the rest without hesitation turned and plunged into the trees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after reloading we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush a ball whistled close past my ear and poor tom redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground <end> <end> 
<start> <start> both the squire and i returned the shot but as we had nothing to aim at it is probable we only wasted powder <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor tom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the captain and gray were already examining him and i saw with half an eye that all was over <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried groaning and bleeding into the loghouse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> poor old fellow he had not uttered one word of surprise complaint fear or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now when we had laid him down in the loghouse to die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had lain like a trojan behind his mattress in the gallery he had followed every order silently doggedly and well he was the oldest of our party by a score of years and now sullen old serviceable servant it was he that was to die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand crying like a child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom my man said i youre going home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i had had a lick at them with the gun first he replied <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tom said the squire say you forgive me wont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would that be respectful like from me to you squire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after a little while of silence he said he thought somebody might read a prayer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and not long after without another word he passed away <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the meantime the captain whom i had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets had turned out a great many various storesthe british colours a bible a coil of stoutish rope pen ink the logbook and pounds of tobacco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had found a longish firtree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure and with the help of hunter he had set it up at the corner of the loghouse where the trunks crossed and made an angle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then climbing on the roof he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he reentered the loghouse and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he had an eye on toms passage for all that and as soon as all was over came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont you take on sir he said shaking the squires hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> alls well with him no fear for a hand thats been shot down in his duty to captain and owner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it maynt be good divinity but its a fact <end> <end> 
<start> <start> livesey he said in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i told him it was a question not of weeks but of months that if we were not back by the end of august blandly was to send to find us but neither sooner nor later <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why yes returned the captain scratching his head and making a large allowance sir for all the gifts of providence i should say we were pretty close hauled <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its a pity sir we lost that second load <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the rations are short very short so short dr <end> <end> 
<start> <start> livesey that were perhaps as well without that extra mouth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he pointed to the dead body under the flag <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just then with a roar and a whistle a roundshot passed high above the roof of the loghouse and plumped far beyond us in the wood <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the second trial the aim was better and the ball descended inside the stockade scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> captain said the squire the house is quite invisible from the ship <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he moved toward the door opened it sighed and paused with a backward look <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just the same he murmured plaintively the bottoms of my feet is itching something terrible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> long before the family stirred next morning his horses fed and harnessed by lantern light breakfast cooked and eaten by lamp fight old man tarwater was off and away down tarwater valley on the road to kelterville <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two things were unusual about this usual trip which he had made a thousand and forty times since taking the mail contract <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not drive to kelterville but turned off on the main road south to santa rosa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even more remarkable than this was the paperwrapped parcel between his feet <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it contained his one decent black suit which mary had been long reluctant to see him wear any more not because it was shabby but because as he guessed what was at the back of her mind it was decent enough to bury him in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and at santa rosa in a secondhand clothes shop he sold the suit outright for two dollars and a half <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the same obliging shopman he received four dollars for the wedding ring of his long dead wife <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the span of horses and the wagon he disposed of for seventyfive dollars although twentyfive was all he received down in cash <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chancing to meet alton granger on the street to whom never before had he mentioned the ten dollars loaned him in he reminded alton granger of the little affair and was promptly paid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also of all unbelievable men to be in funds he so found the town drunkard for whom he had bought many a drink in the old and palmy days <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and from him john tarwater borrowed a dollar <end> <end> 
<start> <start> finally he took the afternoon train to san francisco <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a dozen days later carrying a halfempty canvas sack of blankets and old clothes he landed on the beach of dyea in the thick of the great klondike rush <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ten thousand tons of outfit lay heaped and scattered and twice ten thousand men struggled with it and clamoured about it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> freight by indianback over chilcoot to lake linderman had jumped from sixteen to thirty cents a pound which latter was a rate of six hundred dollars a ton <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the subarctic winter gloomed near at hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all knew it and all knew that of the twenty thousand of them very few would get across the passes leaving the rest to winter and wait for the late spring thaw <end> <end> 
<start> <start> such the beach old john tarwater stepped upon and straight across the beach and up the trail toward chilcoot he headed cackling his ancient chant a very grandfather argus himself with no outfit worry in the world for he did not possess any outfit <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that night he slept on the flats five miles above dyea at the head of canoe navigation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> here the dyea river became a rushing mountain torrent plunging out of a dark canyon from the glaciers that fed it far above <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and here early next morning he beheld a little man weighing no more than a hundred staggering along a footlog under all of a hundred pounds of flour strapped on his back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> also he beheld the little man stumble off the log and fall facedownward in a quiet eddy where the water was two feet deep and proceed quietly to drown <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was no desire of his to take death so easily but the flour on his back weighed as much as he and would not let him up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you old man he said to tarwater when the latter had dragged him up into the air and ashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while he unlaced his shoes and ran the water out they had further talk <end> <end> 
<start> <start> next he fished out a tendollar goldpiece and offered it to his rescuer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> old tarwater shook his head and shivered for the icewater had wet him to his knees <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i reckon i wouldnt object to settin down to a friendly meal with you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the little man who was past forty and who had said his name was anson queried with a glance frankly curious <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was understood wasnt it that my grandmother was to be the first to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> welland so she has been hasnt she since youve told her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he turned back to his restless shifting of the knickknacks <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and youre sure that nothing youve said to darrow could possibly have given him a hint <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why do you put it in that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> whyas if you thought some one else might have spoken <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what on earth my dear boy can you be driving at <end> <end> 
<start> <start> im trying to find out whether you think he knows anything definite <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the sound of a step in the gallery she added here he isyou can ask him yourself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she met darrows knock with an invitation to enter and he came into the room and paused between herself and owen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was struck as he stood there by the contrast between his happy careless goodlooks and her stepsons frowning agitation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no i was just going to get ready <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she continued to linger between the two looking slowly from one to the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but theres something we want to tell you first owen is engaged to miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sense of an indefinable interrogation in owens mind made her as she spoke fix her eyes steadily on darrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had paused just opposite the window so that even in the rainy afternoon light his face was clearly open to her scrutiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for a second immense surprise was alone visible on it so visible that she half turned to her stepson with a faint smile for his refuted suspicions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why she wondered should owen have thought that darrow had already guessed his secret and what after all could be so disturbing to him in this not improbable contingency <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at any rate his doubt must have been dispelled there was nothing feigned about darrows astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when her eyes turned back to him he was already crossing to owen with outstretched hand and she had through an unaccountable faint flutter of misgiving a mere confused sense of their exchanging the customary phrases <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her next perception was of owens tranquillized look and of his smiling return of darrows congratulatory grasp <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had the eerie feeling of having been overswept by a shadow which there had been no cloud to cast <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a moment later owen had left the room and she and darrow were alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had turned away to the window and stood staring out into the downpour <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you hadnt thought of its being miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why should i have thought of miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you see now why i wanted so much to find out what you knew about her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he made no comment and she pursued now that you do know its she if theres anything he moved back into the room and went up to her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his face was serious with a slight shade of annoyance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as i told you ive never in my life heard any one say two words about miss viner <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anna made no answer and they continued to face each other without moving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the moment she had ceased to think about sophy viner and owen the only thought in her mind was that darrow was alone with her close to her and that for the first time their hands and lips had not met <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she hesitated as if waiting for him to urge her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i ought to go at once to my mother inlawowens just been telling her she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that accounts for my having on my way up heard some one telephoning for miss painter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at the allusion they laughed together vaguely and anna moved toward the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he held it open for her and followed her out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he left her at the door of madame de chantelles sitting room and plunged out alone into the rain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wind flung about the stripped treetops of the avenue and dashed the stinging streams into his face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he walked to the gate and then turned into the highroad and strode along in the open buffeted by slanting gusts <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the evenly ridged fields were a blurred waste of mud and the russet coverts which he and owen had shot through the day before shivered desolately against a driving sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow walked on and on indifferent to the direction he was taking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> annas announcement had not come to him as a complete surprise that morning as he strolled back to the house with owen leath and miss viner he had had a momentary intuition of the truth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but it had been no more than an intuition the merest faint cloudpuff of surmise and now it was an attested fact darkening over the whole sky <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in respect of his own attitude he saw at once that the discovery made no appreciable change <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if he had been bound to silence before he was no less bound to it now the only difference lay in the fact that what he had just learned had rendered his bondage more intolerable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hitherto he had felt for sophy viners defenseless state a sympathy profoundly tinged with compunction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but now he was halfconscious of an obscure indignation against her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> superior as he had fancied himself to readymade judgments he was aware of cherishing the common doubt as to the disinterestedness of the woman who tries to rise above her past <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no wonder she had been sick with fear on meeting him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was in his power to do her more harm than he had dreamed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> assuredly he did not want to harm her but he did desperately want to prevent her marrying owen leath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he tried to get away from the feeling to isolate and exteriorize it sufficiently to see what motives it was made of but it remained a mere blind motion of his blood the instinctive recoil from the thing that no amount of arguing can make straight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his tramp prolonged as it was carried him no nearer to enlightenment and after trudging through two or three sallow mudstained villages he turned about and wearily made his way back to givre <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as he walked up the black avenue making for the lights that twinkled through its pitching branches he had a sudden realisation of his utter helplessness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he might think and combine as he would but there was nothing absolutely nothing that he could do <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he dropped his wet coat in the vestibule and began to mount the stairs to his room <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but on the landing he was overtaken by a soberfaced maid who in tones discreetly lowered begged him to be so kind as to step for a moment into the marquises sittingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> somewhat disconcerted by the summons he followed its bearer to the door at which a couple of hours earlier he had taken leave of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it opened to admit him to a large lamplit room which he immediately perceived to be empty and the fact gave him time to note even through his disturbance of mind the interesting degree to which madame de chantelles apartment dated and completed her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its looped and corded curtains its purple satin upholstery the sevres jardinieres the rosewood firescreen the little velvet tables edged with lace and crowded with silver knickknacks and simpering miniatures reconstituted an almost perfect setting for the blonde beauty of the sixties <end> <end> 
<start> <start> darrow wondered that fraser leaths filial respect should have prevailed over his aesthetic scruples to the extent of permitting such an anachronism among the eighteenth century graces of givre but a moments reflection made it clear that to its late owner the attitude would have seemed exactly in the traditions of the place <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame de chantelles emergence from an inner room snatched darrow from these irrelevant musings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was already beaded and bugled for the evening and save for a slight pinkness of the eyelids her elaborate appearance revealed no mark of agitation but darrow noticed that in recognition of the solemnity of the occasion she pinched a lace handkerchief between her thumb and forefinger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she plunged at once into the centre of the difficulty appealing to him in the name of all the everards to descend there with her to the rescue of her darling <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she wasnt she was sure addressing herself in vain to one whose person whose tone whose traditions so brilliantly declared his indebtedness to the principles she besought him to defend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her own reception of darrow the confidence she had at once accorded him must have shown him that she had instinctively felt their unanimity of sentiment on these fundamental questions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had in fact recognized in him the one person whom without pain to her maternal piety she could welcome as her sons successor and it was almost as to owens father that she now appealed to darrow to aid in rescuing the wretched boy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dont think please that im casting the least reflection on anna or showing any want of sympathy for her when i say that i consider her partly responsible for whats happened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> anna is moderni believe thats what its called when you read unsettling books and admire hideous pictures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> indeed madame de chantelle continued leaning confidentially forward i myself have always more or less lived in that atmosphere my son you know was very revolutionary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the first of these we reached without trouble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the second was also gained but the packs were wetted the current being exceedingly rapid <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the space remaining to be forded was at least two hundred yards and the stream so strong that i was obliged to turn my mares head up it to prevent her being carried off her legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while thus resting william with difficulty the water being over his knees sidled up to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he wanted to know if i still meant to cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in truth i had not the smallest misgiving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strong as was the current the smooth rocky bottom gave a good foothold to the animals and judging by the great width of the river there was no reason to suppose that its shallowness would not continue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we paused for a few minutes to observe samson who was now within forty or fifty yards of the opposite bank and as i concluded past all danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly to the astonishment of both of us he and his horse and the led animals disappeared under water the next instant they were struggling and swimming for the bank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tied together as they were there was a deal of snorting and plunging and samson with his habitual ingenuity had fastened the lariat either to himself or his saddle so that he was several times dragged under before they all got to the bank in safety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these events were watched by william with intense anxiety <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with a pitiable look of terror he assured me he could not swim a yard it was useless for him to try to cross he would turn back and find his way to salt lake city <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i remonstrated if you turn back you will certainly starve everything we possess is over there with the mules your blanket even your rifle are with the packs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is impossible to get the mules back again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give little cream her head sit still in your saddle and shell carry you through that bit of deep water with ease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can live by fishing he plaintively answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still held his long rod and the incongruity of it added to the pathos of his despair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i reminded him of a bad river we had before crossed and how his mule had swum it safely with him on her back <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i promised to keep close to him and help him if need were though i was confident if he left everything to cream there would be no danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but if anything happened to him would i write and tell mary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew her address leastways if i didnt it was in his bag on the brown mule <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water was so clear one could see every crack in the rock beneath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> fortunately i took the precaution to strip to my shirt fastened everything even my socks to the saddle then advanced cautiously ahead of william to the brink of the chasm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in fact upon the edge of a precipice <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one could see to an inch where the gulf began <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as my mare stepped into it i slipped off my saddle when she rose i laid hold of her tail and in two or three minutes should have been safe ashore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> looking back to see how it had fared with william i at once perceived his danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had clasped his mule tightly round the neck with his arms and round the body with his long legs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was plunging violently to get rid of her load <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already the pair were forty or fifty yards below me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instantly i turned and swam to his assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the struggles of the mule rendered it dangerous to get at him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i did so he was partially dazed his hold was relaxed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> dragging him away from the hoofs of the animal i begged him to put his hands on my shoulders or hips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was past any effort of the kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i do not think he heard me even <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his long wet hair plastered over the face concealed his features <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond stretching out his arms like an infant imploring help he made no effort to save himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i seized him firmly by the collar unfortunately with my right hand leaving only my left to stem the torrent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how to keep his face out of the water <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at every stroke i was losing strength we were being swept away for him to hopeless death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at length i touched bottom got both hands under his head and held it above the surface <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he still breathed still puffed the hair from his lips <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was still a hope if i could but maintain my footing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> each instant i was losing ground each instant i was driven back foot by foot towards the gulf <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the water at first only up to my chest was now up to my shoulders now up to my neck <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my arms ached till they could bear no more <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he fell like lead till his back lay stretched upon the rock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his arms were spread out so that his body formed a cross <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i paddled above it in the clear smooth water gazing at his familiar face till two or three large bubbles burst upon the surface then hardly knowing what i was doing floated mechanically from the trappers grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first the right or western bank being within sixty or seventy yards being also my proper goal i struck out for it with mere eagerness to land as soon as possible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very well then i would take it quietly not try to cross direct but swim on gently keeping my head that way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by degrees i got within twenty yards of the bank was counting joyfully on the rest which a few more strokes would bring me when wsh came a current and swept me right into the middle of the stream again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i must get out of this somehow or another better on the wrong side than not at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so i let myself go and made for the shore we had started from <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when well over to the left bank i was carried out again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my flannel shirt stuck to and impeded me i would have it off <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i got it over my head but hadnt unbuttoned the studs it stuck partly over my head <end> <end> 
<start> <start> got a drop of water into my windpipe was choking tugged till i got the shirt right again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then tried floating on my back to cough and get my breath <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sun was setting in glorious red and gold <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i noticed this noticed the salmon rolling like porpoises around me and thought of william with his rod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> strangest of all for i had not noticed her before little cream was still struggling for dear life not a hundred yards below me sometimes sinking sometimes reappearing but on her way to join her master as surely as i thought that i was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in my distress the predominant thought was the loneliness of my fate the loneliness of my body after death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was not a living thing to see me die <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for the first time i felt not fear but loss of hope <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could only beat the water with feeble and futile splashes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and as we all then do i prayed prayed for strength prayed that i might be spared <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could but just keep my nose or mouth above it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my legs sank and my feet touched bottom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in an instant as if from an electric shock a flush of energy suffused my brain and limbs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i stood upright in an almost tranquil pool <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an eddy had lodged me on a sandbank <end> <end> 
<start> <start> between it and the land was scarcely twenty yards <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through this gap the stream ran strong as ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i did not want to rest i did not pause to think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in i dashed and a single spurt carried me to the shore <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i fell on my knees and with a grateful heart poured out gratitude for my deliverance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was on the wrong side the side from which we started <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had not tasted food since our early meal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how long i had been swimming i know not but it was dark now starlight at least <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the nights were bitterly cold and my only clothing a wet flannel shirt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the craving for companionship someone to talk to even samson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was a stronger need than warmth or food or clothing so strong that it impelled me to try again <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor sandy soil grew nothing but briars and small cactuses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the dark i kept treading on the little prickly plants but i hurried on till i came in sight of samsons fire <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see his huge form as it intercepted the comfortable blaze <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i pictured him making his tea broiling some of williams trout and spreading his things before the fire to dry <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see the animals moving around the glow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in this frame of mind the attempt was irresistible <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i started as near as i could from opposite the two islands <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as on horseback i got pretty easily to the first island <end> <end> 
<start> <start> beyond this i was taken off my feet by the stream and only with difficulty did i once more regain the land <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my next object was to communicate with samson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by putting both hands to my mouth and shouting with all my force i made him hear <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i could see him get up and come to the waters edge though he could not see me his stentorian voice is that you william <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you remember a bend near some willows where you wanted to cross yesterday <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will see me by daylight in the morning <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i start you will take my mare my clothes and some food make for that place and wait till i come <end> <end> 
<start> <start> keep me in sight as long as you can <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it will be gathered from my words that definite instructions were deemed necessary and the inference at least it was mine will follow that if a mistake were possible samson would avail himself of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia always noticeably restless at dinner was somewhat apathetic toward the advocate of peptonized chocolate and was plainly concerned about the sudden departure of m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roux who had announced that it would be necessary for him to leave tomorrow <end> <end> 
<start> <start> emile roux who sat at flavias right was a man in middle life and quite bald clearly without personal vanity though his publishers preferred to circulate only those of his portraits taken in his ambrosial youth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen was considerably shocked at his unlikeness to the slender blackstocked rolla he had looked at twenty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had declined into the florid settled heaviness of indifference and approaching age <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was however a certain look of durability and solidity about him the look of a man who has earned the right to be fat and bald and even silent at dinner if he chooses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> throughout the discussion between wellington and will maidenwood though they invited his participation he remained silent betraying no sign either of interest or contempt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> since his arrival he had directed most of his conversation to hamilton who had never read one of his twelve great novels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the night of his arrival jules martel had enthusiastically declared there are schools and schools manners and manners but roux is roux and paris sets its watches by his clock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia bad already repeated this remark to imogen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it haunted her and each time she quoted it she was impressed anew <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia shifted the conversation uneasily evidently exasperated and excited by her repeated failures to draw the novelist out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> monsieur roux she began abruptly with her most animated smile i remember so well a statement i read some years ago in your mes etudes des femmes to the effect that you had never met a really intellectual woman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> may i ask without being impertinent whether that assertion still represents your experience <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i meant madam said the novelist conservatively intellectual in a sense very special as we say of men in whom the purely intellectual functions seem almost independent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you still think a woman so constituted a mythical personage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> iune medusei madam who if she were discovered would transmute us all into stone said the novelist bowing gravely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she existed at all he added deliberately it was my business to find her and she has cost me many a vain pilgrimage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> like rudel of tripoli i have crossed seas and penetrated deserts to seek her out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have indeed encountered women of learning whose industry i have been compelled to respect many who have possessed beauty and charm and perplexing cleverness a few with remarkable information and a sort of fatal facility <end> <end> 
<start> <start> queried flavia with that fervid enthusiasm with which she could on occasion utter things simply incomprehensible for their banalityat her feats of this sort miss broadwood was wont to sit breathless with admiration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madam while the intellect was undeniably present in the performances of those women it was only the stick of the rocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although this woman has eluded me i have studied her conditions and perturbances as astronomers conjecture the orbits of planets they have never seen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she exists she is probably neither an artist nor a woman with a mission but an obscure personage with imperative intellectual needs who absorbs rather than produces <end> <end> 
<start> <start> flavia still nodding nervously fixed a strained glance of interrogation upon m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you think she would be a woman whose first necessity would be to know whose instincts would be satisfied only with the best who could draw from others appreciative merely <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the novelist lifted his dull eyes to his interlocutress with an untranslatable smile and a slight inclination of his shoulders <end> <end> 
<start> <start> exactly so you are really remarkable madam he added in a tone of cold astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after dinner the guests took their coffee in the music room where schemetzkin sat down at the piano to drum ragtime and give his celebrated imitation of the boardingschool girls execution of chopin <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he flatly refused to play anything more serious and would practice only in the morning when he had the music room to himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roux repaired to the smoking room to discuss the necessity of extending the tax on manufactured articles in franceone of those conversations which particularly exasperated flavia <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after schemetzkin had grimaced and tortured the keyboard with malicious vulgarities for half an hour signor donati to put an end to his torture consented to sing and flavia and imogen went to fetch arthur to play his accompaniments <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hamilton rose with an annoyed look and placed his cigarette on the mantel <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why yes flavia ill accompany him provided he sings something with a melody italian arias or ballads and provided the recital is not interminable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you but i have some letters to write replied the novelist bowing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as flavia had remarked to imogen arthur really played accompaniments remarkably well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to hear him recalled vividly the days of her childhood when he always used to spend his business vacations at her mothers home in maine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had possessed for her that almost hypnotic influence which young men sometimes exert upon little girls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a sort of phantom love affair subjective and fanciful a precocity of instinct like that tender and maternal concern which some little girls feel for their dolls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet this childish infatuation is capable of all the depressions and exaltations of love itself it has its bitter jealousies cruel disappointments its exacting caprices <end> <end> 
<start> <start> summer after summer she had awaited his coming and wept at his departure indifferent to the gayer young men who had called her their sweetheart and laughed at everything she said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> although hamilton never said so she had been always quite sure that he was fond of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when he pulled her up the river to hunt for fairy knolls shut about by low hanging willows he was often silent for an hour at a time yet she never felt he was bored or was neglecting her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he would lie in the sand smoking his eyes halfclosed watching her play and she was always conscious that she was entertaining him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes he would take a copy of alice in wonderland in his pocket and no one could read it as he could laughing at her with his dark eyes when anything amused him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one else could laugh so with just their eyes and without moving a muscle of their face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though he usually smiled at passages that seemed not at all funny to the child she always laughed gleefully because he was so seldom moved to mirth that any such demonstration delighted her and she took the credit of it entirely to herself her own inclination had been for serious stories with sad endings like the little mermaid which he had once told her in an unguarded moment when she had a cold and was put to bed early on her birthday night and cried because she could not have her party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he highly disapproved of this preference and had called it a morbid taste and always shook his finger at her when she asked for the story <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when she had been particularly good or particularly neglected by other people then he would sometimes melt and tell her the story and never laugh at her if she enjoyed the sad ending even to tears <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when flavia had taken him away and he came no more she wept inconsolably for the space of two weeks and refused to learn her lessons <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then she found the story of the little mermaid herself and forgot him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> imogen had discovered at dinner that he could still smile at one secretly out of his eyes and that he had the old manner of outwardly seeming bored but letting you know that he was not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was intensely curious about his exact state of feeling toward his wife and more curious still to catch a sense of his final adjustment to the conditions of life in general <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this she could not help feeling she might get againif she could have him alone for an hour in some place where there was a little river and a sandy cove bordered by drooping willows and a blue sky seen through white sycamore boughs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that evening before retiring flavia entered her husbands room where be sat in his smoking jacket in one of his favorite low chairs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose its a grave responsibility to bring an ardent serious young thing like imogen here among all these fascinating personages she remarked reflectively <end> <end> 
<start> <start> these grave silent girls have their own charm even for facile people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i was wondering why you got her up here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she doesnt seem to mix well with the faciles <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he spoke to me with kindness and feeling and did not introduce the subject of the horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i asked him whether he thought i should be in time for the fair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i saw some people making their way thither today said he the fair lasts three weeks and it has just commenced <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes i think i may promise you that you will be in time for the very heat of it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in a few days you will be able to mount your saddle with your arm in a sling but you must by no means appear with your arm in a sling at horncastle as people would think that your horse had flung you and that you wanted to dispose of him because he was a vicious brute <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must by all means drop the sling before you get to horncastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for three days i kept my apartment by the advice of the surgeon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i passed my time as i best could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> stretched on my bed i either abandoned myself to reflection or listened to the voices of the birds in the neighbouring garden <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sometimes as i lay awake at night i would endeavour to catch the tick of a clock which methought sounded from some distant part of the house <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man visited me twice or thrice every day to inquire into my state <end> <end> 
<start> <start> his words were few on these occasions and he did not stay long <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yet his voice and his words were kind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what surprised me most in connection with this individual was the delicacy of conduct which he exhibited in not letting a word proceed from his lips which could testify curiosity respecting who i was or whence i came <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all he knew of me was that i had been flung from my horse on my way to a fair for the purpose of disposing of the animal and that i was now his guest <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i might be a common horsedealer for what he knew yet i was treated by him with all the attention which i could have expected had i been an alderman of bostons heir and known to him as such <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the county in which i am now thought i at last must be either extraordinarily devoted to hospitality or this old host of mine must be an extraordinary individual <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the evening of the fourth day feeling tired of my confinement i put my clothes on in the best manner i could and left the chamber <end> <end> 
<start> <start> descending a flight of stairs i reached a kind of quadrangle from which branched two or three passages one of these i entered which had a door at the farther end and one on each side the one to the left standing partly open i entered it and found myself in a middlesized room with a large window or rather glassdoor which looked into a garden and which stood open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was nothing remarkable in this room except a large quantity of china <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was china on the mantelpiece china on two tables and a small beaufet which stood opposite the glassdoor was covered with china there were cups teapots and vases of various forms and on all of them i observed characters not a teapot not a teacup not a vase of whatever form or size but appeared to possess hieroglyphics on some part or other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after surveying these articles for some time with no little interest i passed into the garden in which there were small parterres of flowers and two or three trees and which where the house did not abut was bounded by a wall turning to the right by a walk by the side of a house i passed by a door probably the one i had seen at the end of the passage and arrived at another window similar to that through which i had come and which also stood open i was about to pass through it when i heard the voice of my entertainer exclaiming is that you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i entered the room which seemed to be a counterpart of the one which i had just left <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was of the same size had the same kind of furniture and appeared to be equally well stocked with china one prominent article it possessed however which the other room did not exhibit namely a clock which with its pendulum moving tickatick hung against the wall opposite to the door the sight of which made me conclude that the sound which methought i had heard in the stillness of the night was not an imaginary one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there it hung on the wall with its pendulum moving ticka tick <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old gentleman was seated in an easy chair a little way into the room having the glassdoor on his right hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on a table before him lay a large open volume in which i observed roman letters as well as characters <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a few inches beyond the book on the table covered all over with hieroglyphics stood a china vase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the eyes of the old man were fixed upon it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sit down said he motioning me with his hand to a stool close by but without taking his eyes from the vase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant make it out said he at last removing his eyes from the vase and leaning back on the chair i cant make it out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wish i could assist you said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> assist me said the old man looking at me with a half smile <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said i but i dont understand chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose not said the old man with another slight smile but but pray proceed said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wished to ask you said the old man how you knew that the characters on yon piece of crockery were chinese or indeed that there was such a language <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i knew the crockery was china said i and naturally enough supposed what was written upon it to be chinese as for there being such a language the english have a language the french have a language and why not the chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said i i know a little of two or three <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes a little welsh and a little haik <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am glad to see you in my house said the old man shaking me by the hand how singular that one coming as you did should know armenian <end> <end> 
<start> <start> not more singular said i than that one living in such a place as this should know chinese <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the old man looked at me and sighed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i beg pardon said i for asking what is perhaps an impertinent question i have not imitated your own delicacy you have never asked me a question without first desiring permission and here i have been days and nights in your house an intruder on your hospitality and you have never so much as asked me who i am <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in forbearing to do that said the old man i merely obeyed the chinese precept ask no questions of a guest it is written on both sides of the teapot out of which you have had your tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have reason to think so said the old man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have been occupied upon it fiveandthirty years and i am still very imperfectly acquainted with it at least i frequently find upon my crockery sentences the meaning of which to me is very dark though it is true these sentences are mostly verses which are of course more difficult to understand than mere prose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> are your chinese studies said i confined to crockery literature <end> <end> 
<start> <start> entirely said the old man i read nothing else <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have heard said i that the chinese have no letters but that for every word they have a separate character is it so <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for every word they have a particular character said the old man though to prevent confusion they have arranged their words under two hundred and fourteen what we should call radicals but which they call keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as we arrange all our words in a dictionary under twentyfour letters so do they arrange all their words or characters under two hundred and fourteen radical signs the simplest radicals being the first and the more complex the last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> does the chinese resemble any of the european languages in words <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i am scarcely competent to inform you said the old man but i believe not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said i pointing to one on the vase <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a knife said the old man that character is one of the simplest radicals or keys <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a strange word for a knife is it not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you were never at school at edinburgh i suppose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that accounts for your not knowing the meaning of tawse said i had you received the rudiments of a classical education at the high school you would have known the meaning of tawse full well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is a leathern thong with which refractory urchins are recalled to a sense of their duty by the dominie <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot see what the two words have in common except a slight agreement in sound <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will see the connection said i when i inform you that the thong from the middle to the bottom is cut or slit into two or three parts from which slits or cuts unless i am very much mistaken it derives its name tawse a thong with slits or cuts used for chastising disorderly urchins at the high school from the french tailler to cut evidently connected with the chinese tau a knife how very extraordinary <end> <end> 
<start> <start> convalescence the surgeons bill letter of recommendation commencement of the old mans history <end> <end> 
<start> <start> two days three days passed away and i still remained at the house of my hospitable entertainer my bruised limb rapidly recovering the power of performing its functions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i passed my time agreeably enough sometimes in my chamber communing with my own thoughts sometimes in the stable attending to and not unfrequently conversing with my horse and at mealtime for i seldom saw him at any other discoursing with the old gentleman sometimes on the chinese vocabulary sometimes on chinese syntax and once or twice on english horseflesh though on this latter subject notwithstanding his descent from a race of horsetraders he did not enter into with much alacrity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a small requital for his kindness i gave him one day after dinner unasked a brief account of my history and pursuits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he listened with attention and when it was concluded thanked me for the confidence which i had reposed in him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will tell you my own history it is brief but may perhaps not prove uninteresting to you though the relation of it will give me some pain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> pray then do not recite it said i <end> <end> 
<start> <start> yes said the old man i will tell you for i wish you to know it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was about to begin when he was interrupted by the arrival of the surgeon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon examined into the state of my bruised limb and told me what indeed i already well knew that it was rapidly improving <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you will not even require a sling said he to ride to horncastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i think if you are a tolerably good horseman you may mount the day after tomorrow answered the medical man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bythebye are you acquainted with anybody at horncastle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then you would scarcely find stableroom for your horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but i am happy to be able to assist you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i have a friend there who keeps a small inn and who during the time of the fair keeps a stall vacant for any quadruped i may bring until he knows whether i am coming or not <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will give you a letter to him and he will see after the accommodation of your horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tomorrow i will pay you a farewell visit and bring you the letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thank you said i and do not forget to bring your bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon looked at the old man who gave him a peculiar nod <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said he in reply to me for the little service i have rendered you i require no remuneration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you are in my friends house and he and i understand each other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never receive such favours said i as you have rendered me without remunerating them therefore i shall expect your bill <end> <end> 
<start> <start> just as you please said the surgeon and shaking me by the hand more warmly than he had hitherto done he took his leave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> on the evening of the next day the last which i spent with my kind entertainer i sat at tea with him in a little summerhouse in his garden partially shaded by the boughs of a large figtree <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the surgeon had shortly before paid me his farewell visit and had brought me the letter of introduction to his friend at horncastle and also his bill which i found anything but extravagant <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after we had each respectively drank the contents of two cups and it may not be amiss here to inform the reader that though i took cream with my tea as i always do when i can procure that addition the old man like most people bred up in the country drank his without it he thus addressed me i am as i told you on the night of your accident the son of a breeder of horses a respectable and honest man <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when i was about twenty he died leaving me his only child a comfortable property consisting of about two hundred acres of land and some fifteen hundred pounds in money <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my mother had died about three years previously <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i felt the death of my mother keenly but that of my father less than was my duty indeed truth compels me to acknowledge that i scarcely regretted his death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the cause of this want of proper filial feeling was the opposition which i had experienced from him in an affair which deeply concerned me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i had formed an attachment for a young female in the neighbourhood who though poor was of highly respectable birth her father having been a curate of the established church <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was at the time of which i am speaking an orphan having lost both her parents and supported herself by keeping a small school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my attachment was returned and we had pledged our vows but my father who could not reconcile himself to her lack of fortune forbade our marriage in the most positive terms <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was wrong for she was a fortune in herself amiable and accomplished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cannot tell you all she was and here the old man drew his hand across his eyes <end> <end> 
<start> <start> by the death of my father the only obstacle to our happiness appeared to be removed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the viscount must certainly have made a mistake thought chupin there is no such shop on the quai <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was wrong however for after passing the rue de soissons he espied the red lantern of a tobaccoshop glimmering through the fog <end> <end> 
<start> <start> having almost reached the goal chupin slackened his pace <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he approached the shop very cautiously and peered inside deeming it prudent to reconnoitre a little before he went in <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and certainly there was nothing to prevent a prolonged scrutiny <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the night was very dark the quay deserted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no one was to be seen not a sound broke the stillness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the darkness the surroundings and the silence were sinister enough to make even chupin shudder though he was usually as thoroughly at home in the loneliest and most dangerous byways of paris as an honest man of the middle classes would be in the different apartments of his modest household <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that scoundrels wife must have less than a hundred thousand a year if she takes up her abode here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and in fact nothing could be more repulsive than the tenement in which madame paul had installed herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was but one story high and built of clay and it had fallen to ruin to such an extent that it had been found necessary to prop it up with timber and to nail some old boards over the yawning fissures in the walls <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if i lived here i certainly shouldnt feel quite at ease on a windy day continued chupin sotto voce <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the shop itself was of a fair size but most wretched in its appointments and disgustingly dirty <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the floor was covered with that black and glutinous coaldust which forms the soil of the quai de la seine <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an auctioneer would have sold the entire stock and fixtures for a few shillings <end> <end> 
<start> <start> four stone jars and a couple of pairs of scales a few odd tumblers filled with pipes and packets of cigarettes some wineglasses and three or four labelled bottles five or six boxes of cigars and as many packages of musty tobacco constituted the entire stock in trade <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as chupin compared this vile den with the viscounts luxurious abode his blood fairly boiled in his veins <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he ought to be shot for this if for nothing else he muttered through his set teeth <end> <end> 
<start> <start> to let his wife die of starvation here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chupin who had seen her years before recognized her now as she sat behind her counter although she was cruelly changed <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had used her maiden name in speaking of her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was undoubtedly still youngbut sorrow regret and privations days spent in hard work to earn a miserable subsistence and nights spent in weeping had made her old haggard and wrinkled before her time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of her once remarkable beauty naught remained but her hair which was still magnificent though it was in wild disorder and looked as if it had not been touched by a comb for weeks and her big black eyes which gleamed with the phosphorescent and destructive brilliancy of fever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything about her person bespoke terrible reverses borne without dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if she had struggled at first it was easy to see that she struggled no longer <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her attireher torn and soiled silk dress and her dirty caprevealed thorough indolence and that morbid indifference which at times follows great misfortunes with weak natures <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heres a girl who was brought up like a queen and allowed to have her own way in everything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if any one had predicted this in those days how she would have sneered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i can see her now as she looked that day when i met her driving her gray ponies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if people didnt clear the road it was so much the worse for them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in those times paris was like some great shop where she could select whatever she chose <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she said i want this and she got it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she saw a handsome young fellow and wanted him for her husband her father who could refuse her nothing consented and now behold the result <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he had lingered longer at the window than he had meant to do perhaps because he could see that the young woman was talking with some person in a back room the door of which stood open <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chupin tried to find out who this person was but he did not succeed and he was about to go in when suddenly he saw madame paul rise from her seat and say a few words with an air of displeasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this time her eyes instead of turning to the open door were fixed on a part of the shop directly opposite her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is there some one there as well then <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he changed his post of observation and by standing on tiptoe he succeeded in distinguishing a puny little boy some three or four years old and clad in rags who was playing with the remnants of a toyhorse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the sight of this child increased chupins indignation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the rascal not only deserts his wife but he leaves his child to starve <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we may as well make a note of that and when we settle up our accounts he shall pay dearly for his villainy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with this threat he brusquely entered the shop <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and he handed her the missive which florent had confided to his care <end> <end> 
<start> <start> madame paul took hold of it with some hesitation eying the messenger suspiciously meanwhile but on seeing the handwriting she uttered a cry of surprise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and turning toward the open door she called m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its from himits from my husband from paul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a baldheaded corpulent man who looked some fifty years of age now timidly emerged from the room behind the shop with a cap in his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> my dear child he said in an oily voice what was i telling you just now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> everything comes to those who know how to wait <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however she had already broken the seal and she was now reading the letter eagerly clapping her hands with delight as she finished its perusal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes frightenedhe begs me to wait a littlelookread <end> <end> 
<start> <start> mouchon could not read without his spectacles and he lost at least two minutes in searching his pockets before he found them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when they were adjusted the light was so dim that it took him at least three minutes more to decipher the missive <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chupin had spent this time in scrutinizingin appraising the man as it were <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes a middle class man thats evident from his linen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> hes marriedtheres a weddingring on his finger he has a daughter for the ends of his necktie are embroidered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he lives in the neighborhood for well dressed as he is he wears a cap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but what was he doing there in that back room in the dark <end> <end> 
<start> <start> answered madame paul as she took up the letter and read it again with her eyes sparkling with joy <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you must strike the iron while its hot <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he promises me to promise and to keep ones promises are two different things <end> <end> 
<start> <start> tell him but he stopped short calling her attention with a gesture to the messenger whose eyes were glittering with intense curiosity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so filling a glass with some liquor she placed it before chupin and offered him a cigar saying take a seat heres something to keep you from feeling impatient while you wait here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thereupon she followed the old gentleman into the adjoining room and closed the door <end> <end> 
<start> <start> even if chupin had not possessed the precocious penetration he owed to his life of adventure the young woman and the old gentleman had said enough to enable him to form a correct estimate of the situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was certain now that he knew the contents of the letter as perfectly as if he had read it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> de coralths anger and his order to make haste were both explained <end> <end> 
<start> <start> moreover chupin distinctly saw what connection there was between the letter to the baroness and the letter to madame paul <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he understood that one was the natural consequence of the other <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deserted by her husband madame paul had at last become weary of poverty and privations <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had instituted a search for her husband and having found him she had written to him in this style i consent to abstain from interfering with you but only on conditions that you provide means of subsistence for me your lawfully wedded wife and for your child <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if you refuse i shall urge my claims and ruin you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the scandal wont be of much use to me its true but at least i shall no longer be obliged to endure the torture of knowing that you are surrounded by every luxury while i am dying of starvation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it might not be the precise text but no doubt it was the purport of her letter <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he knew only too well that if his wife made herself known and revealed his past it would be all over with him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> charming young men like the viscount de coralth never have any money on hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so in this emergency the dashing young fellow had written to his wife imploring her to have patience and to the baroness entreating or rather commanding her to advance him a certain sum at once <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this was no doubt the case and yet there was one circumstance which puzzled chupin exceedingly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in former years he had heard it asserted that mademoiselle flavie was the very personification of pride and that she adored her husband even to madness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> had poverty and sorrow broken her spirit to such a degree that she was willing to stoop to such shameful concessions <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if she were acquainted with her husbands present life how did it happen that she did not prefer starvation or the almshouse and a paupers grave to his assistance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chupin could understand how in a moment of passion she might be driven to denounce her husband in the presence of his fashionable acquaintances how she might be impelled to ruin him so as to avenge herself but he could not possibly understand how she could consent to profit by the ignominy of the man she loved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the plan isnt hers said chupin to himself after a moments reflection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its probably the work of that stout old gentleman <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there was a means of verifying his suspicions for on returning into the adjoining room madame paul had not taken her son with her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was still sitting on the muddy floor of the shop playing with his dilapidated horse <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the child rose and timidly approached his eyes dilating with distrust and astonishment <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the poor boys repulsive uncleanliness was a terrible charge against the mother <end> <end> 
<start> <start> did she no longer love her own offspring <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the untidiness of sorrow and poverty has its bounds <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a long time must have passed since the childs face and hands had been washed and his soiled clothes were literally falling to rags <end> <end> 
<start> <start> still he was a handsome little fellow and seemed fairly intelligent in spite of his bashfulness <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was very lighthaired and in features he was extremely like m <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chupin took him on his knees and after looking to see if the door communicating with the inner room were securely closed he asked whats your name little chap <end> <end> 
<start> <start> doesnt your mother ever talk to you about him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said anthea and ran up to him with the ring in her hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he said in tones of joy and amazement and took the ring into his hand <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my very own said anthea it was given to ill lend you a pound said the learned gentleman with pleasure and ill take care of the ring for you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> itll be a pretty game if i dont get the money to pay for cabs for her said anthea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i sometimes think he said slowly that i am becoming insane does she say that shes the queen of babylon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this thoughttransference is more farreaching than i imagined he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i suppose i have unconsciously influenced her too <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i never thought my babylonish studies would bear fruit like this <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the pound is the thing i he ran his fingers through his thin hair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its undoubtedly a babylonian ringor it seems so to me <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i will see a doctor the moment i have she took the sovereign and ran down to the others <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now from the window of a fourwheeled cab the queen of babylon beheld the wonders of london <end> <end> 
<start> <start> buckingham palace she thought uninteresting westminster abbey and the houses of parliament little better <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she liked the tower and the river and the ships filled her with wonder and delight <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how wretched and poor and neglected they seem she said as the cab rattled along the mile end road <end> <end> 
<start> <start> do you suppose i dont know a slaves face when i see it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> why dont their masters see that theyre better fed and better no one answered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the wagesystem of modern england is a little difficult to explain in three words even if you understand itwhich the children didnt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youll have a revolt of your slaves if youre not careful said the queen <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh no said cyril you see they have votesthat makes them safe not to revolt <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what do i dont know said the harassed cyril its just a vote i see said the queen a sort of plaything <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well i wish that all these slaves may have in their hands this moment their fill instantly all the people in the mile end road and in all the other streets where poor people live found their hands full of things to eat and drink <end> <end> 
<start> <start> from the cab window could be seen persons carrying every kind of food and bottles and cans as well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> roast meat fowls red lobsters great yellowy crabs fried fish boiled pork beefsteak puddings baked onions mutton pies most of the young people had oranges and sweets and cake <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it made an enormous change in the look of the mile end roadbrightened it up so to speak and brightened up more than you can possibly imagine the faces of the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thats the best wish youve had yet said jane with cordial approval <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i aint agoin to drive you no further he said <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i wants my tea he said and they saw that on the box of the cab was a mound of cabbage with pork chops and apple sauce a duck and a spotted currant pudding <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you pay me my fare he said threateningly and looked down at the mound muttering again about his tea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> well take another cab said cyril with dignity <end> <end> 
<start> <start> give me but the cabman as it turned out was not at all a nice character <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he took the sovereign whipped up his horse and disappeared in the stream of cabs and omnibuses and wagons without giving them any change at all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> already a little crowd was collecting round the party <end> <end> 
<start> <start> come on said robert leading the wrong way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they were in a narrow street where many gentlemen in black coats and without hats were standing about on the pavement talking very loudly <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how ugly their clothes are said the queen of babylon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> theyd be rather fine men some of them if they were dressed decently especially the ones with the beautiful long curved noses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the moment the almost fainting psammead had blown itself out every man in throgmorton street appeared abruptly in babylonian full dress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> all were carefully powdered their hair and beards were scented and curled their garments richly embroidered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they wore rings and armlets flat gold collars and swords and impossiblelooking headdresses <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i say a youth who had always been fairhaired broke that silence its only fancy of coursesomething wrong with my rum said his friend <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and your hairs gone black and youve got a beard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its my old levinstein dont look so bad <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but how was it donethats what i want to know <end> <end> 
<start> <start> is it conjuring or i think it is chust a ver bad tream said old levinstein to his clerk all along bishopsgate i haf seen the gommon people have their hants full of foodgoot food <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh yes without doubt then im dreaming too sir said the clerk looking down at his legs with an expression of loathing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> besides this the hollow promises of the witches had filled him with a false confidence and he remembered the sayings of the spirits that none of woman born was to hurt him and that he was never to be vanquished till birnam wood should come to dunsinane which he thought could never be <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he shut himself up in his castle whose impregnable strength was such as defied a siege here he sullenly waited the approach of malcolm <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when upon a day there came a messenger to him pale and shaking with fear almost unable to report that which he had seen for he averred that as he stood upon his watch on the hill he looked towards birnam and to his thinking the wood began to move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> cried macbeth if thou speakest false thou shalt hang alive upon the next tree till famine end thee <end> <end> 
<start> <start> if thy tale be true i care not if thou cost as much by me for macbeth now began to faint in resolution and to doubt the equivocal speeches of the spirits <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was not to fear till birnam wood should come to dunsinane and now a wood did move <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however said he if this which he avouches be true let us arm and out <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there is no flying hence nor staying here <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i begin to be weary of the sun and wish my life at an end <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with these desperate speeches he sallied forth upon the besiegers who had now come up to the castle <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the strange appearance which had given the messenger an idea of a wood moving is easily solved <end> <end> 
<start> <start> when the besieging army marched through the wood of birnam malcolm like a skilful general instructed his soldiers to hew down every one a bough and bear it before him by way of concealing the true numbers of his host <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this marching of the soldiers with boughs had at a distance the appearance which had frightened the messenger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> thus were the words of the spirit brought to pass in a sense different from that in which macbeth had understood them and one great hold of his confidence was gone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and now a severe skirmishing took place in which macbeth though feebly supported by those who called themselves his friends but in reality hated the tyrant and inclined to the party of malcolm and macduff yet fought with the extreme of rage and velour cutting to pieces all who were opposed to him till he came to where macduff was fighting <end> <end> 
<start> <start> seeing macduff and remembering the caution of the spirit who had counselled him to avoid macduff above all men he would have turned but macduff who had been seeking him through the whole fight opposed his turning and a fierce contest ensued macduff giving him many foul reproaches for the murder of his wife and children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> macbeth whose soul was charged enough with blood of that family already would still have declined the combat but macduff still urged him to it calling him tyrant murderer hellhound and villain <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then macbeth remembered the words of the spirit how none of woman born should hurt him and smiling confidently he said to macduff thou losest thy labour macduff <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as easily thou mayest impress the air with thy sword as make me vulnerable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i bear a despair thy charm said macduff and let that lying spirit whom thou hast served tell thee that macduff was never born of woman never as the ordinary manner of men is to be born but was untimely taken accursed be the tongue which tells me so said the trembling macbeth who felt his last hold of confidence give way and let never man in future believe the lying equivocations of witches and juggling spirits who deceive us in words which have double senses and while they keep their promise literally disappoint our hopes with a different then live <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said the scornful macduff we will have a show of thee as men show monsters and a painted board on which shall be written never said macbeth whose courage returned with despair i will not live to kiss the ground before young malcolms feet and to be baited with the curses of the rabble <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though birnam wood be come to dunsinane and thou opposed to me who west never born of woman yet will i try the last <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with these frantic words he threw himself upon macduff who after a severe struggle in the end overcame him and cutting off his head made a present of it to the young and lawful king malcolm who took upon him the government which by the machinations of the usurper he had so long been deprived of and ascended the throne of duncan the meek amid the acclamations of the nobles and the people <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram count of rousillon had newly come to his title and estate by the death of his father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of france loved the father of bertram and when he heard of his death he sent for his son to come immediately to his royal court in paris intending for the friendship he bore the late count to grace young bertram with his especial favour and protection <end> <end> 
<start> <start> bertram was living with his mother the widowed countess when lafeu an old lord of the french court came to conduct him to the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the king of france was an absolute monarch and the invitation to court was in the form of a royal mandate or positive command which no subject of what high dignity soever might disobey therefore though the countess in parting with this dear son seemed a second time to bury her husband whose loss she had so lately mourned yet she dared not to keep him a single day but gave instant orders for his departure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lafeu who came to fetch him tried to comfort the countess for the loss of her late lord and her sons sudden absence and he said in a courtiers flattering manner that the king was so kind a prince she would find in his majesty a husband and that he would be a father to her son meaning only that the good king would befriend the fortunes of bertram <end> <end> 
<start> <start> lafeu told the countess that the king had fallen into a sad malady which was pronounced by his physicians to be incurable <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the lady expressed great sorrow on hearing this account of the kings ill health and said she wished the father of helena a young gentlewoman who was present in attendance upon her were living for that she doubted not he could have cured his majesty of his disease <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she told lafeu something of the history of helena saying she was the only daughter of the famous physician gerard de narbon and that he had recommended his daughter to her care when he was dying so that since his death she had taken helena under her protection then the countess praised the virtuous disposition and excellent qualities of helena saying she inherited these virtues from her worthy father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> while she was speaking helena wept in sad and mournful silence which made the countess gently reprove her for too much grieving for her fathers death <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the countess parted with this dear son with tears and many blessings and commended him to the care of lafeu saying good my lord advise him for he is an bertrams last words were spoken to helena but they were words of mere civility wishing her happiness and he concluded his short farewell to her with saying be comfortable to my mother your helena had long loved bertram and when she wept in sad mournful silence the tears she shed were not for gerard de narbon <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena loved her father but in the present feeling of a deeper love the object of which she was about to lose she had forgotten the very form and features of her dead father her imagination presenting no image to her mind but bertrams <end> <end> 
<start> <start> helena had long loved bertram yet she always remembered that he was the count of rousillon descended from the most ancient family in france <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and therefore she looked up to the highborn bertram as to her master and to her dear lord and dared not form any wish but to live his servant and so living to die his vassal <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so great the distance seemed to her between his height of dignity and her lowly fortunes that she would day it were all one that i should love a bright bertrams absence filled her eyes with tears and her heart with sorrow for though she loved without hope yet it was a pretty comfort to her to see him every hour and helena would sit and look upon his dark eye his arched brow and the curls of his fine hair till she seemed to draw his portrait on the tablet of her heart that heart too capable of retaining the memory of every line in the features of that loved face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> gerard de narbon when he died left her no other portion than some prescriptions of rare and wellproved virtue which by deep study and long experience in medicine he had collected as sovereign and almost infallible remedies <end> <end> 
<start> <start> among the rest there was one set down as an approved medicine for the disease under which lafeu said the king at that time languished and when helena heard of the kings complaint she who till now had been so humble and so hopeless formed an ambitious project in her mind to go herself to paris and undertake the cure of the king <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but though helena was the possessor of this choice prescription it was unlikely as the king as well as his physicians was of opinion that his disease was incurable that they would give credit to a poor unlearned virgin if she should offer to perform a cure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amory wasnt good enough for clara clara of ripply golden hair but then no man was <end> <end> 
<start> <start> her goodness was above the prosy morals of the husbandseeker apart from the dull literature of female virtue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> sorrow lay lightly around her and when amory found her in philadelphia he thought her steely blue eyes held only happiness a latent strength a realism was brought to its fullest development by the facts that she was compelled to face <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was alone in the world with two small children little money and worst of all a host of friends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw her that winter in philadelphia entertaining a houseful of men for an evening when he knew she had not a servant in the house except the little colored girl guarding the babies overhead <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he saw one of the greatest libertines in that city a man who was habitually drunk and notorious at home and abroad sitting opposite her for an evening discussing girls boardingschools with a sort of innocent excitement <end> <end> 
<start> <start> what a twist clara had to her mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could make fascinating and almost brilliant conversation out of the thinnest air that ever floated through a drawingroom <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the idea that the girl was povertystricken had appealed to amorys sense of situation <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he arrived in philadelphia expecting to be told that ark street was in a miserable lane of hovels <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he was even disappointed when it proved to be nothing of the sort <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was an old house that had been in her husbands family for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> an elderly aunt who objected to having it sold had put ten years taxes with a lawyer and pranced off to honolulu leaving clara to struggle with the heatingproblem as best she could <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so no wildhaired woman with a hungry baby at her breast and a sad amelialike look greeted him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> instead amory would have thought from his reception that she had not a care in the world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a calm virility and a dreamy humor marked contrasts to her levelheadednessinto these moods she slipped sometimes as a refuge <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she could do the most prosy things though she was wise enough never to stultify herself with such household arts as knitting and embroidery yet immediately afterward pick up a book and let her imagination rove as a formless cloud with the wind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> deepest of all in her personality was the golden radiance that she diffused around her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as an open fire in a dark room throws romance and pathos into the quiet faces at its edge so she cast her lights and shadows around the rooms that held her until she made of her prosy old uncle a man of quaint and meditative charm metamorphosed the stray telegraph boy into a pucklike creature of delightful originality <end> <end> 
<start> <start> at first this quality of hers somehow irritated amory <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he considered his own uniqueness sufficient and it rather embarrassed him when she tried to read new interests into him for the benefit of what other adorers were present <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt as if a polite but insistent stagemanager were attempting to make him give a new interpretation of a part he had conned for years <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but clara talking clara telling a slender tale of a hatpin and an inebriated man and herself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> people tried afterward to repeat her anecdotes but for the life of them they could make them sound like nothing whatever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they gave her a sort of innocent attention and the best smiles many of them had smiled for long there were few tears in clara but people smiled mistyeyed at her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> very occasionally amory stayed for little halfhours after the rest of the court had gone and they would have bread and jam and tea late in the afternoon or maplesugar lunches as she called them at night <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amory was becoming trite from where he perched in the centre of the diningroom table one six oclock <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was searching out napkins in the sideboard <end> <end> 
<start> <start> one of those people who have no interest in anything but their children <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he asked her the one thing that he knew might embarrass her <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was the remark that the first bore made to adam <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she gave the answer that adam must have given <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but eventually adam probably told the bore all the things he thought about at night when the locusts sang in the sandy grass and he must have remarked patronizingly how different he was from eve forgetting how different she was from him at any rate clara told amory much about herself that evening <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she had had a harried life from sixteen on and her education had stopped sharply with her leisure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> browsing in her library amory found a tattered gray book out of which fell a yellow sheet that he impudently opened <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it was a poem that she had written at school about a gray convent wall on a gray day and a girl with her cloak blown by the wind sitting atop of it and thinking about the manycolored world <end> <end> 
<start> <start> as a rule such sentiment bored him but this was done with so much simplicity and atmosphere that it brought a picture of clara to his mind of clara on such a cool gray day with her keen blue eyes staring out trying to see her tragedies come marching over the gardens outside <end> <end> 
<start> <start> how he would have loved to have come along and seen her on the wall and talked nonsense or romance to her perched above him in the air <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he began to be frightfully jealous of everything about clara of her past of her babies of the men and women who flocked to drink deep of her cool kindness and rest their tired minds as at an absorbing play <end> <end> 
<start> <start> about half the world do she admitted but i think thats a pretty good average dont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and she turned to find something in browning that bore on the subject <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she was the only person he ever met who could look up passages and quotations to show him in the middle of the conversation and yet not be irritating to distraction <end> <end> 
<start> <start> she did it constantly with such a serious enthusiasm that he grew fond of watching her golden hair bent over a book brow wrinkled ever so little at hunting her sentence <end> <end> 
<start> <start> through early march he took to going to philadelphia for weekends <end> <end> 
<start> <start> almost always there was some one else there and she seemed not anxious to see him alone for many occasions presented themselves when a word from her would have given him another delicious halfhour of adoration <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but he fell gradually in love and began to speculate wildly on marriage <end> <end> 
<start> <start> though this design flowed through his brain even to his lips still he knew afterward that the desire had not been deeply rooted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> once he dreamt that it had come true and woke up in a cold panic for in his dream she had been a silly flaxen clara with the gold gone out of her hair and platitudes falling insipidly from her changeling tongue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but she was the first fine woman he ever knew and one of the few good people who ever interested him <end> <end> 
<start> <start> amory had decided that most good people either dragged theirs after them as a liability or else distorted it to artificial geniality and of course there were the everpresent prig and phariseebut amory never included them over her gray and velvet dress under her molten beaten hair color of rose in mock distress flushes and fades and makes her fair fills the air from her to him with light and languor and little sighs just so subtly he scarcely knows <end> <end> 
<start> <start> things that are spontaneous in each of usor were originally <end> <end> 
<start> <start> youre implying that i havent used myself very well <end> <end> 
<start> <start> a man of course has to go through a lot more and ive been sheltered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> oh dont stall please clara amory interrupted but do talk about me a little wont you <end> <end> 
<start> <start> wellno you have tremendous vanity but itll amuse the people who notice its preponderance <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you sink to the third hell of depression when you think youve been slighted <end> <end> 
<start> <start> of course noti can never judge a man while hes talking <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but im not through the reason you have so little real selfconfidence even though you gravely announce to the occasional philistine that you think youre a genius is that youve attributed all sorts of atrocious faults to yourself and are trying to live up to them <end> <end> 
<start> <start> for instance youre always saying that you are a slave to highballs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and you say youre a weak character that youve no will <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he gave us a lot of good advice about not going into business too young and about doing our lessons just swatting a bit on our own hook so as not to be put in a low form when we went back to school <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and all the time he was stroking the sovereign and looking at it as if he thought it very beautiful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and so it was for it was a new one <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then at last he held it out to dicky and when dicky put out his hand for it the g <end> <end> 
<start> <start> suddenly put the sovereign back in his pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> no he said i wont give you the sovereign <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ill give you fifteen shillings and this nice bottle of scent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> its worth far more than the five shillings im charging you for it <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when you can you shall pay me back the pound and sixty per cent whats that <end> <end> 
<start> <start> said hed tell us that when we paid back the sovereign but sixty per cent was nothing to be afraid of <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and the boy was made to call a cab and the g <end> <end> 
<start> <start> put us in and shook hands with us all and asked alice to give him a kiss so she did and h <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would do it too though his face was dirtier than ever <end> <end> 
<start> <start> paid the cabman and told him what station to go to and so we went home <end> <end> 
<start> <start> that evening father had a letter by the sevenoclock post <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and when he had read it he came up into the nursery <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he did not look quite so unhappy as usual but he looked grave <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it took a long time and father sat in the armchair <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he doesnt often come and talk to us now <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he has to spend all his time thinking about his business <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you havent done any harm this time children rather good than is he a friend of yours father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is an acquaintance said my father frowning a little we have done some business together <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and this letter he stopped and then said no you didnt do any harm today but i want you for the future not to do anything so serious as to try to buy a partnership without consulting me thats all <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i dont want to interfere with your plays and pleasures but you will consult me of course we said we should be delighted but then alice who was father said i havent much time to be with you for my business takes most of my time <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is an anxious business but i cant he looked so sad we all said we liked being alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then alice said we dont mean that exactly father <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is rather lonely sometimes since mother died <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then we were all quiet a little while <end> <end> 
<start> <start> father stayed with us till we went to bed and when he said good night he looked quite cheerful <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so we told him so and he said well the fact is that letter took a weight off my mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> i cant think what he meant but i am sure the g <end> <end> 
<start> <start> would be pleased if he could know he had taken a weight off somebodys mind <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he is that sort of man i think <end> <end> 
<start> <start> it is not quite such good scent as we thought it would be but we had fifteen shillings and they were all good so is the g <end> <end> 
<start> <start> and until those fifteen shillings were spent we felt almost as jolly as though our fortunes had been properly restored <end> <end> 
<start> <start> you do not notice your general fortune so much as long as you have money in your pocket <end> <end> 
<start> <start> this is why so many children with regular pocketmoney have never felt it their duty to seek for treasure <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so perhaps our not having pocketmoney was a blessing in disguise <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but the disguise was quite impenetrable like the villains in the books and it seemed still more so when the fifteen shillings were all spent <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then at last the others agreed to let oswald try his way of seeking for treasure but they were not at all keen about it and many a boy less firm than oswald would have chucked the whole thing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> but oswald knew that a hero must rely on himself alone <end> <end> 
<start> <start> so he stuck to it and presently the others saw their duty and backed him up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> chapter oswald is a boy of firm and unswerving character and he had never wavered from his first idea <end> <end> 
<start> <start> he felt quite certain that the books were right and that the best way to restore fallen fortunes was to rescue an old gentleman in distress <end> <end> 
<start> <start> then he brings you up as his own son but if you preferred to go on being your own fathers son i expect the old gentleman would make it up to you some other way <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in the books the least thing does it you put up the railway carriage window or you pick up his purse when he drops it or you say a hymn when he suddenly asks you to and then your fortune is made <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the others as i said were very slack about it and did not seem to care much about trying the rescue <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they said there wasnt any deadly peril and we should have to make one before we could rescue the old gentleman from it but oswald didnt see that that mattered <end> <end> 
<start> <start> however he thought he would try some of the easier ways first by himself <end> <end> 
<start> <start> commander of the carpathia which rescued the survivors of the titanic from the lifeboats in the open sea and brought them to new york <end> <end> 
<start> <start> after the senatorial investigating committee had examined captain rostrom at which time this specially posed photograph was taken senator william alden smith chairman of the committee said of captain rostrom his conduct of the rescue shows that he is not only an efficient seaman but one not thought of danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> later we were told to get up and i hurriedly dressed the baby <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we hastened up on deck and confusion was all about <end> <end> 
<start> <start> with other women and children we clambered to the lifeboats just as a matter of precaution believing that there was no immediate danger <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in about an hour there was an explosion and the ship appeared to fall apart <end> <end> 
<start> <start> we were in the lifeboat about six hours before we were picked up <end> <end> 
<start> <start> probably few deaths have caused more tears than arthur ryersons in view of the sad circumstances which called him home from a lengthy tour in europe <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ryersons eldest son arthur larned ryerson a yale student was killed in an automobile accident easter monday a cablegram announcing the death plunged the ryerson family into mourning and they boarded the first steamship for this country <end> <end> 
<start> <start> ifsic happened to be the titanic and the death note came near being the cause of the blotting out of the entire family <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the children who accompanied them were miss susan p <end> <end> 
<start> <start> they did not know their son intended to spend the easter holidays at their home at haverford pa <end> <end> 
<start> <start> john lewis hoffman also of haverford and a student of yale was killed with young ryerson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the two were hurrying to philadelphia to escort a fellow student to his train <end> <end> 
<start> <start> in turning out of the road to pass a cart the motor car crashed into a pole in front of the entrance to the estate of mrs <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the college men were picked up unconscious and died in the bryn mawr hospital <end> <end> 
<start> <start> heide norris of philadelphia who went to new york to meet the surviving members of the ryerson family told of a happy incident at the last moment as the carpathia swung close to the pier <end> <end> 
<start> <start> there had been no positive information that young jack ryerson was among those saved indeed it was feared that he had gone down with the titanic like his father arthur ryerson <end> <end> 
<start> <start> norris spoke of the feeling of relief that came over him as watching from the pier he saw jack ryerson come from a cabin and stand at the railing <end> <end> 
<start> <start> the name of the boy was missing from some of the lists and for two days it was reported that he had perished <end> <end> 
<start> <start> less than hours after the cunard line steamship carpathia came in as a rescue ship with survivors of the titanic disaster she sailed again for the mediterranean cruise which she originally started upon last week <end> <end>
